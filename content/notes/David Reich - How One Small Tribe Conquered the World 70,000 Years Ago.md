- Embrace Change: Adaptation Over Time
  Summary:
  Natural selection has consistently favored genetic variations that reduce body fat and susceptibility to conditions like type 2 diabetes over the past 10,000 years.
  This trend suggests a shift from a feast-and-famine lifestyle to one where food availability is more stable, making the ability to store fat less advantageous. Such adaptation challenges the notion that agriculture led to negative health outcomes, instead indicating a complex response to changing environmental conditions.

  The immune thing makes sense, obviously, in what diseases. In what direction is the metabolic thing pointing?
  Speaker 1
  So one example of this is that there's a very clear downward selection against body fat. Interesting. Against predisposition to high body medicine decks, predisposition to what today manifests itself as type 2 diabetes. So that genetic combination in West Eurasia has been pushed down again and again over the last 10,000 years under the pressure of natural selection without a doubt in its action on many, Many independent genetic variants, all pushing in the same direction in an overwhelmingly statistically significant way. One possible interpretation of this, and this is speculative, is that you're shifting from a mode of survival that's more feast and famine to one where food is more regular, and it's Not as advantageous to store fat. And so there's selection against sort of fat storage capacity.
  Speaker 2
  That story seems to point against the narrative that agriculture was terrible. ([Time 0:56:21](https://share.snipd.com/snip/78964b7a-610e-4a07-aefb-36ad1f2c445f))
    - **Note:** Humans change over time historical humans were many isolated groups in small bands some of which survived in their niche others struggled in the end some went extinct others dominated with little diversity. Human evolution has slowed but the most important changes recently that have been selected for was resistance to disease not enhanced cognition. Our view of old humans might be wrong where there were not genetic differences intelligence wise but people carried diseases and won or lost that way which carried evolution and selection. Our understanding of the past is wrong 90-95% of people in Europe got wiped out hitler used this to help his cause which obviously led to it being suppressed after the war but now people can’t look objectively at the data they’re doing mental gymnastics to fit the new data to the old model instead of starting from first principles. When people would come in current dogma likes to think it’s gradual integration. What likely happened from the data we see this is very quick change it looks like conquering bands roamed adopted peoples cultures integrating the good taking them over and their women. This was mostly male driven conquest and the dna doesn’t look like a mix but more a pure conquest.
- Genetic Mysteries Unraveled: The Quest for Developmental Insights
  Summary:
  Modern understanding of human genetics struggles to explain cognitive development and physical traits compared to advances made in interpreting neural responses in animals.
  Current research highlights the complex relationship between the genome and physical development, with ongoing debates about whether evolution occurs through gradual, minor changes or significant shifts in specific genetic pathways. Despite possessing rich genetic data from both modern and archaic humans, the challenge lies in decoding how adaptations manifest in response to environmental pressures.
  Analyzing human genome data over the past 10,000 years offers a unique opportunity to observe changes resulting from agriculture and urbanization, potentially yielding insights into evolutionary processes.
  A deeper understanding of genetic regulation and the parameters of AI model training might reveal parallels in these coding systems, emphasizing the need for innovative approaches to advance our grasp of genetic adaptation.

  Speaker 1
  We simply don't know the answer to your question from a genetic point of view about how modern human cognitive and other types of propensities, how they develop the biological underpinning Of the differences that modern humans have from our closest living and relatives. We just don't know how they evolved. It's not even clear how biological they were. But being able to interpret the genome in terms of how these changes occurred is we just don't know how. I was at a talk a few years ago that was really shocking to me, which was based on, there was a researcher at Caltech and she was talking about being able to directly read the brains of macaque Monkeys. Monkey would be shown 2000 photographs, and she would, and her student, would be recording from different neurons in its visual cortex and learning the neuron's response to different Images. And so what they would do is they would decompose the images of faces, human faces, into eigenvectors with the principal component analysis. And then the neurons, specific neurons were responding to particular eigenvectors. And they learned the language of how the photographs and the decomposition of them computationally mapped on to the neurons. And they actually learned a language for how that's the case. And then, what they did is they showed a 2001st photograph to the monkey. They recorded from its neurons, and then tried to use the neurons to reassemble a photograph. And it was a perfect reassembly, the photograph. They had actually completely learned how the brain, this CAC's brain, represents the photograph going through the brain representation. So in that case, they were able to completely figure out the language of appreciation of a photograph through the biological representation of it. And if you look at the parallel problem of the genome, how does the genome code for development and how we are, get to how we are today, how do we have our capacities and so on, to me it sounds Like at first principles, if you ask me what's a simpler problem, figuring out how to represent the natural world in our brain or figuring out how to code for development, I think my cognitive Bias, if you were presented ab initio, this problem, would be to say it's easier to code for development than to represent the outside world in the brain. But this group and other groups are figuring out how to do this nearly perfectly with a readout from the brain. And we really can't read a genome and tell you how a person looks, how a person develops. We can begin to say what terrible diseases they have, but not even predict that so well. And so that's very depressing that we can't actually read the genome enough to actually see how that occurs. And we actually don't even know how evolution happens. Like for example, does evolution happen by lots of little changes pushing in some direction? Like, for example, if we want to move toward a different positive set point for height or for some cognitive capacity or propensity or something, is this by infinitesimal change of Polygenicity, many genetic variants pushing in the same direction? That's the mathematicians' bias. Or is it like the example I told you about before with David Gockman and Liron Carmel, with the voice box where everything pushes in the same direction and goes up to 100% and shifts all In the same direction in an incredibly simple and simplistic way? If you talk to neuroscientists and molecular biologists, their brain tends toward the latter. And this few examples suggest that that's occurred. And so maybe this kind of polygenic paradigm of adaptation, when adaptation really matters, is that really what happens when important adaptation matters, happens? Or is it instead something simple and simplistic and reliant on a small number of genes? So what I would really like to know is can we mine the genetic data we have from modern genomes and archaic genomes? We now have Neanderthals and Denisovans. We now have some early modern humans who are far enough back in time that appreciable change may have occurred. And can we actually learn the patterns of biological adaptation well enough to actually read the code of how we change and how we adapt to new pressures? And I think that that's something that's not impossible to imagine. We can learn how to do. But it takes a different way of thinking.
  Speaker 2
  One thing that would also be interesting there is one big debate in trying to forecast AI is how big is the information content that describes the human brain? Because with AI models, we know, obviously, we can tell very easily, here's how difficult it is to, here's how many bits it takes to encode the parameters. But if you want to go back to, like, how many bits is it to encode the training paradigm itself, there's obviously this training code, then there's the hyperparameters, and here's how Many kilobytes that is. And the question is, we know that the human genome is through gigabytes, but we know only a small fraction is protein coding, and then also how do you count the percentage that is responsible For regulation and so forth. Because can we compare how big that is with respect to how big the trading code for a model is? And then it would give interesting insights into how similar those two processes are.
  Speaker 1
  So what we're beginning to be able to do, I mean, I don't know how important the particular class of work I'm involved in right now. But we're engaging with this in some way right now, because we have incredible data from Europe in the last 10,000 years with huge numbers of samples where we can watch very small changes In frequency over 10,000 years. So in this period of time, which is not a particularly important time in human evolution, it's well after the important stuff happened, it's the last 10,000 years, but it's an eventful Time. The environments became very different, the lifestyles became very different. And so this is a period of time where we've done an experiment of nature. You can push as happened against the human genome. There's agriculture, there's people living more densely, there's infectious disease happening in a different way, in a different type than before. And how does the genome respond to this traumatic set of conditions? And so you can actually watch all these little variables, all these little gene frequencies, tens of millions of them shifting up and down in coordination. And what can you learn from that? Because we now have all the measurements, right? We have a selection coefficient measured at 10 million positions across the genome. How do you... And we know what the effect of those are on traits today, because they've been measured in large numbers on the order of a million people today. So what can you do with this data set? How relevant is this to important evolution? So I think that that's the type of rich data that could potentially be mined to learn something sort of qualitatively interesting beyond the storytelling that's characterized molecular Biology, beyond the Fox P2, where you say, oh, maybe it's this, maybe t...

- The Enduring Legacy of Cultural Heritage
  Summary:
  Cultural heritability in South Asia demonstrates a remarkable consistency over millennia, preserving core myths and societal structures, such as the caste system, despite the absence of written records for thousands of years.
  Genetic data reveals a landscape of mixed ancestries dominated by ancestral North Indians and South Indians, reflecting a historic blending of three primary populations: local hunter-gatherers, early agrarian communities, and steppe pastoralists. This mixing process froze approximately two to three thousand years ago due to significant cultural changes that resulted in the establishment of the caste system, which curtailed further intermixing.
  This stability has allowed for a unique genetic and cultural snapshot that contrasts with the more fluid population dynamics seen in other regions, such as Europe.
  Notably, certain groups, like the Patels, deviate from this gradient due to distinct historical ancestries linked to Central Asia, illustrating the complexity of human genetic and cultural histories.

  All right. Well, I guess we need to find the million dollars first. But somebody, if you've got a million dollars and somebody else, if you've got the idea, we can make a market here. One of the interesting things, we're talking about the contingency of human history and human evolution. And one of the really interesting things is not only is it contingent, but it seems to be persistent, at least across the last 2,000 years, and the way that genetics have changed, culture Has changed. So when the Indo-EuropeEuropean, the Amnaya, disrupt, you know, whatever the Indus Valley Civilization 4,000 years ago or something like that, the, the, not only does that mean that The languages which are spoken in India today, or at least many of them are descended from this group, but literally the actual like core myths of Hinduism are descended from this initial Group. How is it possible that for 4000 years, the things like caste, things like basic mythology can be preserved with such high fidelity, especially in an era for half of that you don't have Writing, not half of that, for at least a couple thousand or two thousand years you don't even have writing. How is that sort of persistent cultural, heritability preserved?
  Speaker 1
  Well, you're asking me a cultural question, not a genetic one. So what you see in the genetic data from South Asia is an amazing process. So today in South Asia, almost everybody is on a gradient of ancestry with two poles, what we call the ancestral North Indians and the ancestral South Indians, with very few exceptions. The exceptions are people with your last name Patel, and as a minor exception, but it's interesting that that's your last name, but also people from Munda, like who speak Austro-Asiatic Languages or are mixed with them, or people who are Tibeto-Burman speakers. But most people are on a mixture between two poles, ancestral North Indians and ancestral South Indians. And when you look at genetic data from India, it looks like what you see today in African Americans with people with relatively higher or lower proportions of, say European and West African ancestry. And so it looks like a population in the process of mixture like African-Americans who are the result of mixture in the last 10 or so generations between two, mostly two very different Populations mixing in different proportions. But what happened in India is it froze. So the mixing started and then it froze. And the freezing happened two to three thousand years ago and it froze because of cultural change. So what happens in India is you have a three-part change. You have a arrival of three source populations, essentially parallel to what you see in Europe. There's a local hunter-gatherer population. There's what's probably a farming population, maybe also a hunter-gatherer population initially. And then there are these people descended at some level from step pastoralists. These are the three primary ancestral populations. They come together at the end of the decline of the Harappan civilization, which ends about 3,800 years ago. And groups from this Harappan group, which we actually have sampled, and all on a different gradient. They mix with the steppe groups and with the local hunter-gatherer groups to form and coalesce to these two later groups, which we call the ancestral North Indians and ancestral South Indians. And then mixtures of these two mixed populations form in the Gangetic plain, form people all along this gradient, and it's really a very simple mixture of two sources. And then the cultural change happens, which locks in the caste system, and people freeze, and they stop mixing very much. And so what you see is instead of people collapsing to a point, which is what you see in Europe after this type of mix and process of these three sources happen in any one region, you see This gradient forming, and it's stable. And because of the enduringness of the caste system, you actually have a snapshot going back a couple of thousand years and without this continuing change. And so it's kind of an amazing system genetically to look at because of people's reluctance to mix with people from very different groups in traditional communities. And the three steps are coming together of very different populations and then convulsive profound mixing of groups that had previously not mixed and then locking into this static System as the caste system sets in, which is documented in the early texts like the Rig Veda. And you can actually see the change in that discussion during the course of the Rig Veda.
  Speaker 2
  I know you're warned about being too interested in yourself, but what was it about the Patels? Why are they in exception?
  Speaker 1
  So the first good genomic data from South Asians is embarrassingly from Houston, Texas. So in the Human Haplotype Map Project, there was a sample from Houston, Texas of Gujaratis and Houston, Texas. A lot of Patels in Taihue, who's G.I And if you look at them people are actually not on this gradient, but they're in a few different places. They're clustered into groups and there's the main gradient and there's an off gradient group. And I forgot how we figured this out, but someone figured out that these people are all pattels and pattels have their own distinctive history with different relationships to people In Central Asia. And it's probably some additional ancestry from Central Asia, pushing them off the main gradient. Interesting. ([Time 1:41:39](https://share.snipd.com/snip/66b08b12-5e0c-4536-be75-8e3c720de884))
