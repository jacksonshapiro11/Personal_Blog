### Highlights

- Episode AI notes
  1. Successful companies focus on evolving both their technology and making the market receptive to their product by educating them about its value.
  2. The process of evolving a product and making the market receptive to it is likened to annealing, involving iteratively tweaking the product based on market feedback and pushing the market to understand and accept the product.
  3. Successful companies have a clear direction, understanding both the technology and market constraints, and engage in a continual process of give and take to achieve category creation, rather than relying solely on asking the market what it wants or solving their own problems.

- Evolution of Data in the Modern World
  Summary:
  In the modern business world, the traditional approach of finding product-market fit by creating a product and asking the market for feedback is not always effective.
  Instead, successful companies focus on evolving both their technology and making the market receptive to their product by educating them about its value. This process, likened to annealing, involves iteratively tweaking the product based on market feedback and pushing the market to understand and accept the product.
  Successful companies have a clear direction, understanding both the technology and market constraints, and engage in a continual process of give and take to achieve category creation, rather than relying solely on asking the market what it wants or solving their own problems.

  Maybe it's a great excuse given that a lot of these companies are in this phase of going from 0 to 10 plus million of ARR, to talk about your concept of company market annealing. It sticks out my memory as a really interesting way to think about the early stages of companies, and since so many are going through that now, could you describe that idea and that framework?
  Speaker 1
  I've read all of these books and they're all very useful about finding product market fit, but that's not how it ever seems to work. And now this time I've sat on many boards. I've watched this many times. And so the typical story in finding product market fit is you, the company, create some product and you go ask the market what it wants. And then based on its feedback, you tweak your product and you A -B test your way into finding the right thing. And so you get all these aphorisms that I find so stupid. Solve your own problem, and then you have a company, which is just not true, or solve a real problem with the customer. And it's not helpful, right? None of these things tell you actually how to find product market fit. So here's my experience of having watched it played out multiple times, which is you both have to know your technology and evolve that as well as make the market pliable and educate the Market. This is if you're doing category creation. Marketing millions is for category creation. If you're in a mature market, just go build something better. People already know how to use it. But in new markets, like the customer doesn't know the value that you have, they haven't a clue. They don't know how to use it. They don't have the workflow. So there's a ton of work that you're actually hammering the market and making it so they can accept it. And so the way that I think about it is almost like this kind of a kneeling where you work a little bit on your product and then you actually work on the market. By work on the market, I don't mean do interviews. I think this is like the most broken way of building a company. So you go ask, imagine this, you're going to go interview a customer and ask what they want. They're sitting down there and they feel like they need to answer something. So they'll just make something up. Oh, I need this. I want a pony, right? It's just almost like it's too much leading the witness. This is an essential buyer. And so the most successful companies, they have a true north. They're like, we know that this technology is involved in this way and we need to educate them on this, but there's going to be some real organizational constraints and real budget constraints. We're going to find those at the same time. So they go pull and push on the market a little bit, and then they tweak the product to do that. And then they go pull and push on the market, and they tweak the product, and they do that. And this is give and take, this is kneeling. And that's how most companies do category creation, in my opinion, not this go ask the market what it wants, or go solve your own problem, the market will just understand it. If that works for you, you're very lucky, but I've never seen it. ([Time 0:45:24](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3a61266f-36eb-4773-a0de-383413347701))

      This process, likened to annealing, involves iteratively tweaking the product based on market feedback and pushing the market to understand and accept the product. This is as much understanding the market is forcing the market to understand you.
