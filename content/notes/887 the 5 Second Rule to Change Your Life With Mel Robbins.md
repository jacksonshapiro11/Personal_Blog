### Highlights

- The Neuroscience Behind the 5 Second Rule
  Key takeaways:
  - There is a 5-second window between instincts and actions that can change one's life. If one hesitates, their brain is designed to kill their instincts. Counting backward can trigger focus and interrupt hesitation. Hesitation signals a red flag to the mind that something is up. Hesitation is a habit that can be caught and used as a moment of power to make a decision in the next 5 seconds. The 5-second rule can be used to change one's life one moment at a time.

  I understand it. You got to get moving first. Yes. That's the thing. You just got to wake up at 6 a.m. Or whatever it is and go into the gym. When you're in the gym, you're going to start moving the first way. Yes.
  Speaker 1
  And then you'll start moving the second way. Yes. Actually, people use the five second rule at the gym because you know how much time people waste at the gym standing around thinking about the next thing? Probably 70% of the time. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. So the next morning the alarm goes off and nothing had changed in my life. I woke up to the lean on the house, the fighting with Chris, the unemployment, the lack of confidence, the lack of courage, the whole thing. But I did something I had never done before. I went 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Just like NASA. I actually counted. And then I stood up and I was like, what the hell just happened? What? That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard. The next morning I used it again. I worked. The next morning I used it again. I worked. And then I started to notice something. And this is one of those things. So we have an 11-year-old son who has dyslexia. And when they finally diagnosed him, it was as if, of course, it was as if, like, how could we have possibly missed this? Are we the worst parents in the world? I mean, the kid can barely write. He can't cut his food. He doesn't. Like, no wonder he doesn't do team sports. It was right under our nose. And what I'm about to tell you is right under everybody's nose. There's a five-second window between the instincts, the shoulds, the urges, the inner wisdom, the things that can change your life if you listen to it. You've got a five-second window from the moment you feel that instinct to move. And if you don't, your brain is actually designed to kill it. Five seconds is all you have. The second you hesitate, it's action. And you feel yourself hesitating. That is a moment of huge power because what's happened is you've just started to pull back from something that you need to lean into. And if you count backwards, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and this is the neuroscience behind why this stupid little trick works, counting is an action. Counting backwards requires focus. It's also not a habit for you yet. So when you feel yourself hesitate, you're triggering your mind that something's up. Like Lewis didn't hesitate when he pulled on his pants. He didn't hesitate when he's drinking his coffee. He didn't hesitate when he walked out the door to the gym. But now he's hesitating to make that call. Your mind now goes into a cognitive bias called the spotlight effect. It magnifies whatever it was that you hesitated doing. And the moment, yeah, like all of a sudden you're like, hey, I don't feel like it. Like I don't know. Maybe I'll do it later. And your mind is doing it because your mind's trying to protect you. Hesitation signals a red flag to your mind that something's up. Just that small hesitation. It's a habit that we all have. Should you hesitate if you're getting a tattoo? Yes. Should you hesitate if you're gambling? Yes. Should you hesitate if you are signing a legal document? Yes. You need your prefrontal cortex for those things. You need to interrupt it, make a power, make a decision. Should you hesitate on making a phone call? No. Should you hesitate on speaking up in a meeting? No. Should you hesitate when you feel yourself starting to procrastinate and you know you got work that you should get done? No. You shouldn't hesitate at all. Should you hesitate in saying the thing that you're really feeling your heart? No. You shouldn't. Should you hesitate and edit yourself when you're talking? No, you shouldn't. But we've all trained ourselves too. So it's actually this habit of hesitating, you start catching yourself, it's a huge moment of power because you have a decision to make and you've got to make it in the next five seconds. Are you going to go on autopilot and get trapped in your mind? Or are you going to 54321 and awaken your prefrontal cortex and drive forward? So I started to use this rule as I noticed that every day all day long I had these moments of inner wisdom where I would know that I needed to pick up the phone and stop isolating myself. I would know that I needed to call a bunch of media companies and start auditioning for radio show hosting gigs. I knew that I should get out of bed on time. I knew I should stop myself before I snapped a Chris, right? Self monitor. I knew I should not feel let the frustration be the things that was driving me. And so I started to use the rule all day long whenever I felt this, I should do this by 4321 and I would make myself do it. And slowly five seconds at a time my entire life started to change. And my husband used it in his business and he and his business partner dove in. They went on to open seven more restaurants. I went on to launch and sell two businesses and get recruited by CNN and join their team. I had a syndicated radio show that ended up winning the Gracie Award, which is kind of the female media, you know, awards for the number one talk show in the country. And you know, I never intended to tell anybody about the five second rule. First of all, because it's stupid. I mean, come on, count backwards as a dumbest.
