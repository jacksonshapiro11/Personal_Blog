### Highlights

- Episode AI notes
  1. Small markets in the software industry, specifically the mid market, are often underserved and represent an opportunity for startups. These markets may not require highly sophisticated solutions, making them more accessible for smaller companies. Startups can find success by targeting small markets and gradually expanding their offerings.
  2. In the early days, Lattice focused on building a brand community rather than generating sales leads. They showcased HR leaders and practitioners who shared their vision, amplifying their voices through interviews and blogs. Creating a space for the community to gather and building real relationships with members was a key aspect of their marketing strategy.
  3. Balancing new product development with the growth of the core product becomes increasingly challenging as a company matures. The larger the company, the more dissociation there is between mature thinking and the scrappiness required for new product development. It is important to address this tension to avoid difficult moments before finding a resolution.
  4. Evaluating cost structure, revenue allocation, market spend, and other factors is crucial for future success. Structural changes and adjustments may be necessary to reach desired cash flow margins. Gladys aims to provide modern tools that prioritize employees and treat talent as a valuable asset, similar to how Salesforce handles pipeline and finance tracking.

- The Untapped Potential of Small Markets in the Software Industry
  Key takeaways:
  - Small markets are growing and are often underserved with software.
  - There is a lack of good software options for small to mid-sized companies (50 to 2000 employees).
  - Startups can find success by targeting small markets and gradually expanding their offerings.
  - Mid-sized companies may not require highly sophisticated solutions like those used by larger companies.

  Small markets growing. I think about that a lot when investing. And that's actually what I personally thought when we first started partnering was the mid market was sort of sneaky big and was far less served with software than we might imagine. It was everyone who moved to the cloud, obviously from on prem solutions, you had really good top down sold software. So you had Workday, right, 2004 something company. But it's like for big companies for the function. And then you had like dinky point solutions. If you were a tiny team, you technically needed to do something, but not robustly. And as you looked at a bunch of these categories, there was not really anything good for 50 to 2000. Like, if you weren't going to be at Workday or NetSuite or whatever, like, you didn't really have anything amazing. So I think that you've won the small markets that are growing in part because you can't chew off that much as a startup anyway. And so better, you chew off all of a small piece retain the customers than more of the next piece that unlocks each year. And by the time the market looks big, you've got a lot of it, hopefully. In this case, the opportunity for mid market for 50 to 2000, let's call it plus and companies to say, we're not sophisticated enough to need the dominant market adult solution.

    - **Note:** The importance of being in large markets as the guiding growth of business also starting in small niche markets then scaling. They started mid market in an underserved cohort. Going to market helps you find product market fit. They went to market with a solution realized the client need was really different and pivoted but they needed the market reaction and talking to customers to understand that. It took 2 years to figure this out. You need to also pick your market. Do you go up market or grow in your niche. What market do you want to serve. He had 2-3 customer dinners a week. You always need to build to 100mm in revenue with a through line. They understand what makes a good customer and could predict customer health based on usage. Define success for the product and be sticky. They built solutions fully in house that lead to better integration than competition who acquired solutions that created a disjointed product.
- Early Focus on Community and Marketing in Building a Brand
  Key takeaways:
  - The company focused heavily on community and marketing early on, allocating the majority of their marketing budget towards brand community rather than performance marketing or sales.
  - Their approach was to evangelize a new way of employee management and spotlight HR leaders and practitioners who were already advocating for this approach.
  - The company aimed to create a space for the community to gather and amplify the voices of underheard customers, rather than trying to be the center of attention.
  - Building real relationships and friendships with community members was a key aspect of their strategy.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  We were probably crazy early on the community and marketing side on a relative basis.
  Speaker 2
  And to be clear, I would say if you looked at it economically, so if you looked at where dollars of marketing budget went even the early years, it would be 90% of that time brand community Versus a performance marketing or sales list leads or something else, just to paint this economic, obviously not a big number when you're early.
  Speaker 1
  And even that 10% that we would spend on Facebook ads or whatever was join our community. So we weren't even trying to say, I mean, we would experiment with like, hey, here's Laddis book a demo. But in our minds, that just like didn't make sense as a user journey. Maybe today we could maybe do that. But at the time you don't know what Laddis is, you're maybe not even bought in on this kind of performance management yet. So to take somebody from, I'm just learning about Laddis on this social network or in this Google ad for the first time I've never seen this company before to I'm gonna book a 30 minute Demo to see the product that just like didn't compute for us. And so instead what we would do is we would have these touch points where we were evangelizing this new way of employee management. And the way we evangelized it, because we had come to it in 2016, instead of 2014, when nobody was thinking this way. But in 2016, there were these practitioners who were already really sharing the gospel if there's a new way to do employee management. And here's what it looks like. And at the time we had no HR experience, we were young and experienced. And so what we would do is we would just spotlight them. And so the way that we got started with the content in the community was basically taking these CHROs and even COO, like other people outside of HR would care a lot about this too. But we would take these HR leaders and we would do these really high quality video interviews with them or blogs or find ways to basically take their voice and amplify it and really high Quality ways that nobody was doing. And that led us make champions out of these people who were already preaching this thing. So our view was rather than us trying to be sort of the cult leaders of a community, we just want to put out an umbrella under which this community was gathering. And that was always the way we thought about it.
  Speaker 2
  You're a nice phrase for it. What is it? Hold the umbrella, but don't hold the microphone.
  Speaker 1
  And I think that was really important for us to not be the ones taking the spotlight, but creating this space for this under heard, under listen to customer. That's also where the real relationships and friendships come in was, I got to a point where I even felt frustrated for them that I was like, they have these important ideas and their Exec teams and CEOs aren't listening to them. That was a fuel for it. ([Time 0:25:10](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c78eea9c-84f2-43ca-a590-627eb235b683))
    - **Note:** They started building a community and evangelizing the products. They would amplify HR leaders they wouldn’t be the ones holding the spotlight but the umbrella. Celebrating the customers. Create a community where you celebrate customers and give them a voice. Selling you on a brand and system. Selling the vision. Built the suite and capabilities in house. Viewed hiring as failure as well as acquisitions. Very frugal in building. Type 2 gun not fun while you’re doing it but glad you did it like running a marathon. Constantly keep the idea that products are imperfect and evolving. They counter positioned by building a suite when everything was based on best in class apps. Building software is cheap but go to market is now expensive.
- The Challenges of Balancing New Product Development and Core Product Growth in a Maturing Company
  Key takeaways:
  - The impact of dedicating resources to new products instead of the core product is uncertain and cannot be tested multiple times.
  - As a company grows and becomes more mature, it becomes increasingly difficult to balance the needs of new product development with the demands of the existing business.
  - The larger the company, the more dissociation there is between mature thinking and the scrappiness required for new product development.
  - Investing significant time and resources in a new product can be a challenging experience, especially for a mature company operating in a difficult market.
  - As a company expands, there are more people who lack experience with early-stage startups, making it even harder to navigate the tension between innovation and existing operations.
  - The longer a company postpones addressing the tension between new product development and the core business, the more difficult it becomes to manage, leading to challenging moments before finding a resolution.

  Or the sales team is like, this is so obvious on the main product and you're pulling people through a long period there. We'll never know because we'll never get to run the experiment twice, but we spent nine months building an agent product in 2018 before we launched it. That year, our growth was linear. You'll never know if we had spent instead of putting five of our seven engineers on this thing no one was working on. If we had all seven working on the core product, would we have grown faster? You'd think so. You'll never quite know. It gets much harder as time goes on. The bigger the company gets, the more dissociation you have from the people who are thinking in mature ways and the scrappiness and immaturity that is inherent to a new product. Now today for lattice at 600 people, we just got through this big launch of this HRIS product. We spent over a year and half of our engineering project design team resources on this thing. That's a painful thing to go through where you've got this mature company in a hard market and you're spending all of that energy on this thing that doesn't exist yet. You're holding this tension of this future story out for the company where they're all like, let's hope. The bigger you get, the more people you're bringing along, the more people you have less experience with what an early-state startup looks like. Basically, it's harder and harder and harder the longer you go before the rubber band snaps and catches up with whatever post you are holding. Those last moments are just tough. ([Time 0:42:05](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3dde2115-4844-42b6-b1bc-db83784a8d3e))
    - **Note:** Building a suite is long and harder is a constraint optimization problem but you end up at scale with a more robust system. You need to sacrifice growth and resources up front to achieve this which has a lot of opportunity cost and threat of death. Optionslity can be the antithesis of intensity. Multi project journeys are tough they need a lot of focus and ceo time. They need to be very focused you need to be constantly iterating on the present and building for the future. Figure if it’s important or not important and track it deeper or kill it. Fundraising is difficult have a wartime mentality and never expect a next round is coming. Vcs want to maintain optionality so it’s never a no they want to keep you there for a possible raise but no matter what they say they’re usually playing you to some degree understand the game theory take nothing personal but play the game too they have a job to do and lie. No matter how you’re doing keep the intensity and bar high.

  Speaker 1
  One new lens that is on my mind now that there's not a way I've been thinking to date and still not quite how we're like managing the company, but I think it's going to be important between Here and day when the public market investor would be asking those questions is imagine a world where you have 20% cash flow margin on a business and like something that public investors Would be really excited about. For me, it's really easy to just like think in simple terms. And when I'm thinking about like a new product, just price times quantity and simple is good. So if you're like, okay, we get to spend 80% of our revenue on the business because we need 20% left for cash. We know that we are like a multi product company. We know what public sort of comparables look like on engineering and product spend. So let's say that the most of the markets at 22% of revenue is being spent on R&D. Maybe we're going to spend 30%. Okay, so there goes 30% G&A, like what do public companies spending? We don't have a real reason to believe them the long term will look different. So there goes another 16% or whatever. We've got some amount of customer success we need for us. Our long term gross margins are basically all to do with people costs. We think it's going to be whatever percent 82, whatever it's going to be. There goes another 18% that's just gone there. We know that we market and sell in these kind of ways, but we only have 26% left or whatever the number is. And it all has to happen in that. And then when you start to think in those terms, and then you look at where you are today, and you start to think about things like, geez, what is our net dollar retention need to be for this All to have a chance of working? What's our CAC payback period going to need to look like for this to make any sense? What ACV is doing need to have implied? What are we going to need to do on all of these different functions? From there, you can start to say, gosh, what we have today is structurally not set up yet for that to be a believable story. So we're going to need to do different things. We might need to open offices in a different location because this cost structure is never going to make any sense because I know we're going to need 400 engineers by this date and there's No way the growth is going to get there. Or we need our cost of acquisition to look like this. And you say, well, we know that selling a net new customer costs this much today versus a current customer costs this much today. Maybe I can believe a story that we improve either by 20% or 40%, but I can't believe improving it by 200%. So I got to sell more to current customers. Oh, geez, I got to sell more new products to current customers because it's cheaper. And you can like walk through those exercises from that. And that can start to paint a picture for I'm not going to have just a fantasy about 20% cash flow margin. I need to have actual tangible ways that I can see that coming to fruition. So I think that is one method I think where the framework can at least help you see where something is structurally broken. And it's a multi your journey to fix it. And I got to start now.
  Speaker 3
  What do you want Gladys to ultimately be?
  Speaker 1
  I think for Gladys to reach its full potential, what it will look like is still grounded in the original insight, which is that what companies need is a modern set of tools that help them Do HR processes that put employees first and sort of honor the fact that employees are the most important asset that the company has. And treating talent, you know, the same way that Salesforce treats the quality and clarity of insight that you get from the whole pipeline or what you get in finance with the finance Suites, where you can track things with incredibly meticulous detail.

    - **Note:** Plot tangible ways to grow your company. Having founder market fit with your company is important. They’re constantly seeing things going well and got levered long and bet on the future instead of being content or conservative. Divert resources to keep pushing. Time is vital to all software products and plant seeds early. Regrets around waiting and not attacking soon enough.
