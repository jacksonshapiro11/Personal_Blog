### Highlights

- Create your own luck by following your curiosity and intense interest. If you enjoy your work, you'll likely get better results and this will be magnified. If you don’t love it someone will work 10x harder and crush you. Importance of good role models. Envy runs the world. You can learn a lot by just monitoring an industry. Warren and Charlie saw google through gieco. Understood the value of the ads. Also looking for so many companies gave them the perspective on what was good and bad. The world is unfocused in short term so success requires you being the opposite. Partner with fanatics. There’s opportunity hiding in plain sight and you need to trust your judgment. Warren thought Geico was a great business, but all the insurance analyst told him it was it and he had to trust himself. Sam zemurry on bananas and Jerry jones was the 75th person pitched the cowboys. Build a business natural to you follow your unique differentiation. He would ask the top coal companies. Which competitor they would buy if they couldn’t buy their own in which they would sell short. Align company philosophy with your interests. Fortunes weren’t built with diversification.

  So I want to start out with Charlie Munger talking about the importance of creating your own luck by following your curiosity and your intense interest. And so Charlie says, Warren says he was lucky to find Geico, but not every 21-year was going to go down to Washington, D.C., start knocking on the doors of empty buildings to try to find Something out that he was curious about. So we also made our own luck by being curious and seeking wisdom. Buffett adds to this, if you enjoy what you're doing, you are likely to get a better result than if you go to work with your teeth clenched every morning. My favorite, they say variations of the same ideas. Obviously, they repeat the importance of repetition is persuasive. But my favorite way that they ever said this is Munger said, intense interest in any subject is indispensable if you're going to excel in it. In fact, there's a great quote from this guy named Naval Ravikant that really echoes a lot of Buffett and Munger's ideas, what they're saying about here. And especially in the age of infinite leverage, how important, I think that idea only becomes more important. It's definitely something I'm betting my life and career on. But Naval said, if you're not 100% into it, somebody else who is 100% into it will outperform you. And they won't just outperform you by a little ([Time 0:05:29](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5112886d-1f49-4bdb-8ee3-36c193809afe))
- Refine your decision-making by using opportunity costs as a filter, constantly comparing options. You have a finite amount of capital and time to invest in your best ideas. You need to context too if you never watch the baseball game you never know if a 300 hitter is a good hitter or not. Reads history to gain perspective. A lot of value in seeing how people did it in the past. Biggest mistakes are selling too early and not buying the mistakes of omission. Don’t chase opportunities and use too much leverage keep cash for opportunities. Buffet is upfront and easy to interface with. He sticks his evaluations and doesn’t let others influence him. Runs his business very simply and is upfront about how he does it. He focuses on his biggest problems first and the good things take care of themselves. You can never overpay for talent.

  But always in your mind, you are prioritizing and selecting in some manner. My own feeling about the best way to apply that is to just read everything in sight. Again, so they have this historical business knowledge in their head. The way I would put it, I love this, is Charlie Munger's description. He's 95 when he says what I'm about to read to you. And this is Charlie Munger on Lee Lu. And Munger says, Lee Lu is not normal. He is the Chinese Warren Buffett. He is very talented. In 95 years, I have given Munger family money to an outsider to run once, once in 95 years. And that is Lee Lu. And he has hit it out of the park. It is pretty picky. But once I have Lee Lou, if I'm comparing to him, remember using opportunity cost as a filter, who else am I gonna pick? By the way, that is a good way to make decisions and that is what we do. If we've got one thing we can do more of, we are not interested in anything that is not better than that. That simplifies life a great deal. And so one way to refine your ability to make decisions through opportunity costs, they're constantly talking about the importance and the value of reading history. If you never watched a baseball game and you've never seen a statistic on it, you wouldn't know whether a 300 hitter was a good hitter or not. You have to have some kind of mosaic that you're thinking is implanted against. You'll have a pretty good idea of what happened ([Time 0:28:22](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b48264f9-5b0a-41ab-8c8f-0d4525d02fc3))
- Advertising as a cost of production and should not be cut during bad times. Most CEOs are average. Top talent is tough to find so hold onto it and pay for it. Don’t try to force someone to be someone they’re not. Keep cash for a rainy day to avoid losses. They are individual opportunity they driven. They started with the textile mill and just went decision by decision to success. They cultivated a brand to where people would reach out to sell to them only. Maximize time working on the business and 0% on overhead that isn’t important to the customer. Hit fat pitches and stick within your circle of competence. Keep your unique differentiation and your advantage compounds over time. We want to do what we’re good at dinner caught playing someone else’s game. Learning is behavior change. Buffet and munger weren’t tech investors but when they saw the internet they sold their newspapers realizing their business was crushed. Stay in the game long enough to ride the wave of technology. Coke benefited from refrigeration. Standard oil benefited from the invention of the car. Baseball players benefited from the tv. Ride the way. Avoid bloat companies die more from indigestion than starvation.

  And again, the importance of this is like you can really see in the behavior, the fact that most businesses are actually poorly run. And even you would think they talk about in this example, that even the variance, like think about the Fortune 500 CEOs, the variance of performance, even in that subset, right? There's an enormous difference, frankly, in the talent of American business managers. The CEOs of the Fortune 500 are not selected like the members ([Time 0:42:22](https://share.snipd.com/snip/acf6ab1c-7580-4e2c-b5f9-90fda48445b1))
- Sam Zell learned from Jay Pritzker to identify the single most important variable in a deal. The stock price may change but focus on if Coke sold more bottles every year. The solution to problem isn’t more people. Don’t clutter your mind focus on the most important thing. Ideal assets is a royalty business where you liscense your brand. Need to ignore everything that doesn’t matter focus on what does. Sees candies taught him the power of brand. This led to them spending a ton of advertising at geico. A brand is a promise. Find people with intense customer loyalty. Pick an extreme example and try to understand what led them to be successful. Study the outliers of sucesss.

  And he's like, okay, here's like a list of eight things or seven things that we need to worry about. And Prince was like, bullshit. It's like, that's the one thing. There's only one variable. And if you solve for that variable, the deal will work out. And so they're talking about, you know, if you went back in 1919, you could have bought a share of Coca-Cola for 40 bucks. And in between that bunch of times, it dropped by 50%. ([Time 1:09:24](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2536bd0a-011d-4930-b6c3-a903f74c364e))
