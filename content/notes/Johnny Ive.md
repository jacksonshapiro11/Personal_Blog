### Highlights

- Keeping things simple is the ultimate design. Reduce so it’s easier to build a use.
  His dad was constantly asking questions and making his son think. His dad was a teacher and ended up reforming the creative arts program in schools. Johnny took this and it jolted him to be a designer but he was always interested in how things work taking them apart and putting them back together. Dad had quiet strength and relentlessly good at his job. His relationship was a source of inspiration. Admired him as a craftsman.
  Focused on a few good ideas and made something yourself and the care you put into the product. Dad advocated risk taking as at the beginning because you aren’t all knowing
  His dad was a big fan of drawing and testing.

    - **Note:** Simplicity and design risk tanking, especially early on, and the learning from mentors. The story of the father is imbedded in the son. Itteration and testing.
- Take chances Pursue a passion respect the work - he took big chances and if they had focused group the work it would’ve failed. But in England it was more building a team around your passion not training for a work culture.
  Love what you’re doing and do it with ruthless focus.
  His design ethos is about human interaction with the device and starts with how the design can be more human first. You can make something look like magic by doing more work. Some people would build 12 prototypes Johnny would build 100. Hard work and focus and passion.
  The mac was the first time he had a human experience with a computer and immediately wanted to work for Apple.

    - **Note:** Johnny came to design from a level of respect for the work and commitment and deep focus for the craft. He got shots up and learned through them with ruthless focus
      He was interested in human computer symbiosis design thinking and interaction not just how it looks but how it's used. Make great and beautiful products
- Don’t focus on price focus on value. Johnny left his firm because they wouldn’t pay him despite his being step change better than others so he left. Pay peanuts and get monkeys. He quits rwg at 23 because he wasn’t being compensated right.
  Always thought of how something should be.
  Had a small design firm with cofounders and they worked ran it conservatively but it could’ve easily gone wrong when you have competing views involved. Eventually he leaves because he just wants to design no admin work.
  He liked Apple because they were values focused while others just wanted a product to sell and didn’t care missionaries more mercenaries. Realized what he was interested and good at and focused all about that. He has a chance to stay at tangerine vs go to Apple. This is a turning point of his life and he made the choice by reckless faith. The few moments in your life that define it.

    - **Note:** Johnny was underpaid as a youth and left you need to pay for quality. Path dependence of life it took time for him to figure out what he wanted and the Apple opportunity was a bit of a leap of faith but he started his own thing realized he wanted to design great products not admin bs and became a missionary. Understand what others want who they are and move from there.
- First thought about how the humans interact with the product then builds it. Ferocious intensity of his work and almost left because it was becoming too beauracratic and slow. He wanted to go fast. You’re going to lose good people if you don’t go fast. Amazon was consensus and committee driven. It moved too slow and you need to go fast to be great. There is no speed limit. Wants to create something for everyone so you end up creating nothing. Customer not competitor obsession is what drives good companies. Johnny wanted to leave from this but was convinced to stay given jobs was product focused. Steve said the goal is to make great products which is why Johnny stayed
  Narrow your focus but raise your intensity.
  It’s very easy to be different but very difficult to be better.

    - **Note:** Tough to be non consensus and right.
      Raise your intensity narrow your focus.
      There is no speed limit don’t go slow.
      Build for your customers and an audience you can’t please everyone. When you create something for everyone you really build for no one.
- Steve had an intense clarity of thought and was a master communicator.
  Steve wanted to build the business he wanted to compete how he wanted to compete. He didn’t want to be another computer manufacturer but a high end premium one. Focus on selling the best products not the most products then size comes.
  Steve fired all the non a players.
  Johnny consolidated the model shop into the machine shop. So the model and design guys would be connected Elon did this at SpaceX with the machine shop and engineers.
  Critics hated the mac and tried to shoot it down Steve put on the blinders and focused. He went direct to the consumer who loved it.
  Apples worked very fast. Professional pride. Steve wanted to know if people gave a shit or not. Fanatical care beyond the obvious stuff
  Johnny takes extreme ownership for screw ups. He’ll take personal ownership for team failures even if they weren’t his fault and the team loved him for it.
  Steve told the makers of glass to get their mind around making it despite it never being done.
  Nearly threw away the iPhone
  What is your product better than. Notebooks are better than nothing.
  Find want you love doing and practice it.

    - **Note:** Steve had a deep clarity in building products and was a master communicator. He focused on unique differentiation he didn’t want to just make computers like everyone else he wanted to make beautiful machines that delighted his customers. He fired all non a players.
      He consolidated the engineers and designers to have them work hand to hand tightening feedback loops bringing a diversity of opinion.
      Steve had this reality distortion field where he shut off the world to hear what mattered he ignored critics but listened to customers. When engineers told him something was impossible he rejected it and told them to do it. Signal vs noise
      Johnny took ownership and passed credit people loved him great manager.
