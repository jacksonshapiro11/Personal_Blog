### Highlights

- Episode AI notes
  1. The key framework for efficient learning consists of four main steps: Deconstruct, Selection, Sequencing, and Stakes.
  2. Deconstruction involves breaking down the subject matter into constituent parts with expert guidance.
  3. Selection focuses on choosing key material and method to focus on.
  4. Sequencing is essential for learning in a logical order, emphasizing the importance of proper progression.
  5. Stakes add a compelling positive or negative consequence for hitting or missing the learning goal, which drives motivation and focus.
  6. The framework can be applied not only to learning a specific subject but also to meta-learning, teaching how to learn effectively by walking through the process, providing examples, and setting up projects for practical application.
  7. Leveraging tools like chat GPT can further enhance the learning process, enabling faster understanding and application of concepts. ([Time 0:00:00](https://share.snipd.com/episode-takeaways/46db865d-beca-4079-9ae6-2f51f11273a2))
- Efficient Learning Framework
  Summary:
  The key framework for efficient learning consists of four main steps: Deconstruct, Selection, Sequencing, and Stakes.
  Deconstruction involves breaking down the subject matter into constituent parts with expert guidance. Selection focuses on choosing key material and method to focus on.
  Sequencing is essential for learning in a logical order, emphasizing the importance of proper progression.
  Stakes add a compelling positive or negative consequence for hitting or missing the learning goal, which drives motivation and focus.
  This framework can be applied not only to learning a specific subject but also to meta-learning, teaching how to learn effectively by walking through the process, providing examples, and setting up projects for practical application. Leveraging tools like chat GPT can further enhance the learning process, enabling faster understanding and application of concepts.

  If you had to condense down that meta-learning chapter, what do you think the key framework is? I can explain it. I'm happy to explain it.
  Speaker 1
  I use it all the time for everything imaginable. The process is as follows. You can abbreviate the framework as D-I-S-S-S. The I is omitted. It's just to make a vowel in there. D is deconstruct. Then you have selection. Then you have sequencing. Then you have stakes. There are ways that all these can be used independently, but I like to use them in this sequence. Deconstruct simply means you're taking learn X, learn tennis, learn Japanese, learn archery, learn tango, whatever it is. You're breaking it down with the help of experts, hopefully, into some constituent parts. Then you have selection, let's just say, in the case of any of these things, you're doing an 80-20 analysis. If I could only choose 20% of each of these categories or 20% of the categories, and this is, let's just say, for the first month of practice, what should I focus on? Great. Talk to some experts, and you'll be able to figure that out. This is very important because selection, for instance, with vocabulary for languages, English has 300,000, 400,000. English has very high volume for words compared to many different languages. But if you take something like Japanese, I speak Japanese, Spanish, and a couple others, you can, with say, 1500 words be conversationally fluent and able to read most things in terms Of frequency of appearance. So you want to select your material first and then your method. The material beats method every time. So material over method is another principle. Put another way, what you do matters more than how you do it. I think that's something people would find most shocking about me if they were to observe me for a day. They'd be like, this guy gets nothing done in most days. But the things I get done tend to be very high leverage or a lead domino that knocks over other dominoes. So I choose the things I do very well. As for method, I'm often a sloppy mess, if I'm honest. Then sequencing, this is putting things in a logical order so that you are learning in the proper order. For instance, I didn't learn to swim until I was in my 30s. And I grew up on Long Island, keep in mind. I had a couple of near drowning experiences and I just swore off water, basically. And nothing worked. None of the coaching sessions, training sessions, teachers, I tried worked until I found something called total immersion and total immersion exemplifies this process brilliantly. Total immersion swimming basically has you practice hydrodynamic positions before you ever practice breathing or strokes. So you're kicking off the side of the pool in the shallow end so you can just stand up experimenting with being like few sludge right position, few sludge left position, getting your Body in the proper position so that you're not wasting 90% of your energy trying to propel yourself on top of the water, all of which is wrong for most people. So the sequencing, putting things in a logical sequence is really, really key. And you can get expert help, you can experiment, you can try to do things out of order. If you want a competitive advantage, I've done that before. Selection, for instance, for purposes of tango, like I ended up setting a world record in tango and going to the world championships and stuff in 2004, 2005, because I looked at what Teachers were teaching, what they claimed was important. And then I reviewed competition footage and looked at sort of the characteristic techniques and patterns and so on of the dancers I thought I could emulate. And there was this huge discrepancy between what was being taught and what was actually being performed in competition. And so I just honed in on selecting certain things to emulate in teachers who had similar body. You would have been a good quant investor. You're basically describing good quants. Yeah. And so I had this handheld, this is the four smartphones. I would review and categorize all my footage at night. It was very involved. But that was with primarily deconstruction and selection in that tango example. Then the sequencing, logical sequence, a lot of folks who think that they're battle languages, you're not battling, it's just that you've never had someone do this, run the language Through these filters properly. Stakes, there must be a consequence, positive or negative for hitting your goal and not hitting your goal. And it needs to be really compelling. And if you do that, a lot of these other things fall in line.
  Speaker 2
  So if you've gotten good at this process, which is so interesting and compelling, what is the equivalent process of being so good at then repackaging and teaching it faster than you Learned it? Is it just a better appreciation of that same process and a better framing of that same process to others and a better Pareto understanding or something like that that helps you do that So effectively? Is it clever copy? Is it clever framing? What is it that unlocks such good teaching for yourself or others?
  Speaker 1
  Let's just assume I have a student in front of me. There are really two things I can teach. One is a given subject matter, tango, charcoal drawing, whatever it might be. I would use this process or the output of this process to teach them and then probably set up some stakes. And then the second thing I can teach, so there's the subject, or I can teach meta learning, learning how to learn, in which case I would walk them through this process and give them examples Just like I'm doing with you. And then I would have them test it. I would give them projects. I'd be like, okay, this week you're learning this, next week you're learning this, week after you're learning this. If you know how to apply this now, holy shit man with chat GPT, another tool zero disposal. Perplexity is really good.
  Speaker 2
  Have you tried that? Have you tried to say like, this is the way I like to learn, here's my method, give me the deconstruction, give me the parade of distribution of what matters. Have you tried using a systems to do this faster?
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, you have to get really good with the spell casting with prompts to make it conform to this because the machines aren't going to necessarily understand the terminologies I'm using Them. But I know people who have learned to code video edit in next to no time using just chat GPT. All of that is going to 10x in the next six months, and then the next six months.
