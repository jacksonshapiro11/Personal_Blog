### Highlights

- Raising canes was one simple idea taken very seriously. Deep focus on his business and perfecting it. Not worried about anything else. Meny hadn’t changed in 30 years. Figured out ways to optimize an interaction by 15 seconds but compound that and it makes a huge difference over thousands of stores. Todd did this as a business school project and failed. He didn’t follow the crowd. He did chicken and he did and better than anyone. He was a genius. Everyone wanted him to follow fads but his deeply understood the industry. At 23 no one would fund him but he believed so much in himself and eventually he got it off the ground. Super human level of determination. Everyone told him the plan sucked but he made money doing boilerman work and raised money from his bookie. He did deadliest catch in Alaska to make money. He lived in a tent on the tundra for a month eating ramen before he got the job. He did this to fund his company how bad do you want it. He was very passionate kept 90% equity and self funded hate people who sold out. Missionary.

  That's where the clip ended. And then he continues adding to this. He goes, so we even try to limit distracting things in the drive-thru so he does a lot of like charity work there's a lot of celebrities he has like reason canes has a cult-like following It's very much like in and out and i'm going to draw the analogy of in and out over and over again today because it's just like oh this is like harry snyder the founder of in and out is reincarnated And his name is todd graves and so there's this the show that he was doing that was helping restaurants with Snoop Dogg. And so he's like, oh, let's, let's advertise the show. We'll put it on the drive-thru. And so there's a picture of me and Snoop Dogg. He's like, wait a minute, that the problem was even putting that poster, people sit there for like an ([Time 0:07:20](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4f440007-dc77-4452-a174-7e9c61e68ffd))
- Todd Graves struggled to scale from one to two restaurants due to lack of management experience and long hours. He took a ton of risk. He wanted to make mistakes fast and fix them quickly. Fail fast. He had a creative way to finance the first 28 stores where he basically took money upfront knew he had to pay payroll and rent in the future and just worked like hell to cashflow to pay these. He was levered to the tits. He secured a loan of a subordinated note provided by someone else’s guarantee. Just made it happen basically. He took advantage of a crisis when others were slow. Katrina almost killed him but he rushed to open up early and was the only restaurant open for months. The his near death experience turned into a growth moon. The same happened during Covid. He learned the dangers of the leverage that almost killed him but he always took advantage of a crisis. He was able to act fast because he only answered to himself.

  You're going on on a Friday or Thursday or Saturday having a little drink. So the main business for Raising Cane's at the very beginning was that late night business. I think they'd stay open till like three in the morning and Todd wouldn't get out of there till like five in the morning. But he was talking about the hardest part of growing the business is not going from 700 to 800. It was going from one to two because he didn't know what he was doing and he didn't have any help. The hardest growth for me was from one store to two, the first restaurant to the second restaurant. I didn't do it the right way because I didn't have a lot of bench strength or management in my business. I lived at that restaurant. We were open seven days a week, most nights until 3 a.m. We had to stay open until after the bars closed. I would get out of there at 5 a.m. Then I would turn right around the next morning and do it all over again. I didn't really know how to develop other leaders. And so this is the time when they opened the second restaurant. That's when his partner's like, hey, I got to get out of here. And so the way that Todd describes this part is making a lot of mistakes. He's like, I was trying to build a plane while I was flying it. And his whole point, the advice that he gives to other entrepreneurs, like you're going to make a lot of mistakes. You've got to go in with the mindset that you're going to make a lot of mistakes and be okay with it. You want to make mistakes fast, but fix them even faster. And so, you know, this guy, he says he has a very high risk tolerance. I think it's been obvious so far for what you and I've talked about. And so he's got two, you know, they're starting to cashflow, but they have a lot of mistakes. It doesn't have a lot of talent, but there's a bunch of these like double drive-through burger joints in Louisiana that go out of business. And he's like, I got to take an opportunity ([Time 0:31:46](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4976fccc-a80e-47f3-bee8-80a1848d2a3a))
- Communicate appreciation to your team. He has the canes love department that helps him tell the people he works with how much he appreciates them. He learned from the wrong way of doing it with negative reinforcement and wants to keep his people as happy as possible. Respect the people he worked for. He would give them gift cards for taking out the trash made them feel loved. He views marketing in a unique way he’ll never franchise because he’s opposed with control but he opened a joint store with post Malone and paid with it out of his marketing budget. He also bought lottery tickets for all employees to share if they won out of marketing. Everything is personal to him. He believed god made him good at chicken fingers. What assets may be non financial that you’re not using.

  Another idea that Todd repeats over and over again, you have to make your people feel appreciated. He has this great line. He says, communicate the appreciation you have with your people and with them constantly. So he actually has an entire department dedicated to this. And he talks about this later, but he learned the right way to do something by seeing it done the wrong way first. So he says, in high school and college, I worked in all these restaurants. And they would yell at you and say, you're doing it wrong. Negative reinforcement doesn't work in my business. If you go through a Raising Cane, you're going to see a ([Time 0:42:13](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8457e19c-31c9-4161-900e-c958879d21f3))
- You should aim to find your "last business" quickly. Compound your knowledge as much as possible. Over time, businesses can grow in unexpected ways, as seen with Raising Cane's Times Square location outperforming initial expectations. Average store does 6mm that store does 22mm. He has total control and approved every location. Very focused. Go slow at the beginning to go fast. Extreme patience with extreme speed. He’s laser focused on making the best chicken fingers possible. Don’t be all things to all people. Just the best at what you do. Don’t listen to experts follow your guts. The wise people and experts always know the limitations but can’t dream and do anything of substance. Limit the details and make everything perfect. He is deeply in the details. Do what you love.

  The important part is just like, you should be in a rush to get to your last business because the longer that goes on, things grow in mysterious and unpredictable ways. And you see that over and over again. Now, I also thought it was interesting. There's an idea that really popped my mind. I've read every single thing I could find about Sam Walton. He's one of the founders I most admire. I think it was on the fourth podcast I made about him before I really clicked. This idea of go slow now so you can go faster later on. In one of the interviews, he's saying, hey, we're pushing over 600 locations after almost 25 years of business. I think that interview was three years ago. And so now they have over 800 years or 800 stores rather. And he goes, it blows me away. We're about to start cranking about 100 a year. So it seems like he's right on that trajectory that he said a few years ago. He talks about another thing I need to, before I get to the same Walton part, Todd says, I approve every site, every location, every one. Remember what Walt Disney, the advice that he gave to you and I, from the grave, if we lose the details, we lose everything. I bet you Todd, if I asked him, and if you know Todd Graves, please send him this episode because I'd love to meet him. I bet you if I asked him, did you agree with what Walt Disney's advice? If we lose the details, we lose everything. If we lose the details, we lose everything. So what's fascinating to me is, okay, took him 25 years to get to 600 locations. And in two years, three years, he had another 200. There's this book called Sam Walton, Richest Man in America. It's episode 354. This is when it clicked for me after reading about him multiple, multiple times. And again, I think it was the fourth episode I'd done on him. It's like, wait a minute, back up. Sam Walton, when he started a retail career, the first five years his retail career, he had one store. ([Time 0:52:28](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5e650f72-e8a4-4bfe-8810-20c763f0720a))
- **Fanatical Pursuit and Resilience**
  - Discover your purpose and pursue it relentlessly, even when faced with self-doubt.
  - Never give up, despite the inherent difficulties in entrepreneurship, from securing funding to finding the right location.
  - Be fanatical about your vision, as unwavering dedication is essential for achieving any meaningful goal.

  If you want to compete with me, that's fine. You better get up early in the morning and you better work late at night, man, because this is what we do. This is part of my DNA. This is a representation of my family. So you better come with all your guns if you're going to compete with Raising Cane's because this is my world. And so if he's speaking about his business like that, you know, the question, he gets this question over and over again. Sometimes it's from people interviewing. Sometimes people calling in. It's like, why did you never sell off part of the business after being offered billions? He goes, I didn't want private equity partners. I wanted to own and control it. I wanted to work hard for that vision because I know this is my purpose. This is one of my favorite lines too. When you create and do, you're never going to stop creating and doing because it's part of what you are. It's part of your DNA. And then again, he's always asked, what is your advice? You're one of the most successful people on the planet. You've done it your way. You know, you're still doing it. What is your advice to other entrepreneurs? And he says, why are you here? What is your purpose? You need to answer that honestly. I think sometimes it can be scary even to hear what the answer is. It can be a little scary because when you lock into something and you do it, it becomes your life's work. I'm so glad he said that because one of my favorite things, you're reminding me of what Kobe Bryant said. Kobe Bryant was giving a talk in front of a bunch of young people shortly before he died. And remember what Todd Graves just said. You got to answer that honestly, man. You can't lie to yourself. Really ask yourself, what is your purpose? Why are you here? And it's going to be a little scary because that means you're going to have to lock into that. That means you are foreclosing all the opportunities and you're making that your life's work. Very few humans ever do that. And so Kobe says the greatest fear we face is ourselves. It's not anything that's external. It's not anything that's superficial. I think the greatest fear you face is yourself because we all have dreams and it's very scary sometimes to accept that dream that you have and it's scarier still to say okay I want that. It's scary because you're afraid that if you put your heart and soul into it and you fail then how are you going to feel about yourself? So being fearless means putting yourself out there and going for it. No matter what, go for it. Not for anybody else, but for yourself. And I think it's a perfect lead-in to the final question, the final piece of advice that Todd Graves has for you and I. He's asked, what is one secret that you could leave us with? If you're committed, if you're really committed, then tell yourself you're not going to give up because I've seen so many entrepreneurs give up because it's so hard. It's so hard to get finance. It's so hard to get a location. It's so hard to do these things. So they give up. So never, ever give up and be fanatical. You've got to be fanatical. You've got to be fanatical about what you're doing. Nothing ever happens unless someone pursues a vision fanatically.
