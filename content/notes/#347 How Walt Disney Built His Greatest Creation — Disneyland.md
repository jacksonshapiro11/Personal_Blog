- Innovative Design of Disneyland
  Summary:
  The creation of Disneyland stemmed from Walt Disney's personal taste in physical form, leading to an unconventional design concept unlike any other amusement park at the time.
  Unlike most parks with multiple entrances close to parking lots, Disneyland featured a single entrance leading guests through a return of the century main street ending in a circular plaza. The design then divided into four thematic activity areas: the world of tomorrow, fantasy land, frontier land, and adventure land.
  This design approach differed greatly from competitors who aimed for maximum street visibility.

  Right now he's telling the story to recruit and empower the people that are going to help build him, build the park, right? But then he tells the story to get people excited to actually come to for not just employees and builders and planners, but actually customers and guests or as he calls them. And so this is the description where it's just very odd because it's unlike any other amusement park in existence at this point. It sounded strange, unlike anything you would expect in amusement park. At a time when most parks were planned as a grid with four side and access entrances. So he would go and part of his planning, would he go and talk to other amusement park owners? And you're like, you're single entrance ideas, the stupidest thing ever. People don't like to walk. You need to have multiple entrances close to parking lots. And so again, going back to that note, I met reference earlier, the creation of Disneyland was well Disney's personal taste in physical form. That's the way I think about it. So it says, most of them had these, you know, four side access Disney outlined a design concept of a single park, a single entrance into the park, rather. Once the guests entered, they'd pass their return of the century main street, which would end in a circular plaza or town square, the area would then feed off into four thematic activity Areas, the world of tomorrow, fantasy land, frontier land and adventure land. More things he did different than his competitors. Most amusement parks wanted all the street visibility they could get. ([Time 0:31:28](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fdcac66a-051f-4d41-8995-e99a013bacc9))
    - **Note:** Disney completely reshaped what a park is he optimized for the experience with multiple entrances focused on creating an experience and building in a way his competition didn’t. Rides that were unique rides subordinated to story. Roy understood Walt was creative and when he was focused you couldn’t change his mind. Roy let Walt have all the plaudits and handled the operational stuff and money stuff Walt couldn’t perfect pair and combo Roy didn’t need glory. Realized he couldn’t stop him so he had to help him. Disney spent 40 straight hours working on a drawing of the park over the weekend before going to raise money for the park through selling tv rights. Disney saw the importance of TV and wouldn’t even sell the rights when they were 2000 TVs in existence. Saw the future and this hurt a key relationship he had but he would’ve rather lost if. This ended up being what launched the company. This is what ended up funding the park. He let external technologies help his business. He didn’t look around he looked internally and built what he wanted. Took 35 years to find his purpose and used technology like the tv to finance and advertise for theme park and wasn’t afraid of making it all up on the fly.
- The Vision of Disney: Transforming Basic Needs into Attractions
  Summary:
  Walt Disney's unconventional approach to creating Disneyland focused on transforming basic needs of guests into attractions rather than conventional rides for revenue generation.
  He valued cleanliness and great landscape maintenance over economic concerns, considering the park more akin to a motion picture than an amusement park. Disney aimed to make every aspect of the park, not just shows and rides, part of an entertaining story, which was a novel concept at the time.

  Now think about that. They didn't call him customers. They didn't call him guests. They call them marks. Custom rides will never work. And besides, the public doesn't know the difference or care. Many of Disney's favorite projects made no sense at all. Things like the castle and the pirate ship are cute, but they aren't rides. So there's no economic reason to build them. There's too many things here that do not produce revenue. Walt screwy ideas about cleanliness and great landscape maintenance or economic suicide. He will lose his shirt by overspending on things that customers never really noticed. Tell your boss to save his money. Tell him to stick to what he knows and leave amusement business to people who know it. This did not frighten Walt Disney. Those guys who call a paying customer a mark couldn't grasp what he had in mind. And again, he trusted his own judgment. He trusted his own taste. He's not that what he's really trying to build. And he said this over and over again. It's much closer to a motion picture than it is amusement park. And so he realizes, well, there's a good place for me to recruit talent. And that is my studio. There's a layer because he set up a separate company. This is a WED separate from Walt Disney Studios. And so in designing Disneyland, we thought of the park as if it were a three-dimensional film. We wanted everything that guests experience, not only shows and rides to be an entertaining part of the story. This was a new idea. We took the most basic needs of guests and turned them into attractions. Disney, this is hilarious. ([Time 0:47:12](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5c82c714-0dc8-4e8d-baa2-499a756ced66))
    - **Note:** Didn’t like hiring externally, but training internally. Dox excited when amusement park owners told him it wouldn’t work because it was too clean. Didn’t have traditional Carne games couldnt extract money. This made him happy realized he was on the right track because all amusement parks were trash and he wanted something different. Relentlessly resourceful it cost $500 to buy a mature tree but instead they got trees from future freeway spots that were being destroyed for $25 and drive around LA looking for trees in yards and asking to buy them. This saved them ton. Only the founder can recruit and tell the story in an authentic way. Walt starred in the TV show, even though he hated TV and would drink before every show to calm his nerves. The founder has to pitch the business though. They had no process in building the park because no one had ever did it before it was just smart people coming together to do their best. No formal process just go getters.
- Enthusiasm is contagious Disney was incredibly enthusiastic. Recruited, and aircraft assembly manager who managed 65k people during the war and had him train. The employees he worked to first build the purpose around the park and day to day. Great companies create their own language. Disney had its own language. They had a deadline and this creates constraints that push people forward. Disney never allowed people to cut corners. Highest quality everywhere. Individually detail is nothing but they combine to a magical experience most of the details went unnoticed he made perfect gargoyles on top of the magic palace that no one would ever see made sure or straps were leather even if people didn’t see it mattered when you lose the detail you lose it all detail was the unique bit. Attention to detail saved him multiple times. ([Time 0:57:39](https://share.snipd.com/snip/cc2264be-bdfb-4eeb-831a-98699789fa9c))

    - **Note:** Enthusiasm is contagious. Built a system companies create their own language and created a clear purpose. Hired a players as the space was unclear and they just built emergently. Deadlines create constraints. Never cutting corners incredible attention to details deep dedication to the craft.

  And I think reading this book and especially this chapter is just that that constant reminder. And even a legend like Disney, like he goes to bed the night before they're opening and he's just sure that he's going to be at the center of the most public humiliation in show business History. He had become so anxious leading up to that point. He told his wife and daughter to stay home because it's like, Oh, there's no point coming. You're just going to see a gigantic failure. I'm ruined. He was having trouble sleeping. He just wasn't feeling good, but was fascinating is the day that it came the opening day, he put on a good front, even if he wasn't feeling good. Says the dark premonitions had lifted. And now he seemed to be completely at ease and enjoying this huge moment. And that huge moment is the opening, the simulcast live broadcast of the Disneyland show and the opening of Disneyland Park. This is crazy. The United States contained 169 million citizens on July 17 1955 and 90 million of them watched the show 54.2 percent of the population. And so Disney's going to host it. He's got a bunch of other people there like Ronald Reagan, the future governor of California. But what was fascinating is the guy, his friend, Art Link Linkletter, which one of the most famous talk show hosts that he took out when it was just orange gross and trying to tell him the Story that got like, I hate to tell my friend that he just lost it. But he asked, he's like, Hey, I need help. Like he need a series of people that can ad lib, good hosts, but I don't have any money to pay you. ([Time 1:07:06](https://share.snipd.com/snip/097a6890-5dbc-4d26-b92a-977bb5eed17e))
    - **Note:** The park had to open on a specific day because advertisements has been taken out a newspapers for months. The park wasn’t even near done maybe 80%. They resorted to spray painting, dead grass green. Disney also knew the park better than anyone so he suggested something the surveyor said it couldn’t be done and he said do it because he had taken the time to understood the tophotography better than anyone. You need to do what you can with what you have. 90mm of 170mm Americans watched the opening. He wanted control The cared about the brand and so licensed hotels in the area because he didn’t have the means to build them. There are so many things that went wrong with the opening companies are never perfect. The asphalt was too hot. People were meddling into it. One of the boats collapsed and people at the shore people had to pee in the bushes. Walt had to supply the bathrooms with toilet paper himself but it was the birth of his dream. Nothing is ever perfect or finished. Disney land just got initial terrible headlines, but Disneyland was an ever evolving thing and overtime improved and got people to become true believers. Eventually everyone came around. Saw recognized criticism and realized Disney was alive and enjoyed the constant process and improvement that was the park. He wanted to work on something alive and called the process plussing.
