### Highlights

- Doubt Fuels Determination
  Summary:
  Elon Musk faced skepticism when announcing his ambition to build a rocket company, but rather than deter him, the doubts and discouragement he encountered energized his resolve.
  Initial reactions included laughter and advice to abandon the idea for a more leisurely life. Friends attempted to dissuade him through various means, including sharing videos of rocket failures and cautionary tales of failed entrepreneurs.
  Despite these well-intentioned warnings, Musk's determination only strengthened as he remained focused on his goal.

  And so Elon starts building this network of allies. One of his allies is this guy named Mike Griffin. He, a few years later, will actually become NASA's administrator. And he helps Elon organize these meetings of these space enthusiasts, these engineers, these rocket scientists. And this is a description of one of these meetings. He walks in, Elon walks in and basically announces that he wants to start his own rocket company. And I remember a lot of chuckling and laughter, people saying things like, save your money, kid, and go sit on the beach. The kid was not amused. If anything, the doubts expressed at this meeting and by some of his confidants energized him more. And so Elon talks about the fact that it wasn't just the people in the meeting do this, but his friends, and they were well-intentioned friends, were trying to get him to not blow all his Money. Several friends had already tried to dissuade Elon from doing this. One friend created an hour-long video compilation of rocket failures and forced Elon to sit down and watch it. Another friend told Elon of all the entrepreneurs who had tried and failed. Elon said he talked my ear off and said I would lose all my money. ([Time 0:07:32](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fd2ef302-49b2-4644-a9fd-5e55f0ac32d3))
    - **Note:** Elon wanted to go to space and saw NASA had no plans the multi planetary and realized the incumbents like Boeing had, no talent and so despite knowing nothing, he started reading so at rocket manuals and did it himself. He had to. Was his response to the stagnating industry. be attracted smart people by giving them agency that they didn’t have at NASA. at Lockheed peoples jobs were to find and source of one bolt on a plane at SpaceX they could do anything. they did an interative approach instead of just having a design not a linear approach. Test and scale. Don’t revere experts and expertise just find what works. Elon interviewed the first 3k people personally. Critical hiring. People signed on, knowing that they would commit their life to this. he promised low pay long hours and glory if success like the pony express or Shackleton. Audacious goal allowed him to be successful. Talent went over experience, Elon recruited all the best people from the best schools because of the environment
- Empower Decisions, Inspire Innovation
  Summary:
  Empowering employees to bypass bureaucratic processes fosters rapid decision-making, leading to more iterations and accelerated learning.
  This approach enhances success and builds capability. Key to this is the ability to identify and motivate engineering talent, encouraging teams to tackle the most challenging problems and strive for excellence beyond their perceived limits.
  This mindset drives innovation, enabling transformative changes in aerospace by emphasizing speed and cost-efficiency.

  He empowered his people to do things that would have required committees and paperwork and reviews at other companies. At SpaceX, if they could convince the company's chief engineer, that's Elon, of something, they also earned the approval from the chief financial officer as they were one in the same. And this is something that comes up over and over again in the early days of SpaceX. The faster you can make your decisions, the more iterations you can do, the more iterations you can do, the more you're learning. The more you're learning, the more success and capability SpaceX has. And so there's just quote after quote after quote in the book of early SpaceX employees describing Elon this way. He always made the most difficult decisions. He did not put off problems. He tackled the hardest problems first. He had a vision of how aerospace could be done faster and for less money. It was Elon's ability to identify engineering talent and then motivate his employees to do extraordinary things. Elon had a knack for inspiring engineers to do things they believe just beyond their ability. And when they achieved the impossible to reach toward the next goal. ([Time 0:20:51](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6811afe7-2fde-4199-899c-f7ce9b11bc69))
    - **Note:** He always tackled the hardest problems first ask people to reach for ambitious goals, not running for problems, but embracing them. Super involved making the big decisions high risk tolerance. He didn’t wanna fail, but he was never afraid of it. Big companies become calcified and afraid of failure. Everyone just got things done no finger-pointing just doing things. You can drive away people by going slow go fast. They move fast when they bought a part they wouldn’t invoice 30 days later they would pay on the spot and so their orders always got prioritized. When one of his machine shops was going out of business, he bought them and in sourced everything.
- Embrace Risk, Seek Solutions
  Summary:
  Effective talent evaluation and active leadership are pivotal in achieving success.
  Leaders who are deeply involved simplify decision-making processes and maintain focus on the core vision. Embracing risk is essential; a healthy risk tolerance can set companies apart from others that become immobilized by fear of failure.
  Encouraging a culture where failure is considered an option fosters innovation.
  This involves asking questions that challenge limitations, prompting teams to think creatively about solutions rather than focusing on obstacles.
  Leaders should align their team’s goals with practical yet ambitious challenges, optimizing resource use even under constraints. Understanding the balance between time and money, and maintaining a sense of urgency, drives progress and enhances operational efficiency. Ultimately, speed and adaptability are crucial for success in innovative ventures, matching the entrepreneurial spirit with pragmatic resource management.

  This company has a lot of talent. Elon's primary capability is to evaluate people quickly and pick the right people. He is really good at that. And then he combines that skill with being super involved. Musk was there every step of the way. Having Elon there makes things a lot simpler because he is super involved. He makes those difficult decisions. When the time comes, he would step in and make those decisions. He always kept us focused on the vision. This is one of the things that Elon brought to SpaceX, risk tolerance. This is one of my favorite lines in the entire book talking about Elon's risk tolerance. He didn't want to fail, but he wasn't afraid of it. That is another contrast between SpaceX and the legacy aerospace companies. They become calcified. They're so terrified of taking any risk that could lead to potential failure. There's another great management technique that Elon would use in meetings related to this. Failure was an option at SpaceX, partly because the boss often asked of the impossible from his team. In meetings, Elon would ask his engineers to do something that on the face of it seemed absurd. When they protested that it was impossible, Elon would respond with a question designed to open their minds to the problem and potential solutions. He would ask, what would it take? This is something that Elon has in common with Henry Ford. He would talk about the fact that we already know the limitations. So if we're trying to do something that's never been done before, which both Henry Ford and Elon were doing in their careers, I don't need you to tell me the limitations. I need you to open your mind with potential solutions for this previously unsolved problem. There's a line in Henry Ford's autobiography. He talks about this. He says, that is the way with wise people. They are so wise and practical that they always know down to a dot just why something cannot be done. They always know the limitations. Henry Ford and Elon Musk wanted solutions, not limitations. And then if we go back to what else motivated these top tier talent to join SpaceX, there's a very talented German engineer that Elon was recruiting. And one of the reasons he wanted to to to join SpaceX because of the challenge of doing everything within constraints. And so he said what intrigued me was trying to build a rocket with 200 people instead of 20,000 to almost build it in a garage. Can I use a computer I can buy for five hundred dollars versus one I can buy for five million? It seemed to me that's what Elon wanted to do. And this was precisely what Elon wanted to do because they were spending his money. There's a great description about how Elon thought about the relationship between time and money and how to deploy resources in the early days of a company. And I found this in the Elon Musk biography written by Ashley Vance. It says Elon would always be at work on Sunday. And we had some chats where he laid out his philosophy, said Kevin Brogan, an early SpaceX employee. He would say that everything we did was a function of our burn rate and that we were burning through $100,000 per day. It was this very entrepreneurial Silicon Valley way of thinking that none of the aerospace engineers in Los Angeles were dialed into. Sometimes he wouldn't let you buy a part for $2,000 because he expected you to find it cheaper or invent something cheaper. Other times, he wouldn't flinch at renting a plane for $90,000 to get something to quaj, where they're shooting the rockets later on, because it saved an entire workday so it was worth It. He would place this urgency that he expected the revenue in 10 years to be $10 million a day and that every day we were slower to achieving our goals was a day of missing out on that money. And so another main theme, in addition to recruiting top talent, is if you're burning $100,000 a day, you obviously have to go very fast. So speed is another main theme throughout the entire book. ([Time 0:21:54](https://share.snipd.com/snip/854c2e2d-ed5f-44ed-bbcc-b35e722ee87f))
    - **Note:** Solutions never limitations. Challenge of constraints and incentive alignment. Going fast no bullshit. Just burning money and limiting burn. No job was beneath people.
- Speed Defines Success
  Summary:
  SpaceX exemplifies the importance of rapid response and agility in business operations.
  The company's prompt payment model contrasts starkly with industry norms, emphasizing the need for speed in procurement and manufacturing. By acquiring a machine shop to bring operations in-house, SpaceX significantly reduced manufacturing costs and improved communication between engineers and machinists, fostering a culture of respect and collaboration.
  Elon Musk's insistence on accountability reinforces the company's high standards for performance and integrity.
  Furthermore, SpaceX challenges traditional practices in aerospace engineering by advocating for optimization over complacency, ensuring all components are scrutinized and tailored to specific needs, thereby enhancing efficiency and competitiveness.
  Overall, the company’s ability to make swift, informed decisions is crucial in maintaining its innovative edge and operational success.

  And so he says, man, those guys would send me some of the wildest crap I'd ever seen. SpaceX also paid quickly. Within a day of receiving a purchase order from SpaceX, Regan would have a check. With other companies, he would finish a part, submit an invoice, and receive a check 30 days later. SpaceX wanted its parts fast. Regan got the message and began to prioritize their orders. He had never worked with a company that moved as quickly as SpaceX. And so this is when Elon's going to actually buy his machine shop and bring it in-house. And again, this is the speed. It's just this reoccurring theme that hopefully you've picked up on by now because it's repeated probably a hundred times in the book. One day in the fall of 2003, when they called and said they needed a particular part rushed over, Regan replied that he could not help. He and his business partner had fallen out and the only course was to shut the business down. SpaceX would have to get its parts from elsewhere. And so SpaceX realizes this would be disastrous. So Elon meets with them. They negotiate over an asking price. And 10 minutes later, they present him with a contract. It was Saturday, November 1st at 5 p.m. Elon wanted his new vice president of machining to start work that evening. So he winds up bringing six of their machinists in-house and all the machines. And this is why. By bringing it in-house, Elon cut much of his manufacturing costs in half. Now he could buy a chunk of aluminum and have people in his building work on it as if it were clay, producing a part on demand without the markup and delay of sending it to an outside machine Shop. And the lines of communication between SpaceX engineers and the manufacturing crew were wide open. Before, if I had a problem with one of my customers, I'd have to call the buyer. Then the buyer would have to call the engineer. And a week later, I might get a call back with an answer. At SpaceX, Regan sat in the cube farm. If the engineers did something he thought was dumb or would not work, he could tell them there was mutual respect. His relationship with Elon was simple. This is how he describes Elon. Elon cannot stand a liar and he hates a thief. And if you say you can do something, you better fucking do it. And here's the punchline of this entire story. SpaceX likes to operate on its own terms and its own timeline. And this next part does a great job of describing why this was so important to Elon. Elon taught his team to assess every part of the rocket with a discerning eye. For a given task, a typical aerospace company would just use whatever part has always been used. This saved engineers from the time-consuming, difficult work of qualifying a new part for spaceflight. But SpaceX's attitude was different. True, a product may already exist, but is it optimized for your solution? Is it from a good supplier? And what about their tier two or tier three suppliers? And if you need more of them faster, will they meet your needs? If you want to change something, are they willing and able to change it? And if you improve that product, will they then sell it to your competitors? And let's go back to this reoccurring theme that Elon is capable of making decisions very fast. They're looking for a testing site unfettered by government control. ([Time 0:29:48](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4a756660-f219-4c4c-a247-01d6d2a859c9))
    - **Note:** Suppliers and sourcing.

  The company born with DNA that impelled it to go as fast as it could had run into an immovable force. And so the Air Force wouldn't help them, but the army would. So SpaceX's backup plan was to launch from this remote island in the Marshall Islands called the Kwajalein Atoll or Kwaj for short. This is one of the craziest parts in the book. They had just worked themselves to exhaustion building one launch site. Now they'd have to turn it around and build a second one. And this one is on a remote island in the Pacific. Listen to how much work and literally tons of supplies they'd have to ship to the middle of nowhere. They had so much to move. Unless an employee carried a key rocket part on a two-day, two-airplane journey from Los Angeles to Quaj, most cargo had to be shipped by sea on a month-long journey. At their headquarters in El Segundo, employees began to pack dozens of sea vans that would be stacked on large cargo ships for the voyage. Fresh from their experience building up Vandenberg, the SpaceX team knew they would need a lot of everything to assemble, test, and launch the Falcon 1. So they stuffed their tools and lifts and pipes and tubing and computers into 40-foot cargo containers and sent them to the port of Los Angeles. Over the course of three months, the company shipped 30 tons across the Pacific. They managed to build and test their first rocket. That one fails. What was interesting is on the flight back to United States, there's somebody on the plane with Elon and he's describing what Elon was doing. Elon spent much of the flight pouring over books written about early rocket scientists and their efforts. Elon seemed intent to understand the mistakes they had made and learn from them. And what he does next is a really smart move. He was placing the difficulty of what him and his team are trying to do in a historical perspective. Keep in mind, by this time, they've been toiling away nearly seven days a week, almost hours of the day for years, trying to build a rocket that'll get into orbit. This is what Elon does. Elon seemed to recognize the emotional toll that the failure might inflict on some of his engineers. Not long after the accident, he typed up an uplifting memo to the SpaceX team. As part of his note, Elon offered some comforting perspective. Other iconic rockets, he noted, had failed often during early test launches. And so he starts listing ones in Europe and the Russians and the American program. And he said, having experienced firsthand how hard it is to reach orbit, I have a lot of respect for those that persevered to produce the vehicles that are mainstays of space launches Today. SpaceX is in this for the long haul, and come hell or high water, we're going to make it work. And so what's fascinating about this part of the book is he's got two problems he's got to solve simultaneously. He's got to figure out how to develop a rocket that can reach orbit. And he's got to secure contracts so SpaceX doesn't run out of money. And so at this point, he's having a conversation with Gwynne Shotwell. And this is before she joins the company. And she has a lot of industry experience. So she mentions to Elon in a meeting that you need to hire someone to sell the rocket full time. That at that point, Elon just had a part-time sales consultant. And she's like, listen, that's not going to work. So it says later that afternoon, Elon decided that he should indeed hire someone full time. He created a vice president of sales position and encouraged Shotwell to apply. And so she talks about the fact that she had to think about this for a while because she said she was almost 40 years old. She was in the middle of a divorce and she had two young children to care for. She says it was a huge risk and I almost decided not to go. But her final decision came down to a simple calculation. Look, I'm in this business. And do I want this business to continue the way it is? Or do I want to go in the direction that Elon wants to take it? This is so important. She's going to secure the two contracts that save SpaceX. This is a very important part in the early days of SpaceX. Musk needed a partner who possessed his brashness but also understood the political terrain and had the sophistication to navigate it. This is where Shotwell would come in. The idea of selling Elon Musk's unproven rocket and working for someone regarded as a demanding did not faze her. I knew the business by then. I would be selling to my old compatriots. Of course I could sell rockets. No question at all. That is such an important point and it's such a great idea. Who knows your customers? Who are you trying to sell to? Who knows your customers? Find the person that knows your customers, then hire that person to sell your product to them. That's exactly what Elon did. If you're reading through the lines here, it's exactly what Elon did when he hired Shotwell. From the beginning, Shotwell understood the complex and evolving relationship between the Air Force, NASA, and private industry. Elon was still learning about his new federal customers. And then this is one of my favorite lines, our favorite stories in the book, because you just realize that Elon's very easy to interface with. No work about work, just work. That's the way he wants to do things. Shotwell wrote a plan of action for sales. Elon took one look at it and told her he did not care about plans. Just get on with the job. And then Shotwell's response was perfect. She's like, oh, this is refreshing. I don't have to write up a damn plan. Here was her first real taste of Elon's management style. Do not talk about doing things. ([Time 0:37:16](https://share.snipd.com/snip/523c550e-ba2b-41ee-8500-cfbecf18c70b))
    - **Note:** Elon builds a whole lunch site in Texas and the government tell him he can go, but he realizes they’re gonna be too slow and so He hast to look for other options and he goes to the army and then they have to rebuild the launch site in the middle of the Pacific and 30 tons across the water. They get ready for the launch and it does not go well. Then spend the flight home reading about all massive failures, and writes an uplifting memo. He meets Gwen Shotwell and realizes that he needs to develop the commercial side to make money to stay alive and hires her as an industry expert. Is easy to interface with and hires the perfect person. She wrote a plan. Elon told her that there was no plans she just had to do. Man style do not talk about doing things just do things. Everyone told Elon it wasn’t gonna work and this fueled him. He realized he had to prove his talent he couldn’t just say he would he had to be that guy.
- Fight for Fairness Sparks Innovation
  Summary:
  Protests and strategic lawsuits by SpaceX against industry giants and governmental decisions have proven crucial for its success.
  Despite initial resistance and the high likelihood of losing, pushing back against a NASA contract led to significant changes, including opening competition for cargo delivery and establishing the Commercial Orbital Transportation Service (COTS). This fight was pivotal, as it set the stage for SpaceX to win lucrative contracts worth hundreds of millions, demonstrating how decisive action can shift market dynamics.
  SpaceX's disruption of the U.S. launch industry, which saw its share of global commercial launch revenues rise dramatically from near zero in 2005 to 54% in 2023, exemplifies the power of challenging the status quo.
  Furthermore, SpaceX's aggressive pricing strategy reinforced its competitive advantage, underscoring the importance of visibility and transparency in a marketplace.
  The company's willingness to face legal and market battles not only solidified its position but also allowed it to redefine the economics of space launches, ultimately transforming the aerospace landscape.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And so Elon describes his thinking and why he did this. I was told by many people that we should not protest. You've got a 90 percent chance that you're going to lose. You're going to make a potential customer angry. I'm like, it seems like right is on our side here. It seems like this bid should go out for competition. And if we don't fight this, then I think we're doomed. Our chances of success are dramatically lowered. NASA being one of the biggest customers of space launch would be cut off from us. I had to protest. And the result was they won. The company won. SpaceX won. After NASA learned that the U.S. Government Accountability Office would rule in favor of SpaceX on the issue of fairness, NASA pulled the award from Kistler. NASA realized it would need to open up a new competition for cargo delivery. This became the foundation for NASA's Commercial Orbital Transportation Service, also known as COTS. This was important because the COTS contract, two years later, SpaceX wins that contract. The Kistler protest was just one of many battles that Elon and Shotwell would fight before government committees and in courtrooms. This is nuts. A year later, SpaceX scrapped with three of the titans of the U.S. Launch industry. In one battle, SpaceX and Northrop Gunran traded lawsuits over Tom Mueller and his rocket engine technology. Tom was the first employee of SpaceX and the designer of the Merlin rocket engine. And in another more consequential battle, SpaceX sued Boeing and Lockheed Martin over plans to merge their launch businesses into a single rocket company called United Launch Alliance. And SpaceX's point was that neither company's new rockets could compete on price with rivals in Russia and Europe for commercial satellite launches. So when this is happening, this is 2005, the US share of global market for commercial launches, it's like shooting like large satellites for television and other communications into Space, fell near to zero. So when I got to that part of the book, I'm like, okay, in 2005, it's at zero. What is it now? And so it says in 2023, the U.S. Had a 54 percent share of global commercial launch revenues with SpaceX's Falcon 9 responsible for the bulk of these. That's nuts. The role that one company can play from near zero 20 years later to over half. So SpaceX's lawsuit said this was a violation of antitrust laws. They wound up losing that lawsuit. But this is the punchline. Within its first three years, SpaceX had sued three of its biggest rivals in the launch industry, gone against the Air Force with the proposed United Launch Alliance merger, and protested A NASA contract. Elon was not walking on eggshells on the way to orbit. He was breaking a lot of eggs. And he was right because at this time, it would cost between $26 and $28 million per launch. SpaceX winds up being able to do this for $6 million. He did something really smart too. Because his price was so good, Elon wanted the price front and center on the company's website. Needless to say, none of the competitors would say, hey, you would not find pricing on their websites. And so Elon's like, no, no, no. You go to SpaceX.com. You're going to say, hey, we can do this for $6 million. It's going to be on the front page. And all these protests and these lawsuits, they directly lead to the two contracts that change SpaceX forever. The first one in 2006 is going to be for $278 million. And then the one that saves the company after the fourth launch in 2008 is for $1.6 billion. But this is the first contract that changed SpaceX forever. ([Time 0:47:05](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d0b45419-9c87-4421-a5b2-24516f789b32))
    - **Note:** Elon realized he had to fight through the courts to even have a chance and so he bought everyone and US launch capacity went from 0% at 54% driven almost always by SpaceX. Always fighting changing the world. Clear on price. They got a stamp of approval from nasa. Employees respect him because he’s in the trenches doing what they did was incredibly hard. It wasn’t not done because people were lazy. It wasn’t done because it was impossible. He hires young people and gives them extreme agencies to do whatever they want
- Perseverance Amidst Adversity
  Summary:
  Elon Musk faced significant challenges during the early years of SpaceX, particularly after a series of failures that left the company on the brink of collapse.
  With personal and financial stakes high, he rallied his team after the third failed rocket launch, choosing to focus on motivation rather than blame. Facing a critical deadline of eight weeks, Musk and his team displayed extraordinary resilience, managing to rebuild and launch their rocket in record time despite overwhelming odds.
  This phase not only solidified SpaceX’s foundational culture but positioned it as a transformative force in aerospace.
  Concurrently, Musk's personal life and finances were deteriorating.
  With both SpaceX and Tesla nearing bankruptcy, he struggled to decide which company to save, likening the dilemma to choosing between two children. The eventual NASA contract win brought a much-needed lifeline, worth $1.6 billion, ensuring the survival of both companies. Musk's journey portrays the essence of perseverance amidst adversity, showcasing how relentless determination and quick adaptability can lead to redemption, even in dire situations.

  It's called Eight Weeks. When Elon starts SpaceX, he's like, okay, we got enough money. We're going to give it three attempts. After the third fail attempt, he's like, we're running out of money. We have one more shot on this, but we have to do this in eight weeks. And keep in mind when this is happening. So Elon's 30 when he found SpaceX. When this is happening, it is do or die time for his company. He is only 37 years old. And so this is how Elon responded to that third failure. After the third failure, Musk called a staff meeting. Musk chose not to play the blame game. Instead, he rallied the team with an inspiring speech. As bad as Flight 3 had gone, he wanted to give his people one final swing. Outside that room, in the factory, they had the parts for a final Falcon 1 rocket. Build it, he said, and then fly it. He collected everyone in the room and said, we have another rocket. Get your shit together and go back to the island and launch it. The period that followed would be the most memorable and arguably important period of the company's history, hardening its DNA and setting the stage for SpaceX to become the most transformative Aerospace company in the world. Now, keep in mind what is happening with Elon at the time, okay? Elon felt as crestfallen as the rest of his employees. Worse even, he had bet a lot on SpaceX in time and money and emotional toil with little return. Now, his personal fortune was running dry. He'd invested everything in SpaceX and Tesla. Beyond money, his personal life was falling apart. He and his first wife had split that summer. This is what Elon said. At the time, I had to allocate a lot of capital to Tesla and SolarCity, so I was out of money. We had three failures under our belt, so it was pretty hard to raise money. The recession was starting to hit. The Tesla financing round that we tried to raise that summer had failed. I got divorced. I didn't even have a house. My ex-wife had the house. It was a shitty summer. It was a hell of time to be running a single cash-hungry startup, let alone two. Musk really had put all of his net worth into rocket and electric car ventures, and in August 2008, he had almost nothing to show for it. His rocket company had produced a litany of failures, and Tesla was equally cash-strapped and only just beginning to sell its first product, the Roadster. And what a great summary of this. Elon had tried to change the world, and the world resisted. It's unbelievable how fast they put this rocket together. Okay. For the first time, what's even more unbelievable is they had to do it again the second time. So they are flying this giant rocket in a, I think it's a C-17. So there's giant military planes and the information they had on the C-17, like the pressure inside the C-17 was outdated. So as they're doing the descent into Hawaii, the rocket crumples. And so they get the rocket to Quaj and they call back to SpaceX headquarters in LA. They're like, oh, you know, the thing crumpled. We have to send this back and rebuild in LA. And so they're on the phone at this remote island. They're talking to headquarters, the headquarters in LA. And this is the response from headquarters. You need to stop talking and shut up and listen to what I'm about to tell you. You're not bringing that fucking rocket back. You're going to strip that fucking thing like a Chevy. And that rocket better be fucking disassembled by the time I get there Monday morning. There was dead silence on the other end of the phone as the sunk in. They were going to have to fix the rocket right there in the tropics. There was no time for quality control or meticulous records. They did not have six weeks. They had one. And they did it. They said after the fact, I cannot believe we disassembled an entire stage and reassembled an entire stage in the course of a week. I don't think we could have imagined that. And so they launch Flight 4 in record time and it works. The rocket gets to orbit. And yet even after that, SpaceX almost failed because they almost ran out of money. So it says after sinking six years and $100 million into SpaceX, Elon finally had a real rocket. When Flight 4 launched, the company's payroll exceeded 500 people, and SpaceX's finances remained dire. Tallulah Riley, which is Elon's girlfriend at the time, described Elon at this time. She said Elon looked like death itself and described him waking up from nightmares, screaming and in physical pain. Even as SpaceX achieved rocket success, both of Elon's major companies spiraled towards bankruptcy. That fall, friends urged Elon to save SpaceX or Tesla, warning that he could not support both. He agonized over the decision. It was like having two children, Elon said. I could not bring myself to let one of the companies die. And so this is when NASA had an open competition for this program called CRS, which is Commercial Resupply Services. And what NASA needed was they needed help keeping astronauts that are on the International Space Station fed and clothed. So if SpaceX wins the contract, they would fly food, water and supplies to the ISS. And so while this is happening, they're bidding on this contract. And it says still Musk fretted about how his company's desperate finances must look to NASA as his personal wealth dried up amid a recession. Finally, on a Monday morning, December 22nd, 2008, the answer came. They just called my cell phone out of the blue right before Christmas, Elon said. They were excited to tell Elon that SpaceX had won one of the two contracts. Musk couldn't believe it. He told them, I love NASA. You guys rock. After the call, Elon asked Shotwell to immediately sign whatever deal NASA offered. He harbored a fear that the space agency might take the contract back. Without the CRS contract, we would have gone down as the company that made it to orbit and then died. The contract was worth $1.6 billion. Two days later, on Christmas Eve at 6 p.m., Tesla closed a financing round that provided the Strap Automobile Company with six months of funding. At a stroke, his two seemingly doomed companies were saved. It felt like it had been taken out to the firing squad and blindfolded, Elon said. Then they fired the guns, which went click. No bullets came out. And then they let you free. Sure, it feels great, but you're pretty fucking nervous. It was a high drama situation. It's a great story, but it is way better in recollection than at the time. ([Time 0:53:59](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7826e760-2a05-4f2a-816c-22550eb47ec0))
    - **Note:** Elon is trying to change the world and the world is just pushing back. They fail a third time and they have eight weeks to give it their all Elon’s life isn’t right and he just has to make it happen. He had to save SpaceX Tesla. He couldn’t save both the agonized over the decision. He told the team after the rocket ball. They had one week to rebuild it, and they had to do it on the island. Elon went to hell and back rode through the valley of death and survived. Just amazing to do what he did.
