  In fact, that's a word that he's going to use over and over again. In addition to reading this book, there is this fantastic article in the Financial Times that I'll link down below as well, where Christopher Nolan gives you an insight into his mind. At the very end of the article, the interviewer is asking, like, okay, after Oppenheimer, like, what's your next film? And he says, I've never been any good at that. The only way I know how to work is to sort of burrow in on one project very obsessively. And so the word obsessed is in this book over and over again. I think the main idea, the reason I want to read this to you though, is because the idea behind what Christopher Nolan's about to tell us is like, if you're obsessed with what you're making, you can make other people obsessed with it too. And I love what he says here. He says, people will say to me that there are people online who are obsessed with inception or obsessed with Memento. They're asking me to comment on that, is if I thought it was weird or something. And I'm like, well, I was obsessed with it for years, genuinely obsessed with it. So it doesn't strike me as weird. We put a lot into these films. Every film, this is so good. Every film I do, I have to believe that I'm making the best film that's ever been made. Films are really hard to make. They are all consuming. So it had never occurred to me that there were people making films who weren't trying to make the best film that ever was. Why would you otherwise? That's a perfect insight into Nolan's mindset. ([Time 0:06:28](https://share.snipd.com/snip/30f2c810-de48-4d17-83b4-3f1799e4029f))
    - **Note:** Nolan is obsessed he fully pours himself into every film and project. You need to believe this is the best film you’ve ever made of you want to pour your life into it. If you don’t believe that why make it. He’s an obsessive. He shuts off technology so he can build a world of his own within his head. He doesn’t even have email he needs that free space to think. Nolan has a long memory and was already interested in movies. He wanted to build his own universe. He watches movies like practice and game tape. He had the idea of inception for 20 years. Nolan created his own curriculum in his college years. He also holds a very high level of discipline on his sets. He’s shaping and building his world. High agency person. He didn’t get into film school but was relentlessly resourceful working with his girlfriend and then wife spending as little as possible to have as much control as possible.
- Christopher Nolan's Journey as a Filmmaker
  Summary:
  Christopher Nolan, at the age of 27, completed his first film on a shoestring budget and strategically edited it for a simultaneous release to open up unforeseen opportunities.
  Anticipating the success of his first film, he already had the concept of 'Memento,' his second film, ready. Despite initial rejections from film school, Nolan remained focused on new creative ideas and developed a complex narrative structure for 'Memento,' which garnered critical acclaim.
  Nolan's ability to believe in his vision, adapt to challenges, and plan for future projects contributed to his success as a filmmaker.

  And so Christopher Nolan is going to get this first movie, this following movie, finished in 1987. He is 27. I want to bring this to your attention. This is what Christopher Nolan was doing at 27. He's got this film. It's created on like the shoestring budget. He's about to edit and release it at the same time, though. He does something smart. Like this is another example of doing the best you can with the job in front of you. And by doing so, like you can open up opportunities that you can't possibly predict. He had already known. He's like, OK, when this is done, if this is well received, I need to have another project because he doesn't want to work. He wants to work. Be a filmmaker full time, right? So it's like, let's say this comes out. I think it's good. I can convince other people it's good. Then what's going to happen is once it's good and it starts spread, like being come and critically acclaimed, maybe making a little bit of money, distributors and other movie series. I'm like, hey, do you have anything next? He already had the idea for Memento. This is his second film. This is the thing that that causes his critical vertical. Listen to this description of what he was doing at 27 years old. Rather than being discouraged by his rejection from film school, he was hot on a new idea for a movie. The story of a guy who loses his short term memory and tries to solve the murder of his wife by tattooing clues on his body, like little Mementos. It sounded complicated. Chris also wanted to tell the story backward. That was very important. He said, I couldn't quite see it. But when you're around someone who does, you start to believe it. And so they finished the following. It is extremely well received, gets written about in all the major papers in San Francisco and New York. And so then people would ask him, okay, what do you want to do next? Do you have another idea? ([Time 0:24:25](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7448a3f4-da2e-4847-a602-86e6012cdafa))
    - **Note:** Nolan made his first movie and was looking to ride the wave of his success. He already had the completed script for momento after he released it. He was 27 and always forward thinking. He releases it at 30 it changes his life. Stephen sodenberg personally went out on a limb to get his first studio production released offering to produce it himself. You need people like this who want to help because they like and respect you. He also had to learn how to work within the Hollywood system to be successful. It’s not the tools it’s the person. Nolan was using analog answers to complex questions where everyone else was using new tech. After the dark night he went from solid to unassailable he could do anything he wanted. When he finally got this he made inception. He takes cross disciplinary learning from all art.
- The Three-Dimensional Approach to Ideas and Storytelling
  Summary:
  The approach involves flipping an idea backwards to turn it into a three-dimensional object that can be physically interacted with, similar to how Henry Royce would create wooden models to bring his ideas to life.
  This technique is applied to both filmmaking by Christopher Nolan and car manufacturing by Henry Royce, emphasizing the importance of turning storytelling into a tangible, sculptural exercise. Through this process, ideas are transformed from abstract concepts into practical manifestations, enabling a deeper understanding and connection to the creative process.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And it's this idea of like, first you flip it. So when Christopher Nolan first has an idea, his first instinct is to flip the idea backwards, right? And then he'll write it out or he'll draw it out. And essentially he's like turning an idea into like a three dimensional object that he can actually hold in his hands. This is very similar to Henry Royce. Henry Royce would have an idea for some kind of thing he wants to prove on the cars that he's manufacturing. And so he would describe the idea and then he'd have a wooden model of like the part made. He wanted to hold it in his hands to touch it, to be able to turn that idea into this three dimensional object. And so you see these drawings and you see these diagrams that Christopher Nolan has throughout the book. And the way he talks about this is really unique idea where he's like, well, that's the way you storytelling. You take storytelling, right? And you turn it into a three dimensional exercise, like a sculpture. And so he's doing that with films and Henry Royce did that with parts that went in eventually went into Rolls Royce cars. It's the same idea in two different domains. I thought it was fascinating. And so as the author and Christopher Nolan are going through, so they work his way, they talk about it like his real life, then they go through every single movie he's ever made. He talks about the influences he had, why he made that decision, which I thought was fascinating. But this idea of, hey, I want to live in the real world and I don't want to be dependent upon all these technologies was something that comes up over and over again. There's a great metaphor. He talks about it. ([Time 0:38:29](https://share.snipd.com/snip/cee8cb30-907e-4b74-b2a8-fa4559abd5a5))
    - **Note:** Story telling like sculpture making it 3D. Didn’t want to be reliant on technology. There is a danger in dependence and it’s important to find your way without crutches. Tech is tools not dependence. You need to trust your instinct. A founder is the guardian of the company’s soul. He doesn’t care about weather he keeps filming no matter what. This is his mantra keep the show going no matter what happens. Ruthless methodology.

  I'm always shooting no matter what the weather is just keep going just keep going letting everybody in the crew and cast know that we're really serious about doing that no matter what The conditions are. So they're not looking out the window first thing and going oh well we won't we will or we will not shoot today. This doesn't just apply to weather but I think it's a great metaphor for his entire approach to getting the film made I'm going to keep going no matter what and I make sure that my team knows It. And then I think the starting and ending point where Christopher Nolan is the same it all comes back to his original obsession of cinema itself. The way he talks about movies is very similar to me is the way like I described the way Enzo Ferrari would describe his products is the way you would describe your lover. Christopher Nolan has a bit of that and this is an example directing is a job where you have to know a bit of everything. Jack of all trades and master of none. I know that I've never had the dedication or the talent to be a musician but I'm musically inclined and I know how to use that in my work. I could write a screenplay but I don't think I could write a novel. I can draw a picture but not well enough to be a storyboard artist. I'm a passionate fan of other filmmakers and a great believer in the job of directing. I think it's a great job. The thing that makes films completely unique is the combination of subjectivity the visceral experience with shared experience and empathy with the rest of the audience. It's a borderline mystical experience. Movies have this very, very unique mixture of the subjective and immersive but it is also shared. It doesn't happen with any other medium which is why it's fabulous and forever. ([Time 0:49:17](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ccab9e2f-d049-404c-b18e-beb0370b2bc9))
