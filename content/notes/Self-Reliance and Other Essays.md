### Highlights

- Circles - We are Just experimenters in this life. We shouldn’t listen to others no facts are sacred or profane. We must carve out the lives we want ourselves. We simply experiment don’t believe we have facts or anything of that nature. Endless seeker with no past at our back this movement requires deep stability in our souls. In nature everything is constantly new. Constant becoming makes every moment sacred. Nothing is bound to where it is to secure it against a higher love by oath or covenant. No truth is so sublime that we cannot disprove it tomorrow. People like to be settled but the world is constantly evolving and we must change with it. Life is a series of surprises. Truth is Devine and helpful but the secrets of our soul are hidden from us. How these will help us will be unclear. Cast away all our knowledge to grow. The great man is so much that events pass over him. He’s not looking at the past cheerful with what he has overcome but indifferent to all resolute always. True conquering is when that dark time fully disappears no longer weighs on our spirit. We aim to draw new circles in our lives to surpass ourselves. We want to forget ourselves. The way of life is by abondonment a man never rises so high as when he doesn’t realize where he is going.
- Circles - Everything looks permanent until its secret is known. That which build is greater than that which is built because it can topple what is built and the thought in the mind to build is the greatest good. Nature looks fixed, but it’s very circular and secular. Permenance is a word of degree. A man has core values which he shapes his thought out from and he can only grow by bringing a new core values to the center of the circle. Then those circles grow larger and larger your circle expands with the great force of your knowledge. Each thought expands your life. Our life has boundaries and great thoughts allow us to rush over the current boundaries of our lives. The heart refuses to be imprisoned. The man is never bound there are always new frontiers. Greater deeper understanding. Step by step we scale ourselves. We create the new which is hated by the old before it becomes accepted. Don’t resist there are no fixtures to men. There is always a residual unknown. Man always has a greater possibility when we seek it and venture into the unknown. we continue to transcend ourselves and we see this through the growth of our friends to become better men. The only sin in man is limitation. Men cease to interest us when we find their limitations. He’s actually talking about paradigm shifts here and how it changes the world. There are levels to idealism. The length of a conversation is a mark of how far apart the speakers are intellectually. The field cannot be seen well within the field. All the arguments and wisdoms aren’t in science or encyclopedias but sonnets. One man’s justice is another man’s injustice the world is circular. There is no virtues that are final. The virtues of society are the vices of the saint. We must cast away our virtues into the same place we’ve thrown our vices. Forgive his crimes and virtues.
- Prudence - We write from aspiration as we do from experience. Prudence is false when dettached and true when it reveals the natural history of the soul. Some people live to the symbol, wanting health or wealth in life. Poets and artist transcend the symbols. Wisemen live above the beauty of the symbol to the beauty of the things signified at an even higher level. First class have common sense second taste third class have spiritual perception. Sometimes a man can see at all 3 levels of these things and transcend them all. Culture degrades everything into means. True prudence admits the joy of the internal world, the transcendent one where the other one relies more externals. Prudence respects the laws of nature. We must find pleasure in the little things, not just great actions of men but lighting of fire in your house with firewood and taking joy in it. Happiness in small satisfactions. We see genius and a material form. Talent that is judged by money. Society values men who create and refine luxury not abolish it. We should value the latter but don’t. Prudence learns the law of nature, sows what he reels. Transcends. Prudence means the good man is the wise man is the politically just man is the strong man. All important qualities have an essential nature. Prudence isn’t rooted in flight, but confronting your biggest fears and being courageous. Don’t be hostile or bitter to those you even disagree with. All good virtues are on the side of prudence. If you can’t have friends on good terms you can’t have them.

    - **Note:** Prudence is embedded in your soul not detached. People live to ideals the path of life but others transcend those symbols and live a higher life. Above the symbol to the deeper meaning of spiritual perception. Culture degrades things into means. Prudence finds greatness in the big and little actions. Society values building and talent but not living internally at peace and being happy with what you have. Wisdom and justice a man who can face fears with courage. Not hostile or bitter but open and loving to all friend and doe.
- Shakespeare, or the Poet - No man is original the greats just have better range and live in unison with their countries and times. Right place and time indebted to those before them. We stand in the shoulders of giants and we don’t create our times but we’re receptive to it. Shakespeare stole much of his plays. Shakespeare had a deep understanding of human nature and drama. Shakespeare talks without bias transfers, the inmost nature of things into verse. He gave a perfect representation of everything. Has no egoism. He is cheerful and beauty as his aim he loves virtue, not for its obligation, but Grace. Sees the lovely light the sparkles from man.

    - **Note:** We stand on the shoulder of giants and most of the great creation of our times happen because we adapt the old to the new. We take the old ideas discovered and translate them into the verse of our times so they resonate. Shakespeare stole his plays and stole without mercy but did so well. Right time and place to capture the zeitgeist
- Nature - If the rich were as rich as the poor fancy riches. Hunting of the picturesque is inseparable from our protest against false society we have so much joy in nature because we have so many issues with man. When we viewed both equally we’d be indifferent in the respective company currently we feel relaxed in the nature and uneasy with man. Nature creates physics and psychology man bastardized it with metaphysics and fake science. Nature creates a greater world. Nature creates fear and we feel this fear in interpersonal relationships. No man is quite sane. Wisdom has other tongues than we. Unless we believed what we had to say was important we wouldn’t do it so we have ti believe this lie. Our work may be uselsss but we must not think this. We only do what we think is important and lie to ourselves sometimes. All promise outruns performance every end leads to just another end. Humans are encamped in nature. We have thirsts we need to quench but bread and wine only make us yearn for more. Hunger for wealth fools the pursuer. We think we need a big house to have a good life when a sidewalk bigger has a better conversation than we do. We first wanted to create opportunity but now we just want to remove friction we don’t want to be great we want life to be easy and we’ve become soft. We feel more magic for something we cannot have the lover we yearn for is no longer beautiful once she accepts us she wants more. Because we cannot understand nature fully it’s magical. We must feel nature flow through us.
- Gifts - True gifts is when the object desire is not wanted, but the full relationship and wealth is felt through the gift flowing onto you so that it’s a perfect representation of the relationship and an extension of that person not a material good. Gifts are on essential and gifts are in true companionship and love. Real gifts are asymmetric you cannot give a gift to a great person equal to the amazing values he bestows on you. Gifts are empty next to the love in true relationships. Majesty and love are the genius and god of gifts. No service are of any value. You can’t just do nice things and expect people to like you but when you love others they feel for you and are delighted by you always.
    - **Tags:** #gifts, #love-core-of-relationships, #relationship-(horizontal-vs-vertical), #love-for-others
    - **Note:** Gifts are not about the object, but when the relationship is fully felt through the expression of giving and what is given. The truest gifts are love and companionship. All good relationships transcend the material.
- Manners - Heroic dispositions are native in the true leaders of the world with a delight in beauty delight in society and power to embellish the passing day. High behavior is rare and not something you’re born into but discover. A beautiful form is better than a beautiful face and a beautiful behavior is better than a beautiful form it’s the finest of the fine arts. A man is a little thing in nature but can grow to posses the full power of nature. He’s arguing for full women’s rights but he’s asking for rights on Women’s terms not men’s. Women should be equal but craft the society they want for themselves not in man’s image. Only women can show us how they can be served. They’re their strength they show the power of goddesses and no longer need help but walk the world and dominate it themselves. Women are very strong. Success is relative the world looks like a giants castle to ambitious youth. The greatness is relative and the gates are opened with courage and bravery. Put yourself in the right environment for values. Everything that is fashion and courtesy humbles itself in front of honor. Rich is always relative. Without a rich heart bold love wealth is a lonely begger. True wealth, transcends money. Society and fashion has good and bad laws. Relative morality points to finish this essay.

    - **Note:** Good behavior is something learned and it transcends all physical traits. Men are very powerful and can dominate the world. Great take on women's rights that it makes sense not to form womens rights but to investigate a women's view of women's rights. Perspective taking from the customer. Women are very strong and powerful. Success is relative to being happy. Money is empty without love and happiness. Relative morality. Put yourself in the right position to be successful enviornment and positioning
- Manners - Personal force never goes out of style the competition may transfer from war to politics but the fight persists. Gentleman is a man first then gentile. The gentleman is good in every environment. He can out pray saints in a chapel out general veterans in the field and be courteous in the hall. These men take the lead and they can be as comfortable with statesman as in dive bars. The first point of courtesy is truth. Fashion is relative good sense. It hates sharp edges. Fashion is bullshit created by people who think they’re cultured but they’re actually nobodies who were given everything and have achieved nothing. Accuracy is essential to beauty and quick perceptions to politeness but not too quick. You can be too punctual. Leave the omniscience of business at the door when you come into the palace of beauty. Intellect is selfish and bearing the secret to success in life is a certain heartiness and sympathy. A man must always find happiness in the company. More spirit than whit from able men with more spirit than egotism. Contented and contenting. Whole souls. True friendship is the highest calling real men are willing to stand and die for it even if it doesn’t help them. Lord fox is a man who always paid debts on honor and his speech on friendship brought parliament to tears. Fashion has many classes and rules of admission. The people who constitute the natural aristocracy are not found in the actual aristocracy.
- Heroism - Heroism is doing something above all possible antagonism. It works against the common knowledge voice of man kind. It’s an obedience to a secret impulse. The wise man first rejects this act then accepts it. It runs counter to external good acting in contempt to it until the act is proven just and heroic. It seems crazy and wrong but then it seems brave. Self trust is the essence of heroism. Because it’s so non consensus and bold it must be. When you give time and love genuinely for a stranger not for show but for its good. God is in your debt. The heroic man scorns nice things like wine and lives with virtue. Heros don’t take life too seriously everything is lighthearted the rules of society are suggestions. They shape perception to their reality while from the outside they seem stoic inside they transform. Play your own play in innocent defiance of the world. A great man makes his climate great. The streets of Jersey to Washington were as regal as the roads of Rome to Socrates. There are men of words who demean everything don’t be these people when they get a chance they ruin and shrink from the situation. Heroism is persistent in all situations. Always do what you’re afraid to you. Adhere to your own act and congratulate yourself if you’ve done something strange or extravagant. Break the monotony of a decorous age. Generous with our dignity and money. Greatness doesn’t rely on others opinion but on the opinion we hold of ourselves. Speak the truth at all times. Human virtue demands martyrs.

    - **Note:** Heroism transcends requires deep self trust. A heroic act is first rejected by society, then comes to be accepted. It’s ahead of its time and brave. A hero makes his surroundings great. Heroism is a secret impulse that is non consensus and right and transcends society. Very brave act seems wrong in the moment. Hero's scorn nice things and lives with virtue. Geniune love for others with no though of reciprocity. Don't follow rules or take life too seriously and shape their own perception of reality. Rules = suggestions. Very generous speak the truth demands martyrs. Break monotony to get action and reject men of words.
      Hero's do what they believe trust themselves and do the hard thing that people don't believe in but turns out to be right like speaking out against hate when everyone else accepted it. Requires deep self trust. Do the right thing regardless of the consequences and don't take life to seriously when they do the thing. Transcend the world do what they believe create their own rules.
- Friendship - We overestimate our friends we think everything is better from their mouth. His goodness seems better than ours our thoughts seem truer from his mouth. Relationships are equal. Friendships shouldn’t be treated daintily but with rough courage. Good friendship is the roughest toughest thing we have. Can’t be broken easily. A friend allows you to drop all second thoughts and common courtesy we pay others in society. You are fully truthful and sincere with friends. We’re sincere with ourselves we need to be the same with ourselves than others. Good friends don’t need to be humored. Good friendship is alert and inventive. Creative in every way. Friendship isn’t a binding in a handshake but a bond of the soul not an alliance but an attachment. Friendship means there must be 2 before there can be one. Be the friend of your friends heart. Poetic pure and universal bond as great as nature itself Not talking politics or news deeper conversations. Friends are not property. We must be our own before we can be another. There cannot be peace between spirits until they stand by themselves resolutely. The only way to have a good friends is to be one.
- Self Reliance - Insist on yourself, never imitate. No great man to teach Shakespeare every great man is unique. Shakespeare will never be taught by anyone. Abide by your heart obey your heart. Society never advances. It goes forward on one side just to contract on the other. Great man are the same throughout all ages. A great genius returns to essential man. The old leaders die new ones must come. Don’t look away from yourself. Seek after yourself. Only when a man puts out all four and support and stands alone. Is he strong? A man who stands on his feet is stronger than one that stands on his head to use fortune to your advantage. Good External events raise your spirits. Tell you good days are ahead but nothing can bring you peace but yourself. Peace’s comes Through the triumph of your principles.

    - **Note:** Follow your heart and energy your unique differentiation. Great men are consistent through time trusting themselves and following their heart. Embracing who they are. Stand stable and resolute on your feet. Have a good foundation in life. Save yourself peace comes from living up to your principles
- Self Reliance - Society has chosen most of our lives like our religion our location, how we live. We are afraid of truth, fortune, death, and each other. We shun the battle of Faith, where strength is born. When we fail at first, we lose all heart. When a man fails in enterprise he’s ruined. When a genius isn’t successful on his first job, he’s a failure. He’s right to complain and disheartened. The good man tries all professions. The city dolls get disheartened after one failure, but the rugged man tries many things fails many times and eventually finds success. These men who try many many many things don’t postpone life, but live already. We can and must detach ourselves through self trust. We get new powers through self trust. When he acts by himself and toss his custom out of the window, he’s no longer pitted, but idolized. The teacher restores the life of man to splender. Prayer looks outside and asked for foreign aid, but aid must come from ourselves. Prayer that craves anything less than all good. That craves anything less than all good as vicious. Where is the contemplation of the facts of life from the highest point of view. Discontent is the want of self-reliance. The secret of Fortune is joy in our hands. For the self-help man, all doors are flung wide love reaches out for him because he doesn’t need it. Things are attracted to the self-reliant man. Like can break into any cabin only we try to find the means to society instead of looking for an end like in religion. he who travels to be amused travels away from himself. He carries ruins to ruins. Traveling as a fool paradise you need to reform yourself from within. Places are indifferent. We must bring our giant with us wherever we go. We cannot have a vagabond mind. We can’t garnish ourselves with foreign ornaments. We can’t look outside we must look inside.

    - **Note:** Society has chosen much of our lives, and we struggle for the painful battle of faith where we build our strength. We give up at the first failure. The city boy takes his first failure as his death where the rugged individual sees all failures as a path to success, and that life is made in the journey in between success and failure. Try many things don’t be disheartened by failure and in the end learn to trust yourself that’s true success. We hold in our hands all we need for success and we just need to believe and rely on ourselves. We cannot have a vagabond mind and look at work. We need to look inward and develop an internal strength and locus of control. People are attracted to the self-reliant man.
- Self Reliance - The centuries are conspirators against the soul. Time and space are physiological colors, but the soul is light. Man is timid unapologetic not upright. Man doesn’t say I think I am but quotes some saint. Doesn’t believe in himself. He’s a shame before himself. They are what they are there is no time for them. Roses don’t have a past or future just the perfect present. Every moment is its full expression of life. Its nature is satisfied and every moment, but man postpones his nature by lamenting the past or getting on his tiptoes to see the future, but never being present. We should live with nature in the present above time. If we see truly, we live truly, it’s as easy for the strong man to be strong as the weak man to be weak. When a man lives with god his voice is sweet. When God is near you and you have life in yourself it’s not by the way of another. You take the way from man. In our vision, there is no gratitude or joy. We realize all things go well and fit together in the universe. Life only avails not having lived. We resolve the all into the one. Self existence is the attribute of the supreme cause. Then makes it way Indy lower form. All things are made real by the virtue they contain. Power in nature is the essential measure of right. They are demonstrations of the Self sufficing and Self relying soul. Nothing survives in nature they can’t first help itself. Man doesn’t stand in awe of man man most go alone. We can assume the faults of others who sit around us we must live self reliant and ourselves. Don’t live up to the expectations of others. We must be ourselves and be loved for ourselves. We cannot compromise. We shouldn’t hide who we are. We should demand. We are loved for ourselves. What is deep is holy. We can’t live in lies. We must dwell in truth. Live up to our duties.

    - **Note:** The upright man needs to trust and believe in himself. We look to others when we should look inside and be present with ourselves in every moment fully expressing our life. Take satisfaction in yourself every moment. We postpone ourselves by living in the past or future and not being present in the short time we have. Live within our nature, our god. We realize there is a universal constancy in life that comes through alignment with yourself. You cannot life another's life but only your own. Even if you live it wrong there is more success in living it authentically than having not lived it. The virtue in our actions gives our life true color. Power is living aligned. Success comes when we live up to the expectations we set for ourselves. Love yourself dont hide who you are demand we are lived in a way unique to ourselves and when that happens we live our lives aligned and happy. We love ourselves
      Live up to our expectations trust ourselves believe in ourselves live your unique life. Live up to our expectations
- Self Reliance - We attach ourselves to communities of opinions like churches, and all of our truths become false. We live an un authentic life when we do this. The foolish face of praise when we answer and say things we don’t believe. The world whips you for non-conformity. We feel like we need to be consistent with past actions. A foolish consistency is the hob goblin of Little minds. Don’t just be consistent with your past but decide on every moment what to do. To be great is to be misunderstood but it’s hard to be misunderstood. Be honest with yourself. We pass for what we are character teaches above our wills. Our life id like a boat trip zigging and zagging through the ocean but when looked at from above is a clear line and chartered course. Virtue and vice are clear in our actions both overt and covert. The voyage of the best ship is one of constant course corrections. Honest and natural actions genuine actions explain themselves over time by regressing to the mean of who you are. Conformity appeals to nothing do right now. The force of character is cumulative. To right now. Honor is ancient virtue. We need to be ourselves over the long term character over the long term wins out. A true man is the center of things. Every true man transcends his age. We command the picture we draw of the world. The magnetism of original action is better understood when we understand how to trust ourselves. Who is the trustee of ourselves what is the source of our power that we call spontaneity or instinct that we find in ourselves? When we transcend analysis, we find a common origin when we keep looking, we find the ground truth. We lie in the lap of intelligence and receive its truth and wisdom. We let into the soul. Perception is fatal. Relationships of soul to devine spirit is incredibly pure.

    - **Note:** It’s difficult to maintain our individualism and keep the energy to be ourselves and not conform when the entire world wants us to conform and be something and put us in a box. Greatness is being misunderstood non-consensus and right. The world hurts us for not conforming. We need to honor ourselves by being true to ourselves. That is how we can transcend. Don’t be consistent with the past a foolish consistency is the hob goblin of little minds. Just understand in the moment who you want and what you wanna do and take action. Character in your actions are cumulative and build. Honest with yourself.
- Self Reliance - To believe what is true in your own heart is true in the heads of all men is likely a universal truth and the definition of conviction. We dismiss our thoughts because they’re ours but we should learn to listen to ourselves and recognize our internal power. Then we realize that our own thoughts are being echoed by sages and we’re no different than they are. In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts. We hear our thought from others and are forced to take our own thoughts from another. Envy is ignorance imitation is suicide. Nothing comes to us that we don’t take. We must till the fields of our minds. We don’t know our power until we’ve tried. We have express ourselves but are ashamed of our divine truth. God will not have his work made manifest by cowards. Happiness comes through hard work and authentic application. When we put our heart into our work we’re relieved and gay but what we do otherwise brings us no peace. We’re hopeless. Trust yourself. Don’t defer to society. We are the ones that must brave the path to the future. He thinks for himself and he acts with his consciousness and is unbribable. Society wants us to conform give up our agency not create problems so everyone else’s life is easier. Societies like customs. We need not to be swayed by goodness but ask ourselves if this act is actually good. Nothing is more sacred than the integrity of your own mind. He lives from within not inline wiry tradition. Good and bad just names we need to live sacred to our nature. The only right is within our constitution the only wrong is against it. We capitulate to badges and names more than us right. If mallace and vanity wear the code philanthropy is that OK? Truth is handsomer than love. You cannot donate to every charity and cause you need to focus on what’s important to you. Virtues are rare. There is a man and his virtues. People do good things like they pay fines it’s an act not who they are. We shouldn’t live for these spectacles but just live. There always someone telling us what to do. It’s easy to live to the worlds opinion and go with the crowd in society and easy to live with our own opinion in solitude but growth is living in society but by our own not the worlds opinion of us.

    - **Note:** We must have a deep sense of self trust. A lot of our original ideas are the ideas of the greatest men, but when we hear it in ourselves, we don’t believe it must have to hear it from someone else. Believe yourself don’t just discover through others. This should not be necessary. Human nature remains constant. We must trust ourselves and be courageous. We need to till our own minds and be brave. Hard work set us free. Society wants us to act in a certain way to conform to a certain being, but the real man follows his unique virtues and differentiation to live a life unique to him. He does not conform. Craft a personal philosophy to free ourselves. Inner moral compass.
- Compensation - We gain the strength of the temptation we resist. Men can only be cheated by himself. The better you act the more your good feels compound. The world’s opinion doesn’t matter. The martyr cannot be dishonored. The truth cleanses all. God isn’t a relation but the whole. Everything else falls around this. There is no excess to great things like love and beauty. Views the world through optimism. The soul refuses limits. A man’s life is a progress not a station. Material goods are taxed but internal ones only compound and are free. We only suffer through our own hand. The nature of man is growth. Every soul is constantly growing and has to change. These are frequent until a man becomes a transparent fluid member where the living form is seen vs a heterogeneous fabric of events. A great man is a transparent complex adaptive system not a series of disparate facts and structures. Integration not point connections. Power lies in the connections. Then there is the enlargement of man when he becomes a fully integrated person. Growth doesn’t come by gradual but by shocks. We grow to a person changed so much we don’t recognize the person we were yesterday. We resist growth we cannot let things go so growth must be shocked into us. We need to let the bad out to let the good in. We don’t think anything tomorrow could rival the good old days but we’re very wrong. There is always hope for the further that comes from our personal growth. We cannot rely on the new so we fixate too much on the old to our detriment we must anyways focus on growth. We look backwards wrongly. Loss seems painful like an unpayable debt but this is wrong. Death creates an opportunity to open you up to a greater dose of life. This allows things to die so new ideas and things can foster in its place. A small flower dies for a large tree to grow in its place and provide fruits to the world.
- Compensation - Arguing for the balanced duality of the universe. Everything has a balance weight. We gain power but lose time. Every sweet a sour every excess a defect. Every pleasure is balance with pain. For everything you miss you gain something and everything you gain you lose something. If the law is too strict the jury won’t convict. If too loose people seek vengeance themselves. The systems of the world are self correcting in all forms. Nature has one nature in different forms. A horse is a running man a bird a flying man ect. The universe is alive. Omnipresence means god appears in every moss and cobweb. Everything is magical. There is good an evil in everything. The balance of the universe is in everything. The dice of god are always loaded. The world is probabilistic. Everything has a balancing act. Men think that to be great they must posses one side of nature the sweet without the bitter. We think we can cut off what we could have from what we can’t have. There is always a mortal balance to things. Great writing themes flow out of the constitution of man not some defined form and resonate in some abstract way across all great literature. Proverbs across countries are similar which proves their truth. Infractions of equity in relationships are the beginning of problems. You must always pay your debt. There is no cheating in life the their steals from himself. Holding onto too much good is bad. You need to be generous with others and you’ll get good in return. You cannot get anything without first deserving it. If you don’t earn something you don’t truly have it. It’s not the real thing. The inverse is just as true. Love brings in more love. Trauma makes your life better when you see it well. While pride can injure defects can be useful. Love and the love you get back will be just as strong. Disasters allow us to benefit from them. Thank our faults. We should want to find our faults to improve them and thank the people who highlight them. Strength comes from weakness. We can only cheat ourselves. What doesn’t kill us makes us stronger.

    - **Note:** Everything in the universe strikes a great balance a greater golden mean in the universe. When things are out of balance they are fought to come into balance there is a deep universal truth in everything present in the balance of things. When you break this balance you hurt yourself more than anyone you cannot cheat life you will only cheat yourself. The only way to get anything money or love is to deserve them and we must grow through hardship that is the only way to be deeply successful
- The American Scholar - We need to be self reliant and think for ourselves. He must not be shaken by the pop guns of society. The charged topics that seem so vital at the moment but prove to always be passing fancies. Withdraw from the world. Investigate our soul reveal our nature. We discover the common nature of man this way. Because human nature is the same when we will look into out soul we see common humanity. We look into fear and conquer it and take its powerlessnes by looking through it by confront it. Fear is a creation of our mind we must conquer through internal bravery. Greatness is altering your state of mind to see more clearly. Always more to learn in the world by dominating your mind. The day is always a man’s who works in it with serenity and great aims. People gravitate people who dominate the arena of mind to hear bits of the truth about the psychology of common man. Most people have become like worker bees not transcendent members of the hive. Men resolve to be less to achieve their full nature but this is wrong and robs humans of their power. Oneness of the mind is common to man. We can read all we want and we’re reading about the common nature of man always but the true revolution is applying these ideas internally. All revolutions are learn to apply internally. Embrace the common to reveal the mystery’s of the universe. The near explains the far we understand the ancients through a better understanding of the present. No one can help you only you can save yourself. We transform when we are no longer a group of defined souls like north and south but a nation of individuals who empower ourselves.

    - **Note:** Human nature never changes so when we study the past or the future, we see a common thread always. We must think for ourselves and not be swayed by passing fancies. Truth over trend. All the topics that seem so important in the moment never prove to be so over time. We conquer fear by confronting it. We must withdraw from the world and find solace within ourselves. Fear is a figment of our imagination greatness is looking past fear. Find peace within yourself and be ambitious. Transcend ourselves don’t follow the path. When we don’t live up to our potential, we rob ourselves of our lives. A true revolution is within our minds. Reasoning by analogy.
- The American Scholar - One must be inventive to read well. Here, Emerson is talking about reading philosophy and how man is united and human nature never changes but says you must read science and the latest methods combined with a unified philosophy of life that you create yourself but can look to books to guide you when you’re on your journey. Need subject matter expertise that is always new and a deep understanding of human nature and philosophy that never changes. Colleges must not drill but create when they gather genius together then set their youth on fire to create and learn both internally and collectively. If college becomes more about the robes and degrees and less about knowledge the education system will have failed … which it has. Gowns cannot portray even the smallest whit. Colleges with receed in their public importance while they grow richer every year. What a great prediction. Action allows thought to ripen into truth. We must act we cannot just think and read. Blend men of words and actions. We need to be heroic. Scholar regrets actions passed by as a loss of power. Action is the raw material that molds the intellect. Experience converted into thought. The impermanence of life. Things leave our body and soar into the world. We learn how much someone has already lived by the poverty or splendor of their speech. Life lies behind us like a quarry where we get tiles and stones for the masonry of today. The final value of action is that it is a resource. When we have lost everything we still have the will to live. Character is higher than intellect. Thinking is the function living is the functionary. A great soul is strong to live and think. Living is a total act thinking is a partial act. A great soul is strong to live and think. To live our truth. The scholar losses no hour that the man lives. Man doesn’t sacrifice his opinion to popular judgement

    - **Note:** We must read the newest methods and apply the oldest philosophy. We should let the best of the past guide us. Colleges should spark intellectual curiosity not stamp everyone into one mold. Be a man of words and action. Experience takes your learnings and applies them to new situations. Living is a total act thinking is a partial act. We need to live and think our truth. The great man doesn't do what is popular but follows his unique differentiation with independent thinking. Living is being present with yourself
- Emerson Biography - Emerson principles were self-reliance, culture, intellectual, and moral independence, the divinity of nature man, the necessity of labor, and high ideals. Emerson kept a journal this was considered his savings bank that would come up in his writing later or became the center of his essays. There is one man split into particular men for society. There is not a farmer or statesman, but one unity of man. In the social state individuals take on specific roles, but these roles have gotten so subdivided people have lost their sense of what the common man is like. The connection of the common man is lost. The true scholar is the only true master. The common humanity and essential nature of man has been lost by all men. Most important influence on men is nature. There is never a beginning or end just a circular spirit. There is no beginning or end to the world. Learning first starts with understanding individual things in themselves, and then seeing the commonalities in 2 then 3 then 3k uniting the entire picture. Diminishing anomalies to see the entire system. Finding roots that connect knowledge under ground. We have always been trying to learn and understand facts but we must understand the deep simplicity in this complexity. Reduce it to the essential laws of the soul. Worship the soul. Nature and the soul are one and the same. We don’t understand much about nature and likewise do not understand most of the uncharted areas of my mind. The second most important is history learning the knowledge from others. Standing on the shoulder of giants reducing the part complex knowledge to more simple maximums and easily digestible parts. Men take the old ideas and express it in new prose. Humans need to exercise their creativity to express the past in their own worlds to own the ideas. The issue is these ideas become dogmas and people don’t respect the writer but worship the statue thinking the past has a divine nature not realizing everything before was created by humans identical to ourselves. We become book worms learn the past but they don’t think about it. The past isn’t something to be learned but something to inspire the future. Abused books are the worst because they take you out of your orbit and make you a satalite not a system. We have a free soviegn and active soul. Genuis looks to the future not the past man hopes Genuis creates. Genuis is the biggest threat to Genuis by its over influence which doesn’t allow the mind to create and run free. We cannot be subdued by other man’s influence. Books are vital to inform us but then we must go on and prosper. We hear so we may speak. Agency of man.

    - **Note:** Would keep a journal and write his thoughts in them. Saw the unity of man past the division. Universals vs particulars. Thinks humans through smaller sub divisions have lost the essence of humanity. This is due to men getting away from nature. The world is cyclical no end to beginning. Learning is bottom up learning particular then understanding the system. Root cause cannot understand facts but deep simplicity in complexity of reality essential nature. Must learn essential nature of mind and soul. Learn from history and stand on the shoulder of giants. Most ideas are rewritten old ones. We just express the past in the vernacular of today. Then this is built on to create creativity. Issue is people become dogmas and lose critical approach for justified true belief. Agency of man. Real genius looks to the future. Biggest threat to genius is losing the creativity. Past inspires the future. We must live our lives and not live under the influence of other men. Live your life and maintain independent thinking
