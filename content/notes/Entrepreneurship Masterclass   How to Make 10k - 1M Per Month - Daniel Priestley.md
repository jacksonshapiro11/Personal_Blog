### Highlights

- Establishing Yourself as a Key Person of Influence
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  So 10 K a month, 10 K to a hundred. At this point, I'm sure we've got to stay high level. But like, what's the, what's the philosophy here?
  Speaker 1
  The philosophy is you must establish yourself as key person of influence. People have to fall in love with you as a personal brand. So you've got to be this key person of influence. You need a team. Normally you're building up to about eight people at this stage and you have to have a front person. So this is because that's what gets cut through. That's what gets you from 10 grand a month to a hundred grand a month, having cut through. So the issue is, is that from 10 grand to a hundred grand a month, you can't really do one to one sales. You have to start engaging groups. Now you could engage group through ads. You could engage groups through affiliates or referrals or running events. Um, or, um, uh, one to many presentations on podcasts or something like that. But you've got to start going to groups to do groups. You need a front person. Um, so if we think about like, um, if we think about a consulting firm that takes off, it's because the head consultant is freaking amazing, right? In some way. Um, so this is where you are standing out as key person of influence. So if we look at, uh, Richard Branson, millions of followers, virgin only has like quarter of a million followers, quarter of a million to 400,000, uh, depending on which platform. Branson is like orders of magnitude more followed than virgin. He's been directing us to virgin for decades. We don't care. We like Branson. Um, Cristiano Ronaldo, 500 million followers on Instagram, every single football club combined less than 200 million. Now these are hundred year old institutions and one player has double the, the follow account. Um, if we, I was just into buy. They're like a big billboard saying we're opening a restaurant and it's going to be Gordon Ramsey and, um, Heston Blumenthal. And it's like all these like super chefs. Now they're not talking about the building. They're not talking about the food. They're not talking about the fit out. They're talking about their person, the key person of influence. You're going to book this restaurant because Gordon Ramsey. Um, so this is how humans work. We, we, we buy into people, people love people.
