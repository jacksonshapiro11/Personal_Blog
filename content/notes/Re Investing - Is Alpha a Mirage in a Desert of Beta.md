- Summary: The text discusses the concepts of Alpha and Beta in investing, highlighting the importance of distinguishing True Alpha from opportunistic Beta Hitchhiking. It emphasizes the challenges of achieving True Alpha over time and the author's preference for strategies focused on consistent, repeatable processes rather than chasing short-term gains through Beta Hitchhiking. The author shares insights on building moats against weaknesses, pursuing opportunities in less popular areas, and utilizing event-driven exit strategies to aim for "Alpha with Asymmetry."

### Highlights

- I mentioned earlier that one of the biggest challenges in Investing (especially for Beta Hitchhikers) is *knowing when to get off the Beta wave*. To me, knowing when to Exit an Investment is *much* harder than knowing when to get in, so I’ve put a lot of thought into **Exit Strategies** throughout my career.
  Having the right Exit Strategy is one of the biggest Investment Hacks to save me from my Emotional Self. It’s one of the reasons why I like Investments and Strategies that have EXPLICIT **Event-Driven** Exit Strategies. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7y4wsh2g9rdxsr3yqh22wxg))
