  Napoleon fought more battles than Alexander, Hannibal, and Julius Caesar combined. He is, beyond any doubt, the greatest of European soldiers. He never wrote his theories or principles on the conduct of war, although he often expressed the intention of doing so, and remarked that everyone would be surprised at how simple they Were. I want to interrupt this real quick, because when I read that part, everybody would be surprised at how simple they were. I thought about one of my favorite quotes I've ever read. And it says, a novice is easily spotted because they do too much. Too many ingredients, too many movements, too much explanation. A master uses the fewest motions required to fulfill their intention back to this book. It remained for Napoleon alone, among the great generals of his time, to seize all these possibilities ([Time 0:00:00](https://share.snipd.com/snip/46f955c6-da34-47bd-bd9b-e1c2afe5fcfe))
    - **Note:** Novice uses many tools does too much a master uses simplicity and goes direct as possible fewest movements possible. Speed and importance of speed. Compete on your terms he made people compete on his terms. You need 2 things great men and talent with big high minded plans then details in implementation that change over time. Campaigns should understand all possible avenues ahead of time and contain the ideas of countering those plans. Relies on intelligence of the commander capability of the troops and topography of the theater. Think before you act then burn the boats constantly go through thought exercises of different attack vectors and solve them. Dont just headstrong into a battle but once you do no mercy. Only play games where you have an edge. Dont do what your enemies want and keep morale high no one should believe more in your business than you. Small teams can’t beat large teams without the aid of art. Smarter companies must outthink large companies.

  So a small team, right? You don't want to go up against an army that has bigger numbers. And if you do, you can't do so without the aid of art. The way I think about what he's saying here is that smaller teams, smaller companies must be more clever and resourceful than larger ones. They just have to. You have to outthink them. One of the books I think was the Everything story. I read on Jeff Bezos. And at the time, Zappos is just selling shoes online but they're making a lot of progress against them. This is before Amazon buys them. And there's a great story in the book about this meeting that they're having inside of Amazon because Bezos realized that when they started making, like after all the terrorist attacks, They started making Americans take off their shoes and everything and put them at the airport. And that Zappos realized, oh, you're taking off your shoes, you're putting them in this like, you know, plastic bin. Can we see if we can buy advertising on that plastic bin? And Bezos saw that. I thought it was a great idea. And he was like pretty pissed off about it. He's like, they're out thinking us. And so Napoleon is you need the aid of art. When you occupy a position which the enemy threatens to surround, you should collect your forces quickly and menace him with an offensive movement. Default offense is the way I think about a lot of what Napoleon writes about. I love this quote. Nolan Bush knows the founder of Atari and Steve Jobs' mentor. ([Time 0:09:24](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a612a142-dafe-4ffb-9cab-9539c51098e9))
    - **Note:** Default aggressive. You can’t attack a well fortified position you must attack less numerous more vulnerable areas. Only one speed go. If you do everything you will win he believed one extra battalion could be the difference between victory and defeat so he left no stone unturned. All great events hang by a single the clever man takes advantage of everything neglects no possible edge the less clever man by rejecting one thing sometimes misses everything. Use deep historical knowledge to create leverage. Never underestimate enthusiasm first quality of a soldier constantly in enduring both fatigue and hardship by endurance we conquer excellence is the capacity to take pain. Nothing is more important than unity in command. One United purpose is bigger than 5. Energetic determination = true wisdom. Extradinary situation requires extraordinary resolution people conquered great tasks when their only other option. Was death.

  - Having a real mission and purpose is essential for a company's success
  - Energetic determination is key to achieving true wisdom

  He goes one, one army, a real army, united behind one leader with one purpose. Those five fingers go into a fist. The fist is stronger than the palm. One army, a real army, united behind one leader with one purpose. One founder led company with a real mission. One is bigger than five. For this next one, I don't have anything other than this is a great line. True wisdom. So far as a journal is concerned, consists in energetic determination. An extraordinary situation requires extraordinary resolution. How many things apparently impossible have nevertheless been performed by resolute men who had no alternative but death? And then he starts to identify some principles that he just sees repeatedly used throughout history by the greatest generals. He's going to talk about the importance of learning from the best people and the great people who live before you over and over and over again. In fact, in the mind of Napoleon, that book he talks about. If he was designing an education system for his son, he would just be reading about great people that came before him. Commanders in chief are to be guided by their own experience or genius. This is acquired only by your own experience and the studying of the great campaigns of all the great captains. And so he lists some of these people like Alexander, Hannibal, Caesar. And he says, they've all acted on the same principles to keep these other principles. Keep your forces united. ([Time 0:15:36](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9af64158-9744-4bfd-9bb1-0c1efdddf128))
    - **Note:** Learn from the best of others and your experience remain united avoid vulnerability bear down with rapidity on important points deeply study history create good past models. First idea is to figure out what he can do and if he can be successful do everything possible to make himself so. You cannot be guided by pen pushers avoid admins. There may be only one great moment you need to identify and seize it. Try to plan for every eventuality but on the battlefield empower commanders to make their own decisions because the game on the field changes and you need to trust your men. Advanced orders stifle initiative. Have excess ammo and provisions to be able to run efficient. Like buffet kept extra cash for a rainy day. Create anti fragility war should be methodical with a clear object. Organized D with great offense. 2/3rds must be calculated 1/3rd to chance. Read all the history but remain flexible. In war all is opinion about your own soldiers and the enemy expects to be flexible and to improvise. Tell your own story and control the narrative control public option. Master Public opinion tell your own story 10 people that tell have more influence than 10k quiet.

  Like if this happens, what do I do? If this happens, what do I do? And when you do that, that is a great way to find weaknesses in your company and then fix them. And it's a lot more profitable to fix them before somebody else exposes them. So I love that. I love using maxims as prompt for my own thinking. The strength of an army is the product of the mass by the velocity. So what he calls speed of action, right? The strength of the army is the product of the mass by the velocity, a rapid march augments the morale of an army and increases its means of victory. Now, obviously Napoleon's going to repeat rapid movement, rapidity, speed over and over again. But for some reason when I read that, I hear little Jeff Bezos in my head because I've read Jeff's shareholder letters three times. I think I've done, I don't know, six, eight podcasts on Jeff. I'll probably do 20 more over the lifetime of this podcast. And so you read so much about him and you listen to him speak and you read transcripts of his speeches and everything else. And so I have this little Jeff Bezos on my shoulder that I hear. And Jeff says, you can drive great people away by making the speed of decision-making slow. Why would great people stay in an organization where they can't get things done? So a rapid march augments the morale of your employees, of your team. Napoleon was a master of speed. He was quick to get started on a campaign, kept moving right along and struck hard as soon he was in contact with the enemy's main force. ([Time 0:27:57](https://share.snipd.com/snip/87b895a9-7240-4758-a3db-7e77b7b74417))
    - **Note:** Speed augments morale go fast. One way to go fast is to remove things that make you slow. Compress thoughts take decisive action. Long orders are the enemy of speed. Smaller must be faster. Great leaders need more audacity. Maneuver along flanks. Use all advantages take advantage of moats but nothing is absolute in war. Buy competition to prevent the defeated party from sallying. Money and excess makes people soft. Time and laziness kills all great companies and empires. You want to follow intelligent fanatics. Single threaded leader. Leaders are not influenced by emotion but maintain emotional stability. Intelligence and talent need to be balanced Ed with character and courage. Haven’t believe in destiny but cause and effect. Deep intensity and focus. War is surprises and you must take advantage of them. Psychological warfare don’t listen to enemies who complement you until after you capture them. Napoleon would spread positive propaganda about bad captains so they would keep their post. Need to learn from history.
