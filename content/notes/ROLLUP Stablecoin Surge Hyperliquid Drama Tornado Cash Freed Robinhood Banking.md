### Highlights

- **Utility over Mimetics in Crypto**
  - Cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Solana chose a utility-focused approach instead of mimicking Bitcoin's mimetic strategy.
  - This decision has been solidified by Ethereum's larger market compared to Bitcoin.
  - People generally prefer yield-bearing assets, evidenced by the high demand for treasuries.
  - The potential demand for block space in crypto is often underestimated and it should be a key factor in valuations.
  - Focusing on utility and generating fees should be prioritized over memetic approaches.

  You know, yeah, I think that there's an element to this, which is a long time ago, everyone other than Bitcoin. So Ethereum, Solana, whoever decided to not go down the mimetic route. They decided to go down the utility route. So that decision, in my opinion, has already been made. And it's a little bit silly at this point to try to go back on it. But the other reason I think it's silly is just because Ethereum has a larger market than Bitcoin. It has a larger market than you can look at these analogs. And there's a great interview that came out on Ford guidance a couple of years ago with an ex-central banker, Sir Paul Tucker. And he described he had a sentence, he was describing around COVID, why, and just why in general central banks have issued so much debt. And he had this one sentence, which to me was a massive light bulb, which was people prefer yield-bearing money to non-yield money. And what he was talking about there is there's a greater demand for treasuries a monetary money-like asset than there is for non-yield bearing dollars. And I just think you see this pattern repeated time and time and time again over long periods of time. And I think that we, for whatever reason, I see this all over the place, especially on the infrastructure side of things that we just said, oh, you know what, this is going to get commoditized And, you know, my revenues are going to go down over time and there's no use even competing for it. That's, that's not true, right? Like the thing that everyone consistently underappreciates in especially new paradigm shifts is just the amount of demand, right? It's, it's difficult. It's an unknown unknown. We, we can't, we know demand is coming. We don't know exactly what form it's going to take. We don't know when, you know, what year it's going to come in. But we do know that, like, there's no real point being in crypto if you're not betting on a massive increase in demand for block space. And even if, yeah, the percentage that you get to take as a slice of that goes down over time, even if it's very competitive, the market opportunity here is huge. And for some reason in crypto, we've just, we said, you know what? Revenue is impossible. I'm not even going to try for that. So I'm going to try for this memetic money like thing instead. And it was just way too soon to give up on the obvious course of action, which is to generate fees. Right. And I think, you know, the other reason, too, that people resist this in general is because if you run a DCF on the yield that something like Ethereum or Solana is generating, everything Looks very overvalued. It doesn't look great.
  David Hoffmann
  Yeah.
  Mike Ippolito
  Okay. I just, I think that, again, these things are not companies. I think that, again, if you look at the value proposition of something like an L1, it has other traits that are very desirable. Like they're very large. They're very liquid. They're global. You aren't taking things like counterparty risk. I don't think you're going to evaluate it exactly like you would a company and run a DCF on it. And again, I kind of look at treasuries as this really interesting market where why do people buy that? You're not taking very much risk, really large global market, very liquid yield. They're relatively similar. And so, yeah, I would really push back against the people that want to lean into something around memetics. Eventually, this market's going to get more quantitative, more serious, and you need a hard reason for people to buy and hold your L1 asset. And I think the answer is the same for everyone that's not Bitcoin. ([TimeÂ 0:38:34](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a9829df4-2a85-4f4a-bf40-70c649bfa5fe))
