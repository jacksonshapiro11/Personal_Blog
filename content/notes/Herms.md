  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  In the old system, the nobility, the royalty, it was like, like you're born noble or you're not. And it's kind of independent of how much money you have or what you do or what influence you have under Napoleon. He brought in this modern idea that you could shift your class. I mean, he was essentially a nobody and he became the emperor of Europe. That'll completely upset the mindset of people. Yep. So all this is happening. This is the best thing that could ever happen to Thierry. He's the best art is in most exclusive crafter of carriage wear, of a Kippage. The city is being transformed so that this can all be displayed prominently. Social stratifications are becoming more blurry. People can spend money for the first time to buy status. Great for business.
  Speaker 2
  These are like the disruption waves that enabled him to create a business. Yes.
  Speaker 1
  Before all this, before this era, there's no way that this evolves into Hermes or honestly that Louis Vuitton and what he's doing with luggage and with trunks, there's no way that that Evolves into Louis Vuitton. So speaking of both Hermes and Vuitton have one really important client, a key influencer, so to speak, that they both land at this time. ([Time 0:13:17](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e7a7da5b-bd6e-4b19-92db-9261508b3375))
    - **Note:** Hermes founder becomes an orphan due to Napoleon wars he’s from Germany moves to France and due to Napoleon wars class ideals became more meritocratic so this allowed for self made men. He trained for 17 years to be a master saddle maker. Napoleon 3 came to power and with that he rebuilt Paris to make it more open and status driven. This led to the rise in needing luxury to show status because family didn’t work anymore. Hermes and Louis vitton get jobs working for the emperor wife launches careers. Right place and time. There is an idea of passing the business through the family it’s on the 6th generation and everyone works as a craftsperson for years before starting they also have pivoted and grown from saddles to bags. They create this bag for horses but they see the ford factory and realize cars will be big and fall into the idea is making bags for cars. Goes to America sees the ford factory and the zipper both are important in the shaping of the company. They got an exclusive patent for zipper usage in Europe like novonordisk for diabetes.
- The Brothers' Rif Transition from Horses to Cars
  Key takeaways:
  - Emil collaborates with car companies which leads to a rift between the two brothers.
  - Adolph, the older brother, prefers to remain in the horse market and is not open to the transition to cars.
  - In 1919, Emil buys out Adolph and embraces the transition into the automobile era, seeking new ways to interest clients.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  When Emil comes back and he's running around making zippered jackets, he's collaborating with car companies, leads to a rift between the two brothers. Adolph, the older brother, he's much more conservative. He wants to remain in the horse market. He's kind of depressed about the car coming.
  Speaker 2
  He's like, Hey, I just want to remain a niche leather worker. And I'm not really cool with everything you're doing here. This is literally like he wants faster horses of the analogy of like, if you would ask people what they want, they say a faster horse, like he stuck in a horse land. Right.
  Speaker 1
  Now, I don't know if it was that he had his head in the sand or more just like he didn't want to go build a big company. Right.
  Speaker 2
  Which I could understand. Totally.
  Speaker 1
  I could totally understand that either way. In 1919, Emil buys him out and says, I believe in my ability to leave this company, making this transition into the automobile era. And legend has it that he goes to the craftsman in the Atelier above the shop in the faux board and says, okay, what are we going to do? What can we make with our hands here in this Atelier that will interest our clients today? And I think this is still kind of legend around our mess of like, what can we make with our hands that will interest our clients today? ([Time 0:33:19](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b9dc65b6-2031-4f64-b026-6bbc7b1bc0a1))
    - **Note:** Brother buys out the other wants to think bigger other brother wanted faster horses he was thinking about cars . Company call g card is what can we build today that will interest our clients. This is the idea for the smaller bag. The world is getting bigger with global travel and so they need to create these bags that convey status and they also partner with craftsman who make things instead of bringing in house partnership strategy instead of in housing counter to current strategy needed to scale quickly and elevated creators. Key tenants are craftsman accessible status transition to new tech and combination of whimsy and art nice but also comfortable. 4th generation shapes the business with trademark humor and imaginative flair. Dint take themselves too seriously playfulness with the brand. At this time it was all about the best products not about the brand at all this has changed.
- The Influence of Queen Elizabeth on the Popularization of Silk Scarves
  Key takeaways:
  - The French woman's uniform was popularized globally by British Queen Elizabeth by wearing them as head scarves in the 1940s
  - Queen Elizabeth wore whimsical and playful scarves on her head despite being the Queen of England for 60 to 70 years
  - Modern-day production of Hermes scarves involves sourcing the finest silk, some of which comes from their owned farms in Brazil
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Well, it's funny you say the French woman's uniform. Yes, that is entirely true. But the woman who really popularizes them around the globe is a British woman, specifically Queen Elizabeth. Oh, I didn't realize that really.
  Speaker 2
  Yeah.
  Speaker 1
  This is so iconic Queen Elizabeth. She starts wearing them as head scarves in the 1940s. And I mean, Queen Elizabeth, she's Queen of England for what? Like 60, 70 years. Yeah. And she's wearing these scarves, these whimsical, playful scarves on her head as the Queen of England. Fascinating.
  Speaker 2
  So this is a good time to talk about how these silk scarves are made. And I was going to do this later when we talk about their modern day production process, but it turns out that their modern day production process is not that different than it used to Be. So here is how Hermes scarves are made today. They are first sourcing the finest silk that they can find, which is now from their own, owned farms in Brazil. ([Time 0:50:29](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a3417e86-fb30-4ff8-81bd-8244f4a92cad))
    - **Note:** Scarfs until the 90s and silk was their hit product and queen Elizabeth popularized this. Fir scarfs make 2 designs a year takes 2 years to make design then retired then bring out if a vault. They screen print scarfs by hand. Etched by hand and perfect which is insane without a computer. Extreme craftsmanship and taste with total process power that’s super niche. Great attention to detail not seen elsewhere. They make callbacks to lore and are completely recession resistant. Hermes in theory owns their color orange which was a result of their normal cream color being out of stock during ww2 and an excess of orange that led to the pivot. When they bring art into it you’re not being comped to other features but creating a cerebral hard to quantify value that drives prices well above cost because it’s art. Priceless. Create dreams for customers. Grace Kelly was an American who became royalty in Monaco is pictures with the bag this changes the entire companies image great pr change the bag name to the Kelly bag.
- The Evolution of Luxury Brands
  Key takeaways:
  - Hermes' market changed in the 1970s as the next generation rejected the traditional luxury dream of the brand
  - Other luxury brands like Dior, Yves Saint Laurent, Gucci, and Chanel emerged in connection to fashion and offered different products compared to Hermes
  - Hermes is distinguished from other luxury brands by its origins in leather, horses, and durable goods, rather than couture fashion
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And it's particularly not working because like we just talked about, that market was not that big yet. And as we enter the 1970s, something really funny happens. The next generation rejects that dream. This is you and me, our parents' generation, the hippies, the 1970s, this is democratization. Little girls don't want to be Grace Kelly anymore. They want to be like Stevie Nicks or something like that. And the dream of Hermes that was once so elegant and so desired by so many people, but inaccessible is kind of now like, it's certainly still got its audience, but it's not as universal. This is when so many of the other, what we now think of as luxury brands really start to come up and we talked about this on the LVMH episode, but they're connected to fashion. It's first Dior, and then it's Yves Saint Laurent. This is the Mondrian dress from Yves Saint Laurent. This is the revolution. It's Gucci. It's Chanel in the 80s when Karl Lagerfeld takes over. And what they're selling is very, very, very different than what Hermes is selling.
  Speaker 2
  This is an important distinction between Hermes and all the brands you just named. They come from the world of couture and of fashion and of cutting edge in your face, risky art. And Hermes comes from, mind you, by this point, they're already 120 years old, 130 years old. They come from the world of leather and horses and durable goods that stand the test of time. And frankly, styles that stand the test of time. ([Time 1:14:21](https://share.snipd.com/snip/48b9be77-ac84-4aa8-867c-027b58e37502))
    - **Note:** In the 70s they started to lose their brand halo fall out of touch the old time luxury was being passed by couture. Luxury for a new age. Given they don’t change their fashion style is almost antithetical to fashion and changing trends. They brought in consultants who told them to shift strategy. They no longer hire consultants every generational transfer is at a critical point and every time the new generation has gotten it right and slightly altered the strategy that compounded the company faster. The birkin bag wasn’t an instant hit but over time gained a brand halo took 5 years and Hermes keeps prices lower than they could keeping up with inflation despite being oversubscribed. Takes company from 50mm in revenue to 2bn 40x in 30 years. 5th generation transformed it.
- The Importance of Tradition at Hermes
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  We've talked too many times without actually talking about the saddle stitch. It's time to actually talk about saddle stitching. So listeners, you might be wondering, why do they keep saying this? What does it mean? Saddle stitching is an amazing technique that Hermes uses for every single bag that they make. It can either, I can't tell if this is true or not, it can either only be done by hand or until recently only be done by hand, but it is a far more effective, high quality, and durable form Of stitching relative to the typical machine zone stitching that you're thinking about right now where the same thread goes through one needle and it goes up, down, up, down, up, down.
  Speaker 1
  It's also incredibly beautiful. It's got a slate, diagonal valence to it as opposed to the normal straight line stitching.
  Speaker 2
  Yes. So how does it work? So there's something called a horse that goes between your legs and the horse holds two pieces of leather together, the whole point of the saddle stitches to sew two pieces of leather Together. So you first punch little holes in the leather using likely a pricking iron as your method of doing this. And if you're good, you don't prick all the way through, you just poke a little hole with your pricking iron or all part way through. So that way you don't poke too big of a hole, you only end up pushing exactly a hole the size of your needle and thread through. And you can always tell if you're looking at something and it's stitched and there's these big freaking holes and then there's this thin thread that's moving through and there's space Between the thread and the leather. You know what kind of craftsmanship went into that. If it almost looks like the stitch vanishes into the leather and you're like, is there even a hole there? It's hard to even see how this was done. That is a saddle stitch. So you take your pricking iron or your all, you poke the hole or the partial hole. So there's a lot of muscle memory involved in this. You then pass one needle through going, call it from the right to the left side.
  Speaker 1
  And then you have a second needle on the other end of the thread. So one thread, two needles. Yes.
  Speaker 2
  That you pass through the other direction. And so what you've done as you pull both of them through is created this incredibly strong sort of interlocking mechanism. There's tensile force going in both directions. Yes. If it gets ripped, you're not at risk of the whole thing pulling out and your saddle or your bag falling apart, you just lose that one stitch and that one stitch can be repaired. And so the only way for you to unravel something that is saddle stitched together is to individually go through and cut every single stitch.
  Speaker 1
  Compare that to most products that you own.
  Speaker 2
  Yes. This literally provides high utility if you're in an achestrion jumping competition. Or if your bag needs to hold something that really needs a lot of protection and can't fall through, it's almost like it started with real necessary utility because something life-threatening Could happen. Now it's just massively overkill for everything that is saddle stitch, but you appreciate the craft behind it. There are very few people who are in a life or death circumstance that are dependent on their stitch holding true.
  Speaker 1
  I'm going to channel my inner PR Alexi here, the current artistic director of Avermez. I think it still has relevance if you want your object to be permanent. If you want an object that you own to represent something wholly different and antithetical to let's call it the Amazonification or the wall-martification of items these days, you Want it to be made like this. Yep.
  Speaker 2
  And something that made this really special for hundreds of years, if not still, is that it had to be done by hand. So if you want something of this quality, this gets this interesting idea, is handmade stuff better? Well, not necessarily. And Excel even says this in an interview. He says in 2019, today hand stitching is the highest quality. So machines are a non-negotiable. When the quality of a machine stitching gets better than hand stitching, we will do it. We are not a museum. And David, this is where you're getting we are not a museum quote from. But it really gets to this element of why our handcrafted goods desirable. Well, in this case, it literally creates something higher quality, more durable, certainly more aesthetically pleasing. Since when done well, you can't see that hole in between the thread and the leather. It's a pretty special process. And for everyone who's sort of wondering, okay, but what is the rest of creating one of these bags look like? Start to finish a Kelly bag, and we'll talk about working in a little bit. But similar story is made by one craftsman. So one craftsman starts with 36 unique pieces of high quality leather.
  Speaker 1
  As much as possible from the same animal and matched exactly. Yes, exactly.
  Speaker 2
  And so it's not sourced from all these different places all over the world. And one person's responsible for the bottoms and someone else is responsible for the straps. It is one craftsman that takes these 36 cuts and stitches it together. It takes 20 hours. And this is over the course of a few weeks to create this. So one person assembling it all, putting the fasteners on it, stitching it. This takes two years to learn how to do before you are allowed to create one for the first time. Oh, I think it's even more than that.
  Speaker 1
  It's two years of training to become a Hermes artisan period. I don't think you're allowed to touch the Birkins and the Kelly's when you start day one on the job. I believe you need at least another three years, if not more, before you're allowed to touch the Birkins and the Kelly's fascinating.
  Speaker 2
  So this knowledge is passed from generation to generation. And Hermes refers to this as the savoir fair, or the know how or the expertise about the materials and the exceptional technique that's transmitted from one craftsperson to another. Oh, hang on this.

- LVMH's Acquisition of Leica and Shang Xia
  Key takeaways:
  - Leica, a German camera company, was acquired by the largest shareholder, who had a stake of 30-35%.
  - The attempt to make Leica a luxury brand by adding features like Hermes leather did not go well.
  - Companies that try to buy up other brands often face challenges unless it is a core strategy like LVMH.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  This is kind of in your wheelhouse. Ooh, I don't know. I was wondering if I could stump you with this. They bought, I believe, a 30, 35% stake. They were the largest shareholder in a German company that makes what is really a piece of technology, an old piece of technology, but not something that should be a luxury brand. This is very much in the performance end of the spectrum. They became the largest shareholders in Leica, the camera company. Really?
  Speaker 2
  Yeah. Huh.
  Speaker 1
  Which, you know, I mean, sort of the motivation is like, oh, you know, they're beautiful and they're like luxurious cameras and they have leather on them and we can put Hermes leather On the Leica cameras.
  Speaker 2
  Yeah. If they made a Hermes edition Leica camera with a... They did? I should probably look into that.
  Speaker 1
  But okay, you're talking about a very narrow target market here and it's just, you know, it's a technology product. I mean, we'll get into this without following a minute, but it didn't go well. Let's put it that way.
  Speaker 2
  They ended up divesting the stake. It reminds me of when the New York Times did all of this with all the TV stations in the 90s, too. It's almost like every company that ever thinks it's a good idea to start buying up other brands is wrong. Yeah.
  Speaker 1
  Unless that is the core strategy of what you are doing, like LVMH. Yes. Yeah. The third thing that they do, they incubate and create a new luxury brand and company in China called Shang Shia. I believe I'm pronouncing that right. In 2009 is when they launch it. ([Time 2:24:52](https://share.snipd.com/snip/927bb499-6c9d-4391-8505-aa95360255a3))
    - **Note:** LVMH is bringing outside people into the company bernaurd arnaud is slowly buying shares to stage a take over in secret after he is rebuffed from Gucci. The family is doing well but maybe taking their eye off the ball they start making ancillary non strategic acquisitions they release a beach tote bag for $150 sells like hot cakes and is pulled but this only shows how bad the focus is Hermes doesn’t make beach bags. Strategic loss of focus. Bernard ready to attack. Legit chance they lose the company family is now 80 people. They bring in an artist director separate from the ceo first time ever they’re both killers one studied art history at grown the other did IB exposed to china. They also thought about creating a Chinese native fashion company as well. All these didn’t work well. Bernard owned 22.6% basically the entire public float. The family organizes a defense and in the face of life changing payouts creates a locked vihcle for 20 years with 51% to keep it family owned big chess move. Bernaurd ends up having to sell some Hermes and gets 8% more tax free LVMH out of it even when he losses he wins pure genius
- AI Conference and Hermes Revenue Growth
  Key takeaways:
  - The AI conference will take place on March 18th, 2021 at the San Jose Convention Center after a five-year hiatus
  - Key speakers include researchers from various renowned companies such as OpenAI, Meta, Google, and more
  - Futuristic vehicles and robots will be on display at the conference
  - Hermes generated 11.6 billion euros in revenue last year, with leather goods accounting for 43% of the business
  - Hermes is on track to reach approximately 14 billion euros in revenue

  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Yep. It'll be March 18th to 2021 at the San Jose Convention Center. And it is the first time back in person in five years, which is crazy. It's the most important AI conference in the world. And Jensen will be speaking to 10,000 people live in person.
  Speaker 1
  Wow. There are also researchers speaking from OpenAI, Meta, Google, DeepMind, Microsoft, Forge, NNTech, Disney, National Labs and more. It's crazy. They will have a whole bunch of futuristic vehicles, robots on display. Yep.

  If you want to check it out, click the link in the show notes and enter the code acquired at checkout, acqired to give you 20% off your ticket. And thanks to our friends at NVIDIA. Now back to Hermes.
  Speaker 1
  So this is an insane idea that leather goods, which is 43% of the business. Hermes did what 11.6 billion euros in revenue last year. They're on track to probably do call it 14 billion in euros.
  Speaker 2
  Yep. Last 12 months is 14 billion. Yeah.
  Speaker 1
  That 6 billion of that is going to be handcrafted items where one artisan makes one item at a time and they're sold around the world. Like 6 billion euros worth of that every year growing at 15, 20% a year. Yeah. Wild. ([Time 2:51:06](https://share.snipd.com/snip/01dac1fe-12da-4d62-bdb2-b08789ee5a02))
    - **Note:** The 6th generation comes in and aims for scale. They go from a few hundred to thousands and do this by creating a school and graduating 100% of people all with non binding offers to the company. They literally built a manufacturing base of young masters from a previously aged male workforce taken from poor areas. Horizontal integration. Hermes bundles exclusivity service craftsmanship shopping experience, and a great brand, and no one else can really give this that bundle has no competition everyone else pivoted or went out of business. Scale the old way
