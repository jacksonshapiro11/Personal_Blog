### Highlights

- **Roll-out vs. Roll-up and CEO Time Management**
  * Rolling out a business yields higher ROIC than rolling up acquisitions because the initial capital cost is significantly lower.
  * M&A should align with a customer-centric strategy focused on superior service, quality leadership, enhanced capabilities, and cost leadership.
  * CEOs manage capital allocation and time; M&A success is a team effort, with many people contributing behind the scenes.
  * Ask the people you acquire for their best ideas. Be aligned on the acquisition most of it is doing the ground work to make it easy.

  The reason why we made so much higher ROIC on the roll-out than on the roll-up is that the IC in ROIC was much lower. We weren't paying a big multiple of EBITDA to buy the business. We were just getting into the business. That strategy worked really well too. Although, to be fair, we only, I'm saying only in a modest way, we only outperformed the S&P 500 by about 2.2x at United Rentals than we did at United Waste.
  Speaker 2
  I like the nuance between the roll-out and the roll-up. One thing that I've certainly experienced, particularly in growth-focused M&A, is that it can be challenging for companies to divorce a deal model from a strategy or a business plan. Meaning, we're going to buy an asset, and that's going to give us a foothold. It's just a foothold. In addition, by owning that asset, we can now invest around it organically. Can you talk a little bit about how you manage those trade-offs or those discussions as an executive team on what's going to go into the deal model? How do you think about justifying the deal and tracking that, but then also investing around the asset?
  Speaker 1
  You have to do both. You can't do M&A in a vacuum. It just doesn't make sense. It doesn't create value. It's just random, really, nilly. You do have to have a strategy. That strategy has to center around, how am I able, as a result of this business plan, to provide a superior service to customers, so they choose us rather than choosing a competitor? Every decision that you make when you're embarking on a big plan like this has to be keeping that in mind. How is this going to help the customer? How is this going to make us more of a quality leader for the customer? How is this going to make us more of a service leader for the customer? How is this going to make us have more capabilities to offer the customer? How is this going to make us a cost leader? Our cost structure is superior to the competition, and we could charge maybe the same price as a competitor, but our margin is higher. There's lots of ingredients that have to go into the planning of the business, and then the M&A strategy has to match that strategy. Absolutely.
  Speaker 2
  One question I have, just reflecting on your comment on two to three deals a week, talk a little bit about your calendar and your role. I'm sure there are a lot of executives listening to this thinking, how could he possibly do that and do his day job? What advice would you give or what reflections you have in terms of just spending your time and where you focus your time and attention?
  Speaker 1
  The CEO always gets more credit than the CEO deserves because all these ventures are the result of many, many people, large teams doing lots of work, and they're not very visible to the Outside community. The CEO is the main spokesperson for the company and gets the credit, but it's not fair. The credit really is dispersed amongst many, many people doing due diligence, doing the actual negotiation, doing the integration, doing the technology, doing the whole back office, Realigning the sales and marketing territories and the Salesforce effectiveness. Everything that's involved in having a successful acquisition, that's a huge number of people. Now in terms of time, I'm glad you mentioned that because there's only two things you manage as a CEO. There's only two things that a management team needs to control very well in order to create a lot of shareholder value. That's allocation of capital and time. Time is very, very important. It's very limited. You have so many employees and so many hours of the day. You multiply those out. ([TimeÂ 0:06:55](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b4164774-f74c-4c8f-ba82-e0e4ee2e7f89))
