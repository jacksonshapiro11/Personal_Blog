  Speaker 1
  You certainly need the technical talent in biotech to succeed. What I try to tell people is when you're building a team, you're looking at resumes, look at the resume once, and do they cross the threshold for having on paper the technical abilities, And then put it away. Never look at it again and spend time with them. And I made this mistake many times where we were growing the company, those periods of growth where we just needed talent. We needed people who had the technical skills to conduct clinical studies to do research, even in finance administration, legal, all of those areas. And there were times we made mistakes. We just put people in the seat because we needed people in the seat. And boy, when you're growing fast, you come to regret that very, very quickly. Where we'd start to lose the culture and there'd be tension. And all of a sudden I'm distracted with managing HR and interpersonal challenges. And there were times where we had to make tough decisions to take people out at every level of the company because we had made a mistake. And what we decided a number of years ago is the most important thing is we have to screen to make sure people are passionate entrepreneurs. Those two words. First, passion. Do they believe in the mission? Do they want to be a team? And we developed some tools and abilities to screen for that. And not everybody does. You might think, God, I want to be all in. I want to save lives and biotech.

  Some people want a job and they want to show up. There's nothing wrong with that.
  Speaker 1
  But it wasn't what we were building at Amicus. They've got to be all in. That passion. They've got to want to be true owners of the company. They would have to want to be there when the times are tough. So the passion piece of it is essential. And then they have to be entrepreneurs. I don't care how big the company grew to and how many countries we were in or how many hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue we would have. They've got to be able to roll up the sleeves and realize their job is to solve problems every day. I tell people, if you think your job is to sit in a nice office, particularly when you're the CEO, have people bring your reports and good news all day. Good luck.
  Speaker 3
  You've got really smart people working for you. They're going to solve most of the problems that you never see.
  Speaker 1
  And you can have really smart people bring you the toughest problems that they can't solve. And that's your job. And you just lean into it. And every now and again, I'll kid around with Brad in the years that he was our chief operating officer. He'd screen a lot and solve a lot of the problems before they came to me. But every now and again, he'd show up on the door. There'd be the knock at eight in the morning and he'd have a smile.
