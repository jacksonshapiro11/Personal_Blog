  Speaker 1
  Through your mortgage this night and I realized that you're overpaying and I have negotiated a new rate on your behalf with a separate bank and the only thing you need to do in order to Save 10 bucks on your mortgage every month is for you to say yes because I'll do the older switching for you and I'll just move you to a different bank, right? Eventually that's going to happen. I don't know how fast it's going to go. I don't know when these things will become a reality but it's very clear that directionally speaking with the way software is developing and obviously in the last year now with AI you're Like, okay, that's much closer than I thought it was going to be. The point is like, it's like self driving cars, I don't know when it will happen, but I know it will eventually happen. So the conclusion was like, okay, so the future we're looking at and financial services is that, at some point of time, there will be this digital financial system that just does this On your behalf, right? Okay. So then the next question then is, okay, but where does that leave us? What do we do in that world? Like, what is Klana in that world? Well, obviously, you said like, well, the best position to be in is I want to be your digital financial assistant, because maybe if I did that for you, Ben, you give me a dollar tip for like, Hey, thank you for fixing that mortgage thing. I'll give you a dollar and tip.
  Speaker 2
  If you can get me a cheaper mortgage, I'll give you a lot more than a dollar in it. Yeah. Seriously. I'm happy to hear that.
  Speaker 1
  I'm happy to hear that.
  Speaker 3
  So the point is that like. Can we talk after this episode?
  Speaker 1
  Exactly. What this all means is that eventually you'll have to be that digital financial advisor, right? Which in a way is kind of what you would think of as like, what was the purpose of a traditional bank man? It was your financial advisor that would like, hey, I'm gonna take care of your finances, of your savings. I'm gonna make sure that they grow. I'm gonna take care of all this stuff that you don't understand and don't have an interest in. And I'll just make sure that you're good off. The only problem is that once bank got that trust from us as customers, they took it to their advantage. And they started finding all these ways to not necessarily serve our best interests as customers. But at some point in time, we just realized that's directionally where financial services are going. And it is going to be a very, very disruptive force. Because, for example, one of the it means, it means the end of the excess profits that we have seen in banking industry. So in banking industry, we've always had excess profits because people are not very easily moving between banks because they find it hard and difficult to change and they're not sure They're getting any value. A lot of these things will go away and it's just going to look like a very different industry than it does today. And so we said, well, okay, we want to be that digital financial advisor. Well, then the next question is, how do you win that? How do we make sure that Klarna is the best digital financial advisor? And we concluded, we don't know everything, but we know a few things. We know that it is beneficial to be global over being local, because this will be a question of scale. The more markets you serve, the more consumers you serve, the more likely you are to be able to operate such a thing. It's gonna be about volume of size. It's gonna be important, right? So global distribution was very critical. So that's when we said, we have to really expand our network of a number of countries. That was like one, right? The second thing is data. The more I understand, the more you Ben or you David have, the more you have trusted me of data about yourselves, about your transactions, about, you know, your financial life, the more Likely and capable I will be to be able to provide you advice and services of value, right? Because the better I understand you as customers, the more likely I'm able to actually save you time, save you money, you know, do something that's of value for you, right? So we then realized that Klana had one very unique thing that really sets us apart, that to me is much, much, much more critical and has been much more at the core of what Klarna is than buy Now, pay later. And that is skew level data. So whenever we started a business, because we started as an open invoice business, we needed to produce an invoice at the very beginning of our life as a company. That meant we needed skewlevel details on every purchase. ([Time 0:39:58](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2d995844-6d0a-4724-9389-3a6142783898))
