### Highlights

- Embrace Asymmetry for Optimized Execution
  Summary:
  Scaling Ethereum's execution layer involves careful adjustment of the EVM to enhance performance without compromising existing applications.
  By employing 'snarkification,' the EVM can be modified externally, allowing for significant increases in gas limits—potentially 10x to 100x—by alleviating validator bottlenecks through zero-knowledge proofs. This method permits validators to verify only succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (SNARKs), drastically reducing verification times and enabling larger blocks without risking denial of service.
  Additionally, the introduction of programmable native rollups empowers developers to create independent EVM instances, fostering scalable and customizable solutions aligned with Ethereum's ethos.
  This forward-thinking approach not only enhances throughput but also harmonizes rollup projects with Ethereum's core principles, enabling them to easily transition toward being more integrally connected with the Ethereum ecosystem.

  And like incrementally with multiple forks, we're just scaling that part of the roadmap. So I feel like we don't have to camp on there. What would be really interesting from my perspective, Justin, and the story that has been told less often is the execution layer on the layer one. And this has been sort of a chant that has happened recently. Indeed, when we started this episode, that sort of what I was hoping for from your announcement at DevCon is kind of like, what are we going to do to make the Ethereum layer one great again And to improve that economic zone? And I do see at the end, a box that says native roll ups. But maybe before we get to the end state here, can you just like summarize? What is the vision for in this layer one roadmap, Ethereum's layer one execution Is this a strategy to make the theorem layer one great again? Or like, what does this even look like in your mind?
  Speaker 1
  So at the execution layer, we're very much constrained by the way that the EVM is defined, right? The EVM is directly consumed by application and there is a need for forward compatibility. So the way that we change the EVM is extremely slowly and cautiously so that we don't break the existing applications. And so if we're going to make big, massive changes to the EVM, we need to think out of the box. And the out of the box solution basically boils down to snarkifying the whole EVM. In some sense, snarkification is something that is done outside of the EVM as opposed to changing the internals and the guts of the EVM. Now, one of the big performance metrics of the EVM is gas per second. How much execution can we push through the EVM? And the main bottleneck that we have now is on the validator side of things. They have to verify that these EVM blocks are valid. And the way they do it today is the naive brute force way, in the sense that they have to re-download the entire block, and then they have to re-execute the entire block. And so now you see that the bottleneck is basically the slowest validator on the network and their ability to validate the block. But what we can do with ZK is that we can create a massive asymmetry between the performance of the builders, on the one hand, that produce the blocks, and those that verify the validity Of the block, they only have to verify a SNOC. So the primary reason why we have a gas limit is to prevent a massive block from coming in. And then it takes many, many seconds to verify. And that's not enough time for the validators to come in and make sure that it's valid. So ultimately, the strategy here is to grow the gas limit by 10x, by 100x, just by removing this possibility for denial of service attack with these very, very big blocks. And the reason, again, is that the validators only have to verify a SNOC, which takes roughly one millisecond, regardless of how much computation was done. So once we've SNOCified the whole EVM, which is a process that happens off-chain, one of the very first things that we can do is start increasing the gas limit, and do so safely, without Compromising decentralization at all on the validator side of things. But then comes the really cool thing, which you mentioned, which is the native rollups. What the native rollups allow us to do is to scale the EVM horizontally. It allows any developer who wishes to launch a new instance of the EVM to make basically a copy of the EVM. And each copy will have its own gas limit. So if we're able to have, you know, let's say a gas limit that is 100 times larger than today, so that would be three giga gas per block. Well, you know, now we can have n times three giga gas per block, where n is the number of copies of these native rollups that have been programmed by developers. Now, one of the important things to stress here is that these are programmable native rollups, not the top-down, centrally controlled type of rollups known as execution sizing. So in the previous Ethereum roadmap, we had this notion where there would be a fixed number, for example, 64 shards or 1,024 shards, and they would be exact copies of the EVM. And my personal belief is that this goes against the ethos of Ethereum, because the ethos of Ethereum is all about programmability. And so we should be able to program several things. One, the number of rollups shouldn't be some sort of hard-coded and dictated number from the top down. It should just be an emergent property of the market. And then the second aspect is that if someone wants to customize the rollup, for example, have their own gas token or have their own sequencer or have their own governance system around It, then they have the option to do so. And what that would allow is for all of the existing EVM rollups to upgrade to become native rollups. And in that sense, what will happen is that all of the rollups would become one step closer to becoming Ethereum itself. Ethereum has many things to offer. It can offer settlement, it can offer DA, it can offer sequencing, and it can offer the virtual machine. And there's terms that we use for each of those. If you consume settlement, we say that you're an L2. If you consume DA, we say that you're a roll-up. If you consume the sequencing, we say that you're based. And if you consume the virtual machine, we say that you're native. And so if you do all of these things and you're a based native rollup, then the term that I use is you're an ultrasound rollup. The maximally aligned thing possible. But of course, it's up to you to determine how aligned you want to be with Ethereum.

  I want to put a pin on this subject because I really like this illustration. You say how aligned you are with Ethereum. The way that I would illustrate this is like how close to the core are you of Ethereum? ([Time 1:00:36](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e8d3f8f0-629d-4521-a5b7-fe5396d9f828))
