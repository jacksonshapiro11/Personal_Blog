- Full Title: From Prediction Markets to Info Finance
- Category: #articles

- Summary: Prediction markets are not just about betting on elections; they can provide valuable information and insights across various fields. This broader concept, called "info finance," uses financial markets to align incentives and improve decision-making. With the help of AI, we can make these markets work effectively even for small-scale questions, unlocking their full potential.

### Highlights

- Conclusions
  These ideas have been theorized about for a long time: the earliest writings about prediction markets and even decision markets are decades old, and theory of finance saying similar things is even older. However, I would argue that the current decade presents a unique opportunity, for several key reasons:
  • **Info finance solves trust problems that people actually have**. A common concern of this era is the lack of knowledge (and worse, lack of consensus) about whom to trust, in political, scientific and commercial contexts. Info finance applications could help be part of the solution.
  • **We now have scalable blockchains as the substrate**. Up until very recently, fees were too high to actually implement most of these ideas. Now, they are no longer too high.
  • **AIs as participants**. Info finance is relatively difficult to make work when it must depend on humans to participate on each question. AIs greatly improve this situation, enabling effective markets even on small-scale questions. Many markets will likely have a combination of AI and human participants, especially as volume on specific questions suddenly switches from small to large.
  To take full advantage of this opportunity, it's time to go beyond just predicting elections, and explore the rest of what info finance can bring us. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01je25qedw294n4pdd8jpf7mgd))
    - **Note:** Info finance imagine someone sends out a tweet and there is a betting market on the legitimacy of that tweet. AI agents validate this.
