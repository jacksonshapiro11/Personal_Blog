### Highlights

- A sustainable human society should be adaptive robust and resilient to disasters learning from mistakes non static allows for growth in quality and quality of life. Need a diverse group of people trying different experiments in organization and culture

    - **Note:** Good society is anti fragile diverse in viewpoints and constantly growing.
- The edge of chaos is t a location it’s a region where complex life exists
    - **Tags:** #complexity, #edge-of-order-and-chaos
    - **Note:** Edge of order and chaos is where life is formed.
- Artificial life is the idea that the laws of life are not through analysis like conventional biology but understanding. Life by synthesis putting simple pieces of the life puzzle together to create characteristics. Life is not matter but an organization of that matter. The laws of life must be laws of dynamic form regardless of being carbon based life forms. Ie life on other planners can be life without any of the biological similarities essence of life only when we view life as what it could be will we understand life as it truly is. While organizations build top down life comes bottom up with key pieces being formed through simplicity but very complex things can come out of very few and simple building blocks. Why due to entropy at a small scale things are trending towards chaos while at a larger scale things are able to former high levels of order such as stars and galaxies low level disorder leading to an emergent property of order. Connectionism the power lies in the connections very simple initiatial states like neurons for connections of subroutines that create the basis for knowledge complex outcomes from simple inputs. So you can build on old connectors building sustaining knowledge or do the equivalent of ripping connections out which is disruptive learning. Local vs global maximums. The essence is in the connections not the base inputs. Life exists at the edge of chaos where order and chaos overlapping form complexity. Entities trend towards the edge of chaos because it is evolutionarily optimal. Learning and evolution guide beings through history on the edge of chaos leading to more order through time and more complexity

    - **Note:** Life is not biological but organizational. There are many carbon based things we do not consider living and likewise there may be many non carbon or inorganic organisms that can meet our criteria of life. Life is the dynamic organization of matter often from simple rules. From simple bottoms up rules comes high level complexity. We need to view life for what it is. Self organization
      Entropy why is the world trending towards chaos at lower levels but at higher levels of emergence there is more order.
      Connectionism the idea that knowledge lies in the connections and simple things like neurons create connections for great knowledge. This feeds into local vs global maximum because sometimes you need to form new connections while other times you need to rip it all up.
      Learning at the edge of order and chaos. Life is a process not a thing. Comes emergent from connected systems.

    - **Note:** Life comes from very simple inputs but they are organized by rules in such a way to create something amazing. Life is in the organization of matter a self organizing system not just a collection of matter. The rules of life and creation are bottoms up with very few inputs at the base layer. Entropy and chaos are growing at a small scale but it seems like chaos is actually decreasing at a macro scale as humans create order. Knowledge isn't in the facts but in the mental models the facts create and knowledge routines that exist. Sometimes you build on connections other times you take a big step back to reach a hopefully higher summit.
      Life is a thing a system knowledge lies in the connections. Essence of life in the connections.
- approach emphasize increasing returns bounded rationality and the dynamics of evolution and learning instead of static equilibrium perfect information and decreasing returns. Instead of convenient assumptions they would try to make psychologically realistic models. Think of the world as a dynamic ever changing system at the edge of chaos. Problem contexts aren’t well defined and environment is not stationary but you still need to learn in the environment. Prediction isn’t the essence of science the essence is comprehension and explanations. You can design an auto catalytic system with self replicating entities that can do things much quicker than expected. Ie from these basic building blocks life can be created much quicker. Random reactions happen but if we have chemical catalysis this can super charge life if you had these building blocks floating around you could crate life more rapidly than just random luck. Co evolution nothing happens in a bubble when one thing in the environment changes the things in its niche co evolve and adapt cheeta becomes really fast to chase down gazelles and as a reaction gazelles get fast to avoid cheetas. Tit for tat cooperation was the optimal game theory strategy to maximize outcomes. Opening with kindness and if the other program responds kindly likewise continue the positive feedback if negative response mirror that as well this blends tough and fair with an optimistic tilt which while simple is either optimal or near optimal for long continuing relationships one off might be different so eventually because it’s highest ev this style will be dominant

    - **Note:** The essence of science isn’t prediction but comprehension and explanation. Ie good explanations
      We must see the world as a complex adaptive system where everyone is evolving to win in their niche. In these systems randomness creates progress but understanding catalysts and behavior can help jumpstart growth. This leads to co evolution.
      Game theory helps to open up kind but react to the competition cooperation is always higher ev but defection is needed when dealing in certain environments
- Wolframs 4 classes of rules ranging from non moving to complex alive adaptive systems like the game or life to complete chaos. At the transition point you are in a state between order and chaos. Half solid half liquid in a constant dance never settling. Deep connection between computation and phase transitions and between phase transitions and life itself. Lambda values that demonstrated phase transitions look into more. Level 4 rules allow you to build a computer. Using phase transitions complexity and computation wrapppes together in these level 4 rules. The key rules of life and fluidity seemed bottom up with no central control completely emergent
  Class 1: Cellular automata which rapidly converge to a uniform state. Examples are rules 0, 32, 160 and 232.
  Class 2: Cellular automata which rapidly converge to a repetitive or stable state. Examples are rules 4, 108, 218 and 250.
  Class 3: Cellular automata which appear to remain in a random state. Examples are rules 22, 30, 126, 150, 182.
  Class 4: Cellular automata which form areas of repetitive or stable states, but also form structures that interact with each other in complicated ways. An example is rule 110. Rule 110 has been shown to be capable of universal computation,

    - **Note:** At level 4 or the highest level of complexity order and chaos blur together and complex structures are formed with a deep order to them. The key rules of life seemed bottom up transforming into emergent structures.
      Rule 4 is a dynamic complex adaptive system.
- Knowledge can be expressed in mental structures like rules these rules are in competition and good rules grow stronger and bad rules weaker and rules get combined into new rules. Create a default hierarchy at a base level you do one thing like pet the dog but if the circumstances are abnormal such like the growling dog you don’t pet the dog
    - **Tags:** #favorite, #mental-models, #hierarchy, #latticework-of-models, #rules-in-systems, #knowledge-structures-(multiverses), #evolution, #good-explanations
    - **Note:** Mental models and progress through good explanations. Hierarchical and structured knowledge. Good explanations with good rules surviving and bad ones dying
- Heuristics step by step approach to problem solving coming up with guesses and adjusting to get closer to the truth. Step by step approach finding the best models was analogous to human reasoning. Learning through coherent self reinforcing structures of a cluster is coherent and stable enough it could serve as a basis for things at a bigger level these coherent structures and building blocks on building blocks formed a good basis for a general theory of systems. Breaking big things into small things then building from there like program functions is an easier way to build. Divide and conquer and once you know basic building blocks you can abstract further like a red fire truck. Once tit understand those basic things you can fit that model into your worldview. Adaptive systems instead of going step by step can reshuffle completely and create giant leaps of knowledge. So of you can discover the 10 building blocks and see how it’s arranged you get closer to the truth be seeing and testing their interactions. In programming you want to create the right instructions in the right order but if you don’t know the right order you can use a guided search of genetic algorithm that tries to maximize an output function. Reproduction and cross over lead to efficiency in knowledge growth
- A complex adaptive system has many levels of organization with lower level building blocks forming higher level organisms and on and on ie a cell is made of atoms and a human is made of cells and a community is made a humans and a city is made of communities and there are different levels of interaction between all these levels actions at any level will impact actions at every other level. Constantly revising and changing as new information comes in and is reacted to. All these process if learning adapting and evolution are the same and one way they do this is through building blocks modifications and these systems are predictive and reactive. Complex adaptive systems struggle to find a global maximum and stable equilibrium often they struggle jumping from place to place due to competition the most they can do is change and improve wrt other agents complex adaptive systems are perpetual novelty. The issue with economics is making a science out of imperfect agents exploring a limitless problem space of possible solutions. You can do trillions of things we can’t assume we’re always going to do the right thing or even close. Chess a small number of rules can create an incomprehensibly infinite amount of states all leading to 3 clear outcomes. Same with science built on simple laws but these laws create the amazing and complex reality that we live in its reductionist but the interactions create something infinitely complex and magnificent. Create a model of an opponent and using that model to create predictions of the best line of play ie AI. Through a microscope the brain seems to be completely chaotic but the brain clearly produces clear thought and action from this chaos so it isn’t random. The brain is also not static as it revises its models and learns. The organization of behavior by heb brain makes small synaptic changes which form the basis for all learning and memory comes in from one way and strengths the impulses it runs through creating a neural path so a previously thought random network becomes an organized learning loop with often used synapses growing stronger and weaker synapses atrophying eventually memory is encoded in synapses selective strengthening then different paths collectively form subroutines based on groups of synapses and this forms the base for thought and knowledge these small assemblies organize into bigger structures forming the fundamental quantum of thought. Neural networks abstract connections between nodes with different weights that through time go up or down because they receive the desired or undesired results

    - **Note:** This passage/note is a great point on complex systems. The description of the brain being chaotic but producing higher order building and destroying knowledge is very interesting. Sometimes you can build on top of knowledge other times you need to blow it all up and start from zero.
      Complex adaptive systems and different levels of emergence leading to different levels of chaos, order and events . Atoms make up cells which make up humans and communities ect. All these things working together creates so many things that need to be predicted across and unbounded amount of outcomes it becomes difficult to conceptualize. Likewise this problem and solution set isn't static but constantly evolving revising reacting and changing with no global maximum or stable equilibrium.
      Chess is a simple game with bounded moves that we can't solve but can try to win with ai the economy is infinitely more complex in all ways yet we think we can simplify and solve it.
- 2nd derivative non linearity in economic systems drives systems to order but 3rd order non linearity drives systems away from order deeper into chaos. In non linear systems even small differences in the initial state extrapolate to large ones eventually
    - **Tags:** #initial-conditions, #non-linear-effects
    - **Note:** Dependence on initial conditions randomness. Non linear growth. Small changes compound into large ones.
- Great syntheses across disciplines that United grand theories. A grand theory not for the simple but also for complex emergent structures. The origin of life is too intricate to be discovered by accident there has to be some deeper structure of knowledge that governs life. Are we really a miracle or is life finding a way because higher level emergent behaviors from complex systems tend to organize in a certain way and lead to the structures we see in our world. Is life finding a way or on a crash course with a deeper theory of complex systems. The copper atom on Winston Churchill’s nose getting there with simple or complex explanations. Auto catalytic sets means life could’ve bootstrapped it way into existence through very simple molecules which reacted with each other and created a chain of reactions that eventually sparked life as in life is the product of catalytic reactions and then further weather could’ve mixed these two primordial chemical reactions and created a natural selection between these two auto catalytic reactions therefore jump starting life. Natures desire for self organization. Natural laws of auto catalytic sets - how many polymers are there and how many catalysts cause a reaction between the two because catalysts scale faster than polymers there would have to be a probability that these reactions would occur with some complexity given the probability there would almost have to be a reaction and life would have to form. Amino acids make polymer chains leads to life. Economy has good and services which are the amino acids of the reaction. Innovations result from old technologies once you get to a certain level of complexity the economy reaches an escape velocity if you increase complexity over a point your economy can take off. If you inject another molecule into the auto catalytic set it could completely disrupt and destroy the reaction this is the idea of disruption. We get the starts of models for notable revolutions.
- Some things in science are linear like light you can see one ray of light from the sun and another from your phone but others are non linear ie your brains reaction to light if it’s a picture of something you love vs something you hate is very different non linear reactions due to complex systems
- Moving from reductionism to complexity. What are the building blocks of life ie electrons and quarks but then how do these fundamental uniform qualities form completely different and unpredictable systems. Complex adaptive systems. When it came to real world complexity’s fancy equations and elegant mathematics were no more than limited tools and the key tool was insight the ability to see complex connections. Economics was predictive of obvious things taking a simple idea and complicating it with math while neutralizing it with assumptions that destroyed the ideas pure essence. While they predicted things like taxation and inflation the theories didn’t compensate or explain the fundamentally messy world that existed it was too reductionist for it Self organization depends on self reinforcement for a soup to boil it needs a constant flame or else it will sit at room temperature positive feedback loops. Small changes create big changes one molecule moves slightly faster because it’s slightly warmer and soon enough they’re all zipping around unpredictably Instead of decreasing returns and efficiency over time there can be increasing returns like the pilgrims wanted to go to Virginia but their boat drifted off course and they landed in mass and set up a colony there had they landed in Virginia as planned the world would look different and they didn’t just move to Virginia they set up a whole society due to an accident completely unpredictable events lead to a chain that may be unable to stop and was unable to fully predict but changes literally every event after it because of increasing returns in chaotic systems The essence of science isn’t prediction it’s good explanations you don’t know what species is next in the human evolution but that doesn’t nullify Darwin’s theory. Good explanations is the core of science After a discovery there becomes lock in which produces increasing returns we don’t use the QWERTY keyboard because it’s efficient it was designed to be inefficient so type writers didn’t break but now everyone uses it so no one can really switch without high switching costs and the marginal gain is negligible for the risk of production/ market fit. Found a mathematical equation that was path dependent different interactions could lead to wildly different results

    - **Note:** Many of our tools take complicated situations and simplify them to make exact predictions (like econ) these are exactly wrong. We cannot reduce complex adaptive systems and must understand them at higher levels of emergence and their feedback loops/ self re-enforcement.
      The essence of science isn’t prediction it’s good explanations - we need to understand things well and know why they happen then we can go about predicting them.
      Complex adaptive systems and good explanations not reductionism with a tilt due to initial conditions and path dependence. We have equations that try to be exactly right but they’re too reductionist and destroy complexity which is the feature not the bug.
      Extreme path dependence levels of emergence good explanations. Appreciate complexity. The answer is complexity.
