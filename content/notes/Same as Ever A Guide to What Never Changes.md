### Highlights

- Wounds Heal, Scars Last: What have you experienced that I haven't that makes you believe what you do? And would I think about the world like you do if I experienced what you have? / 05:30:31Wounds heel scars last. The pentagon has been repaired but the scars can be seen at the airport. Peoples mindsets get fixed by their experience think depression mindset ect. Hardcore stress leaves permanent scars. What have you experienced that I haven’t that would change my point of view. What are we ignorant about that makes all the difference tough to admit but drives everything
    - **Tags:** #perspective-taking, #disagreements, #path-dependence, #different-selves, #scars, #wounds-vs-scars, #different-things-for-different-people
    - **Note:** What is driving our subconscious to a certain place. The deep scars of situations reverberate. What experiences could I have had to think what you do. Path dependence and perspective taking.
- Trying Too Hard: There are no points awarded for difficulty. / 05:15:12There is no points fir difficulty but just the results. Curing cancer is just getting people not to get cancer not these complex treatments you cure more cancer by banning smoking than oncology but we’re addicted to complexity because it looks and sounds smart. Complexity sells better but cover the hard full that matters. Reduce the number of parts and optimize the important parts. Just need the few big mental models that carry all the weight. Complexity gives the of control and there is a difference between simplicity and being uninformed but that’s hard to tell. We feel like simplicity is harder to justify and doing something hard doesn’t win you any points.
- Time Horizons: Saying I'm in it for the Long run is a bit like standing at the base of Mount Everest, pointing to the top, and saying, "That's where I'm heading." Well, that's nice. Now comes the test. / 05:06:27Easier to say you’re thinking in the long run than actually doing it. The long run is just a bunch of short runs. Long term thinking is harder than short term because you need to hold when you want to act. Short term is the only way long term is very tough. That’s why there are more returns to the long term thinking. You need to figure out when you’re being patient vs stubborn. Covering a bad investment saying you’re long term is wrong. Think long term but change your mind. You need to remain flexible in your thinking look for signal in the noise.

    - **Note:** Long-term versus short term thinking you need to be aware when you’re being dogmatic versus patient, which is very difficult and we live in the moment so it’s tough to think generations ahead. Easier than it seems to be long term vs say you’re long term. We say we think long term but that’s hard because we can only live in the moment so we really can’t live in the future we must do that through the present. Delay gratification through happiness in the moment.
- Now You Get It: Nothing is more persuasive than what you've experienced firsthand. / 04:59:00
  Tue, Nov 14 | 7:16:19 PM
  When we experience unexpected hardship like 1930s Germany or the Great Depression we change our views quickly and try everything. In crisis we’re more mentally flexible and underestimate the changing world. We’re greedy when others are fearful until the event happens like Covid and we thing the world is over and sell everything. People think getting rich is the answer then their experience is not that.

    - **Note:** First hand experience trumps everything. You’re greedy when others are fearful until you’re not. Take advantage of crises.
- Incentives: The Most Powerful Force in the World: When the incentives are crazy, the behavior is crazy. People can be led to justify and defend nearly anything / 04:47:37
  Tue, Nov 14 | 7:06:57 PM
  Incentives drive outcomes always. Which of your views would change if your incentives did. Positive and negative incentives drive outcomes.

- Harder than It Looks and Not as Fun as It Seems: The grass is always greener on the side that's fertilized with bullshit. / 04:35:46
  Tue, Nov 14 | 6:58:21 PM
  Our lives are as hard as everyone else’s but everyone just hides that well. Everyone has different difficulty ores they think is unique to them but it isn’t. Everything looks better from the outside but in the inside everyone has a lot of issues. The grass is greener on the side fertilized with bs. We all say the good things not bad but we need to accept both. Be more accepting g of yourself and tolerant of others.
    - **Tags:** #tolerant-of-others-strict-with-yourself, #tolerent-society, #problems-(everyone-has-own), #never-know-someones-problems, #empathy/sympathy-(understand-others-perspective)
    - **Note:** Be accepting of yourself, and tolerant 
      of others we all have our own problems and we don’t recognize that everyone else has the same magnitude of problems even though they might be slightly different and we need to appreciate and respect that. Cultivate empathy everything looks better from the outside.
- The Wonders of the Future: It always feels like we're falling behind, and it's easy to discount the potential of new technology. / 04:26:20
  Tue, Nov 14 | 6:50:45 PM
  Be optimistic about the future of innovation. The future of invention and discovery is greater than we believe. Innovation is hard to predict and easy to underestimate go long self organization. Remain actively optimistic. Go long emergence and exponential growth.

    - **Note:** Go long innovation and active optimism it’s the highest ev way forward. Don’t discount new emergent tech or its positive impacts.
- Keep Running: Most competitive advantages eventually die. / 04:14:25
  Tue, Nov 14 | 1:24:28 PM
  Seeds of the fall are sown in success. Eventually things that create big moats get disrupted. Advantage has a shelf life this gets killed because of overconfidence growing too fast and not being able to adjust to have success at a bigger size losing the competitive fire after success hubris is the beginning of failure. Skills have half lives because they degrade over time may not have value in the next decade. Some success is just due to luck but competitive advantages erode over time. Red queen hypotheses you need to keep running to even stay in place in a fast moving world.
    - **Tags:** #skill-matrix, #red-queen-hypothesis, #competative-advantage, #adapt-or-die, #seeds-of-the-fall-sown-in-success, #sustaining-vs-disruption
    - **Note:** seeds of the fall are sown in success every advantage has a shelf life you must adapt or die. Red queen you need to keep running advantages fade over time and some is due to hubris erosion or luck
- It's Supposed to Be Hard: Everything worth pursuing comes with a little pain. The trick is not minding that it hurts. / 03:56:22
  Tue, Nov 14 | 1:07:16 PM
  There are no short cuts it’s not supposed to be easy doing the hard thing over the long run is easier short/ long term incentive misalignment grow through hardship. Deserve what you want it’s supposed to be really hard. If we can’t tolerate inefficiency and bullshit we will fail at life. You need to figure out how much bullshit you can reasonably tolerate to come up with the best job and line of work for you. Optimal level of hassle. Where there’s pain there’s profit
    - **Tags:** #long/short-term-incentive-misalignment, #excellence-is-the-capaicty-to-take-pain, #deserve-what-you-get
    - **Note:** Long-term short term incentive alignment we need to tolerate bullshit and hassle because that’s how we get rewarded. This is basically just excellence. Is the capacity to take pain. Deserve what you get.
- Casualties of Perfection: There is a huge advantage to being a little imperfect. / 03:44:12
  Tue, Nov 14 | 12:39:34 PM
  Perfection an inefficiency are vital in success you need slack in the system to survive and thrive. Optimizing your schedule is better in the short term worse in the long term. You need time to think to improve. Blind walk through the forest over constantly processing. Directionally right vs exactly wrong. Think bigger picture. Forecasts need to be good enough.
    - **Tags:** #long/short-term-incentive-misalignment, #inefficiency, #overoptimizing, #rest-and-recover, #reflection
    - **Note:** Inefficiency gives you time to think and reflect. Build slack into your day to optimize for the long term better life not short term more productive day.
- Elation and Despair: Progress requires optimism and pessimism to coexist. / 03:32:54
  Tue, Nov 14 | 12:31:05 PM
  Plan like a pessimist dream like an optiMist the soldiers who thought they’d be home by Christmas died sooner. The ones who knew they’d get home eventually and kept the faith lived. Active optimism vs blind optimism or pessimism
    - **Tags:** #actively-optimistic
    - **Note:** Act like a pessimist dream like an optimist.
- Tiny and Magnificent: When little things compound into extraordinary things. / 03:27:14
  Mon, Nov 13 | 7:42:58 AM
  Tiny built up risks are more likely to cause a significant problem than one massive obvious one. You’re less likely to launch a nuke than a small bomb but a bunch of small bombs can trigger the nuke that wouldn’t have been fired likewise with economic disasters it’s small compounding things that lead to the big blow up. The compounding time horizon is much more important than the rate.
    - **Tags:** #proactive-not-reactive, #problems-(face-head-on), #negative-compounding, #compounding, #risk-=-what-you-dont-see
    - **Note:** Tiny risks build to greater ones so you need to kill problems when they’re small don’t let them compound out of control.
- Overnight Tragedies and Long Term Miracles: Good news comes from compounding, which always takes time, but bad news comes from a loss in confidence or a catastrophic error that can occur in a blink of an eye. / 03:13:34
  Mon, Nov 13 | 7:36:41 AM
  Good news takes time but bad news takes seconds. Us gdp grew 8x in 100 years by growing at 3% but everyone’s lives changed instantly on pearl harbor. Complex to create simple to destroy.
    - **Tags:** #long/short-term-incentive-misalignment, #what-you-see-is-all-there-is, #system-destruction, #system-construction, #compounding, #long-term-mindset, #complex-to-create-simple-to-destroy
    - **Note:** Complex to create simple to destroy good things take time to compound while bad things are often instant.
      I kinda reject this while things are complex to create violence drugs and sex sells may be a better frame because perfectly horrible things like global warming went unseen until a crisis.
- When the Magic Happens: Stress focuses your attention in ways that good times can't. / 02:53:48
  Mon, Nov 13 | 7:28:21 AM
  Stress causes great innovation and reason for it. Wanting to innovate to win ww2 lead to investment in everything and deployment of all resources. There is no motivation like horrible threats and certain death. Stress focuses attention the way good times can’t. WW2 began in horseback and ended with nuclear fission in bad times there are no customs or limits you just try everything. The depression saw the highest graduation rate and 41% increase in labor productivity because it had to there were no other options. Bad times give meaning and impetus which leads to a posh for success which creates meaning despite suffering.
    - **Tags:** #innovation, #good-enemy-of-great, #bad-times-=-impetus, #inspiring-others, #grow-through-hardship, #positioning-is-vital, #motivation-from-hardship, #fight-for-happiness
    - **Note:** Bad times lower the barriers for innovation and raise the motivation for it. When we’re in a bad position we push ourselves and strive for more that we wouldn’t do when we’re content. Good is the enemy of great bad is a motivator. Bad times are an impetus.
- Too Much, Too Soon, Too Fast: A good idea on steroids quickly becomes a terrible idea. / 02:44:24
  Mon, Nov 13 | 7:23:40 AM
  Scale is important some things can only exist at certain scales like leaders or company strategy same with investing time horizons stock market goes up 50% of days but 88% of times over 10 years. We need to understand scale and time horizon and match them. Growing too fast can lead to fragilities growing too slow can lead to death so you need to understand proper scaling factors.
    - **Tags:** #time-horizon, #long/short-term-incentive-misalignment, #games-(understand-the-game-you-are-playing), #scale, #golden-mean
    - **Note:** Matching scale and time Verizon is vital understand the game you’re playing and play it the right way
- Calm Plants the Seeds of Crazy: Crazy doesn't mean broken. Crazy is normal; beyond the point of crazy is normal. / 02:18:08
  Sun, Nov 12 | 5:35:51 PM
  Seeds of the fall are sown in success and the seeds of success are sown in the fall. Surprise has 6 characteristics incomplete info uncertainty randomness chance unfortunate timing and poor incentives. The idea of the market not to crash leads to higher risk tolerance which creates the instability that will later cause the crash. It’s all cyclical. Calm sows the seed of crazy. The lack of viral death lead to Covid being viewed as terrible because we viewed diseases as dead through vaccines and this we couldn’t cope. Record rain leads to more vegetation growth which leads to more dry kindling and fire. This makes us underestimate things going wrong and the magnitude if wrong buy fear selling greed. Optimism and pessimism always overshoot. Markets keep pushing to the farthest someone will let them go without regard to sanity last buyer. Having enough is power.
    - **Tags:** #randomness, #seeds-of-the-fall-sown-in-success, #cycles-(in-hisotry), #cycles-in-life
    - **Note:** seeds of the fall sown in success. Calm sows the seeds of crazy. Randomness and surprise lead to unclear outcomes. The world is cyclical
- Does Not Compute: The world is driven by forces that cannot be measured. / 02:00:43
  Sun, Nov 12 | 5:19:55 PM
  Sometimes things that don’t make sense are the most important just because you can’t measure something doesn’t mean it doesn’t matter. Often what we can’t conceptualize or measure like others emotions drives the outcomes. The battle of the bulge was so bad because it was irrational to mount an attack from hitlers position from the Allies point of view so so many died because they couldn’t quantify how crazy he was. You can’t measure the intangibles and these drive outcomes fundamental value vs speculative value. Don’t think there should always be a real answer embracing life’s absurdity is a key tenant of success. The world isn’t one big spreadsheet. What’s rational to one person is crazy to another people have different goals and time horizons.
    - **Tags:** #most-things-are-perspective, #intangibles-(have-immense-value), #rationality, #perspective-taking, #goodhart's-law
    - **Note:** Everything makes sense to different people from different perspectives and what you cant measure drives outcomes. Intangibles matter rationality doesnt rule the world and often what is rational is a matter of perspective. Anti-goodharts law
- Best Story Wins: Stories are always more powerful than statistics. / 01:37:24
  Sun, Nov 12 | 5:06:15 PM
  Humans are built on telling good stores need to combine great stories with deep truth. If you’re a bad story teller you can’t get your message across. Great stories are the key to inspiring humans. Best story wins if you can recap existing facts in a new compelling story you’ll win even if it’s nothing new just a survey of agreed upon facts. This is sapiens it’s nothing new just a great story. Humans are just the stories we tell ourselves. Great stories create leverage
    - **Tags:** #stories-we-tell-ourselves, #leverage-points, #storytelling-(power-of), #control-the-narrative
    - **Note:** good stories create leverage humans are the stories we tell ourselves and the best story tellers create the most leverage over time.
- Wild Numbers: People don't want accuracy. They want certainty. / 01:17:13
  Sun, Nov 12 | 10:29:51 AM
  We crave certainty and live in an uncertain world and 10% likelihood events happen 10 out of 100 times. We don’t think probabilistically we crave certainty and with a large enough sample crazy things happen pretty often think birthday paradox but scaled to 100mm people. One in a million event happens to 8000 people a day. So many events and interactions that tail events happen every day and in a global world we see and experience this stuff often and the interactions of people make connections higher. Pessimism is seductive and spreads faster than optimism. We’re seeing more negative stuff because that sells. We hate and actively avoid uncertainty we crave certainty. Some events are very rare which makes them wicked learning environments and this very hard to predict 7 recessions in 50 years so hard to assign realistic probabilities every year.
    - **Tags:** #pessamism-(sounds-smart), #law-of-large-numbers, #base-rates, #luck-vs-skill, #learning-enviornments-(wicked), #certainty-vs-lottery, #probabilitic-thinking, #tail-risk, #violence-drugs-+-sex-sells, #learning-enviornments-(quick+good-feedback), #rare-events-happen-every-day
    - **Note:** People crave certainty in a probablistic world and in our global world tail events happen every day. We see this stuff too because of global news that pushes rare and negative events. Some learning environments are wicked and things happen once a decade so predicting those things be mindful of how hard they are.
      Large numbers + probablistic world = rare events.
- Wild Minds: People who think about the world in unique ways you like also think about the world in unique ways you won't like. / 01:07:05
  Sat, Nov 11 | 7:07:12 PM
  Unique minds have both unique good and bad characteristics that people would love to have like a genius mind but things they don’t want like no social skills what makes them great in one area makes them maladapted in the other and you can’t pick and choose parts of peoples lives you need to take the full package as is which given how divergent divergent thinkers are may not be all that good. People abnormal good at one thing are abnormal bad at other things. Great people are often and have to be crazy. Crazy people take crazy risks so they’re more likely to take moonshots and blow up amazingly. So choose your role models carefully choose your whole life role model.
    - **Tags:** #crazy-ideas-(are-worth-entertaining), #whole-person-(not-pick-best-parts), #trade-offs
    - **Note:** You cannot pick and choose parts of people's lives you need to accept the wholistic thing or none at all. Crazy people have amazing qualities but clear trade offs, so we need to be clear about the choices we are making.
- Expectations and Reality: The first rule of happiness is low expectations. / 00:42:27
  Sat, Nov 11 | 6:58:35 PM
  We can never have enough. The world continues to get better but we never get happier because we gague our present state as relative. World driven by envy not greed. Expectations drive happiness not actual objective circumstances everything we view is relative not absolute. Some people see warm food every day as happiness but billionaires don’t have enough. We’d rather have less of everyone has less no social pressure to increase expectations over income. People felt better off so they were better off. Mimetic desire and envy drive the world transcend paradigms and forget external locus of control. Have an internal locus of control everything is relative. Happiness relies on expectations completely but we pay little attention to managing these. Set reasonable expectations. We can control expectations not circumstances.
    - **Tags:** #live-according-to-opinion-=-unhappiness, #happiness-(internal-not-external), #absolute-standards, #relativity, #keeping-up-with-jones, #internal-locus-of-control, #have-enough
    - **Note:** Having enough can be a blessing most people want to keep up with the jones but that’s relative state. We need to keep absolute states an internal locus of control. It doesn’t matter what others think if you live according to opinions you’ll always be poor
- Risk Is What You Don't See: We are very good at predicting the future, except for the surprises: which tend to be all that matter. / 00:26:30
  Sat, Nov 11 | 6:46:39 PM
  Risk is what you don’t see were good at predicting most things except far tail events and these tail events drive all outcomes or power law outcomes. So we predict everything except the most important consequential stuff. Risk is what’s left over after you plan for everything you see. It’s what you don’t see. Nobody predicted the Great Depression. We have bad foresight for tail risks and believe too much in hindsight bias. There is never more or less economic uncertainty just changes in how ignorant people are to uncertainty. You can never know the biggest risks. Most important risks can never be known in the next 10 years. Our view of tail risks even in the moment is near impossible. Our ignorance of our ignorance is so great. You can forecast risk so make sure you prepare yourself for an uncertain future as best as possible. So save too much and take on a little less debt. Sometimes over planners make so many plans but this is a false sense of security. What you don’t see is your biggest risk.
    - **Tags:** #risk-and-return, #risk-=-what-you-dont-see, #hindsight-bias, #antifragile, #power-law, #tail-risk, #ignorant-of-our-ignorance, #black-swans, #prepare-for-a-crisis-(stoics), #uncertainty
    - **Note:** Risk is what you don't see tail events and power laws drive outcomes. Too much hindsight bias. You can never know the biggest risks were ignorant of out ignorance and we need to prepare for an uncertain future as best as we can. Be antifragile to shocks
- Hanging by a Thread: If you know where we've been, you realize we have no idea where we're going. / 00:18:40
  Sat, Nov 11 | 6:35:45 PM
  The world is hanging by more of a thread than we even recognize Morgan’s 2 friends died in an avalanche he skied the mountain once they did twice there was no reason he didn’t go again but it saved his life. Every current event is handing by a thread with a crazy chain of events that could’ve pushed major events the other day. If the wind was blowing a different direction Washington would’ve lost his entire army and died in one of the first battles of the revolution a failed assassination attempt barely missed fdr and his opponent was very anti new deal and on and on with everything in life. Everything hangs by a thread and events are part dependent compound in crazy ways and is tough near impossible to be predicted so focus on things in human nature that don’t change. Each events make prediction more difficult open your mind to crazy ideas and random change.
    - **Tags:** #path-dependence, #probabilitic-thinking
    - **Note:** Everything is highly probabilistic and path dependent, and we just need to go with the flow
