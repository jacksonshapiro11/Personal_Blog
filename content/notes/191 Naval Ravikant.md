### Highlights

- Neval's unique life philosophy and its impact
  Summary:
  Neval is praised for being unique and unconventional in his life, family dynamics, and entrepreneurial success.
  His approach is seen as a conscious choice to stand out from the crowd. The speaker values reading biographies as a way to internalize someone's life philosophy and views Neval as someone whose ideas can be borrowed and applied in various aspects of life.
  Neval's ability to offer interesting ideas that can be adapted to different situations is highlighted as a key reason for the speaker's interest in his work.

  I don't know, like, i discovered it on my space, that's how long igo it was. So, i don't know, 15 years ago. Ta, maybe even longerhan, that. And i've listened to his podcass and was really wild.
  Speaker 1
  As he's included, he's linked to founders multiple times in his news letter, which is amazing, cause ig, a lot of listeners found this podcast that way, and they turned into subscribers. So it's really wild, considering how much i followed his work.
  Speaker 2
  Ah, but this is what he's talking about.
  Speaker 1
  So he's writing this forward. He starts of to saying, ha, less en, i don't write forwards. I get asked this so much. Ik, i just can't do thit.
  Speaker 2
  But neval's one of his favourite people. So 's going topullt a couple hilats heare for you. Ah, he's bing neval. And what he likes about him he is rarely part of any consensus. And the uniqueness of his life, life style, family dynamics and start up success is a reflection of conscious choices that he made to do things differently. So i think of reading a biography as downloading somebody's life philosophy.
  Speaker 1
  And when you do that, you can take the parts that you like and combine it with other parts to create something completely unique. And then you have your own losophy. And that's really why, why i wanted to read this book. I've followed the all forever. I've seen him speak in person. I've listened to his i've listened tohim on podcast. He just has a lot of interesting ideas that i think, you know, you you just grab and then you can apply to him whatever, whatever you're doing.

    - **Note:** Biography is learning someone’s life philosophy so you can help apply it to shape yours. Success is about finding your unique differentiation that provides you leverage within the society you live in. Figure out what you love and how to do it every day. Most important thing to do if you don’t know what you want. Figure that out first. Seek wealth not status. You can’t get rich renting out your time and repeat your core message often. Repetition is persuasive. Arm yourself with specific knowledge you can’t be trained for. Long term games with long term people. In the long term everything compounds do pursue your genuine curiosity. Work that feels like play. Buffet enjoys reading 500 page shareholder letters. Take accountability and risk under your own name. Internet provide infinite leverage. Code is permissionless leverage while work and education are permissioned leverage. Focus on permissioess. Set your personal hourly rate and never work for less. Could take a decade to figure out what you can uniquely provide. Find specific knowledge that’s baked into your identity. Find out who you are then do that.
- The Best Jobs Are
  Summary:
  The best jobs are creative expressions of continuous learners in free markets.
  The key to success is not copying the 'what' but understanding the 'how'. By building and marketing something that reflects who you are, you create a unique offering that no one can compete with.
  Successful individuals continuously learn and adapt, embracing creativity in an ever-evolving market.

  It's the best windows application ever, anybody ever built. But anyways, he's sang, ha, you know it. You'reselling cides. It's a large part of your business. Itunes, a combination of ye tunes and ipod, which is what he was showing jeff a it's going, you know, you're going to essentially, your goingto be selling antiques. And so there's a lot of people pressuring other businesses, such as amazon, that jump in and make another m p three player, start selling other digital forms of music. And jeff's like, i'm not doing that, because i'm not going to out compete apple by being. I can't out apple apple, right? But what he did, he didn't copye. What he copied the how. And it blew my freak and mine and ever put this together, and i had the very first, i've had kindles for ever, right?
  Speaker 2
  And what i realize is that jeff bazos took steve jobson, apple's ideas for the digitation of music with using the combination of itunes and the ipod, and applied them to the digitization Of reading with the kindle. And it says that explicitly in that book, and i never made the connection of my own was still, again, think about reducing that idea, don't copy the what, copy the how. Going back to this, if you are fundamentally building and marketing something that is an extension of who you are, no one can compete with you on that.
  Speaker 1
  The best jobs are neither a now, this is moving on to a different section. Just a it happens to beon the next page.
  Speaker 2
  The best jobs are neither decreed nor degreed.
  Speaker 1
  They are creative expressions of con tinous learners in free markets. That is amazing sentence there. They are creative expressions of continuous learners in free markets. The most inspor important skill for getting rich is becoming a perpetual learner. ([Time 0:28:39](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3bb0bb1d-ea87-41f6-a9a9-0743b158bd09))
    - **Note:** Don’t copy the what but copy the how. The best jobs are not decreed nor degrees but the creative expression of continuous learners in free markets. Be a learning machine. Deliver what society wants but they don’t know they want you can’t get rich without owning equity. Optimize not for pay but independence and control. Give your life freedom over all. Credibility helps provide you with infinite leverage. Being at the extreme in your art is very important in the age of leverage. Big 3 decision who you’re with where you live and what you do. Spend a lot of time making these decisions. Your resume is just a catalog of your own suffering. Companies are selling the results of their trial and error. There is no short cut to good judgement. Master the basics don’t try to do complex things just rather do the simple things. The complex things aren’t proven so master the basics above all. Talent is found around non conformists misfits and rebels. Generally people who have to think for themselves.

  Having a support system in place can significantly aid in coping with difficult times. Building resilience through self-care practices and positive coping strategies is crucial for maintaining mental health.

  Speaker 1
  Really interesting for me to be honest. I don't, or really important for me to be honest. I don't go out of my way volunteering negative or nasty things. I would combine radical honesty with an old, wool, worn buffet has, which is praise specifically criticized generally. I try to follow this. I don't always follow it, but I think I've followed enough to have made a difference in my life. I know I love myself on this next section. Repetition is persuasive, which I've also repeated over a note again. Decision making is everything. I think people have a hard time understanding a fundamental fact of leverage. If I manage a billion dollars and I'm right 10% more often than somebody else, my decision making creates a $100 million worth of value on a judgment call. With modern technology and large workforces in capital, our decisions are leveraged more and more. If you can be right, more, if you can be more, if you can be more right and more rational, you're going to get nonlinear returns in your life. And then skipping, I skipped a little bit, but this is just a tweet and this is something I've noticed over and over again, that the people that we study on this podcast, the greatest entrepreneurs In history are really not into diversification. It's completely, they're advised to you if you were reading their biographies and autobiographies. It's completely different to what you'd get for normal advice, right? For everyday people, non-missfits. And I think the vol ([Time 0:44:04](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7b6495d6-85df-4141-94e9-72e5aec6ef5f))
    - **Note:** The more you know the less you should diversify. Everything magnifies with leverage being 10% more right on a billion is 100mm. Collect mental models and read biography. Mental models are compact ways to recall complex ideas easily. Inversion or trying not to be stupid. Most of success is not making mistakes and let it compound. Choose hell yes or no if your unclear in big decisions don’t do it. Embrace short term pain because it usually leads to long term benefits. Embrace the suck it’s probably a better path and your brain is just scared to go that way. Suffer in the short term to get paid in the long term. The learning is abundant the desire to learn right now is scarce and the more learning the more leverage you have so read a lot. Time is the best filter for knowledge the lindy effect. Calm mind fit body and happy relationships can’t be bought. Wealth health then happiness is what we do but we should pursue it in the opposite order.
- The Inner Scorecard Is All That Matters

  Of books. Two great thoughts. The first one, a calm mind, a fit body, and a house full of love. These things cannot be bought. They must be earned. And number two, the three big ones in life are wealth, health, and happiness. We pursue them in that order, but their importance is a reverse. So our default is go after wealth, then health and happiness. He's saying it's better to go after happiness, then health, then wealth. Just a random paragraph for you. My summary, this is building a life that is uniquely perfect to you. This is kind of this paragraph that that the ball has here is going to echo what I feel I learned from at Thorpe. To me, the real winners are the ones who step out of the game entirely, who don't even play the game, who rise above it. Those are the people who have such internal, mental, and self-control and self-awareness that they need nothing from anybody else. This is another idea that you and I have talked about over and over again. This idea we learned all the way back on Founders Number 100, but the first biography of Buffett I did, the inner scorecard, the outer scorecard, the inner scorecard is all that matters. Really try to reorient yourself around having an inner scorecard, which means as long as you're comfortable with the decision you're making, you're doing what you feel is right. You're going to be comfortable to be misunderstood ([Time 0:55:29](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4ac3fe88-4e6e-4b7e-988f-1f11767107dc))
    - **Note:** Inner vs outter scorecard important to transcend and rise above the paradigms in society. Life is a single player game. Focus on yourself and what you do don’t worry about what others think.
- How to Be Happy

  Speaker 1
  In this section, he's asked a question, but that doesn't say by who. Buffett has a great example when he asks if you want to be the world's best lover and known as the worst, are the world's worst-level lover and known as the best, in reference to an inner Or external scorecard. All the real scorecards are internal. I've got a few notes on this page. Number one, how to develop skills. Number two, we are only what we do, not what we say. We are, that's a quote from Izzy Sharp, the founder of Four Seasons. This is an entire chapter in happiness. He says, and it can be cultivated. It's a skill. The most important trick to be happy is to realize happiness is the skill you develop and the choice you make. You choose to be happy and you work at it. It's just like building muscles. It's just like losing weight. It's just like succeeding at your job. It's just like learning calculus. You descend this is how to develop skills. He summarizes this fantastically here. You decide it's important to you. You prioritize it above everything else and you read everything on the topic. There's a lot of random thoughts and maxims in the book. Here's one, no exceptions. All screen activities are linked to less happiness. All non-screen activities link to more happiness. My own life I've been thinking of telling friends and other people, I've just become suspicious ([Time 0:57:15](https://share.snipd.com/snip/869c5086-5360-4a4b-bbfd-e39af3d2cb63))
    - **Note:** Happiness is a skill you develop and choice you make. Screen time is bad for happiness. Decide it’s important to you and study it like calculus. Suffer for a few not many things. Life is a game and you need to treat it that way it’s fleeting enjoy it don’t take it too seriously. You need to take agency and save yourself no one can save you or is responsible to do so. Build things that fit you don’t conform your life to the way of others you’ll fail. You need to be irrationally obsessed to succeed. Master the fundamentals fight residence a lot can change in a lifetime. Most of our world is avoiding distraction. Be present desire is suffering if you won’t work with someone for a lifetime don’t for a day. Anger is hot coal you hold in your hands waiting to throw it at someone else. Reading and learning is the ultimate meta skill all benefits come from compounding. Earn with your mind not your time. 99% of effort is waisted. Praise specifically criticize generally. Be honest abs positive. Truth has predictive power. Greatness comes from suffering. Watch every thought. Love is given not recieved. Enlightenment is the space in between thoughts. Each moment needs to be complete in it if itself. Health love and your mission in life nothing else matters.
