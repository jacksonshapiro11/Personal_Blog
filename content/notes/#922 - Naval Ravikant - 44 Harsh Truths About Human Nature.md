### Highlights

- **Suffering and the Journey of Life**
  * Suffering is primarily mental anguish arising from not wanting to do a task. 
  * Successful individuals often regret not enjoying the journey more and recognize the optional nature of their suffering.
  * Reflect on past experiences without the benefit of hindsight, focusing on temperament and age-related experience, to identify ways to reduce anger and emotional turmoil. Go back 10 years what would you want to change. 
  * Aim to perform tasks peacefully or happily to enhance effectiveness.
  * Success is fleeting; humans quickly adapt to achievements, returning to a cycle of boredom and desire.
  * Money solves financial problems and is good to have, but happiness is not guaranteed, as studies suggest lottery winners return to their baseline happiness.

  Naval Ravikant
  If you define pain as physical pain, then it's a real thing. It happens and you can't ignore it. But that's not what we mean by suffering. Suffering is mostly mental anguish and mental pain. And it just means you don't want to do the task at hand. If you were fine doing the task at hand, then you wouldn't be suffering. And then the question is, what's more effective to suffer along the way or just to interpret it in a way that it's not suffering? You hear from a lot of successful people, they look back and they say, oh, the journey was a fun part, right? That was actually the entertaining part, I should have enjoyed it more. It's a common regret. There's a little thought exercise I like to do, which is you can go back into your own life and try to put yourself in the exact position you were in five years ago, 10 years ago, 15 years Ago, 20 years ago. And you try to remember, okay, who was I with? What was I doing? What was I feeling? What were my emotions? What were my objectives? And really, really try to transport yourself back and see if there's any advice you'd give yourself, anything you'd do differently. Now, you don't have new information. Don't pretend you could have gone back and, you know, bought a stock or bought Bitcoin or whatever. But just knowing what you know now in terms of your temperament and a little bit of age-related experience, how would you have done things differently? And I think it's a worthwhile exercise to do, so don't let me rob you of the conclusion. But I'll tell you for me, I would have done everything the same, except I would have done it with less anger, less emotion, less internal suffering. Because that was optional. It wasn't necessary. And I would argue that someone who can do the job at least peacefully, but maybe happily, is going to be more effective than someone who has unnecessary emotional turmoil.
  Chris Williamson
  Well, you end up with a series of miserable successes, right?
  Naval Ravikant
  The outcome may have been the same, but the entire experience of getting there. And the journey is not only the reward, the journey is the only thing there is. Even success, it's human nature to bank it very, very quickly. Because the normal loop that we run through is you sit around, you're bored, then you want something. Then when you want something, you decide you're not going to be happy until you get that thing. Then you start your bout of suffering or anticipation while you strive to get that thing If you get that thing, then you get used to it. And then you get bored again. Then a few months later, you want something else. And if you don't get it, then you're unhappy for a bit. And then you get over it and then you want something else, right? That's the normal cycle. So whether you're happy or unhappy at the end, it tends not to last. Now, I don't want to be glib and say that, oh, there's no point in making money or being successful. There absolutely is. Money solves all your money problems. So it is good to have money. That said, there are those stories. I don't know if you've seen those studies. I don't know how real these are. A lot of these psych studies don't replicate, but it's a fun little study that shows that people who break their back and people who win the lottery are back to their baseline happiness ([Time 0:04:15](https://share.snipd.com/snip/510ee899-33d3-4496-be25-1785514a5780))
- **Authenticity**
  - The world lacks authenticity because people want to be something they're not. This leads to saying things they don't believe.
  - Don't lie to elevate your status because you'll trap yourself in a hall of mirrors and ultimately impress nobody.
  Transcript:
  Naval Ravikant
  And I think people can smell that. What this world really lacks right now is authenticity because everybody wants something. They want to be seen as something. They want to be something that they're not. And so you do catch a lot of people saying things that they don't really believe. And I think people are very sensitive to that.
  Chris Williamson
  Radars have become hypersensitized to try and work out whether or not this person means the thing that they're saying. Yeah.
  Naval Ravikant
  I mean, a lot of people are wrong. Most of us are wrong most of the time, especially in any new endeavor. Difference between being wrong and disingenuous though. Purposefully wrong. Correct. Exactly. So I think that's the big difference. If someone is wrong, no big deal, as long as they have a genuine reason for saying what they're saying or believing what they're believing. But if they are lying to elevate their status or their appearance or to live up to some expectation, that's the mistake. And that's a mistake not just for the listener, it's a mistake for themselves, because then you're going to get trapped in a hall of mirrors. You yourself are going to be consistent with your past proclamation. So if you're lying to others, you're going to be lying to yourself. You're puppeted by a person that you are not even. That's right. Yeah. It's like, what was that line? You're basically trying to impress people who don't care about you. They don't like the real you.
  Chris Williamson
  And if they saw the real you, they wouldn't care. And the people who would like the real you don't get to see the real you, so they pass you by. Right.
  Naval Ravikant

- **Building Self-Esteem**
  * Increase self-esteem by living up to your own moral code and rigorously following it. 
  * Express love through sacrifice and duty, even if you don't feel loved.
  * The worst outcome is low self esteem and not living up to your expectations
  Transcript:
  Chris Williamson
  The worst outcome in the world is not having self-esteem. Why?
  Naval Ravikant
  Yeah, it's a tough one. I look at the people, and I don't want to offend anybody, but I look at the people who don't like themselves, and that's the toughest slot, because they're always wrestling with themselves, And it's hard enough to face the outside world. And no one's going to like you more than you like yourself. So if you're struggling with yourself, then the outside world becomes an insurmountable challenge. And it's hard to say why people have low self-esteem. It might be genetic, it might just be circumstantial. A lot of times I think it's because they just weren't unconditionally loved as a child. And that sort of seeps in at a deep core level. But self-esteem issues can be the most limiting. One interesting thought is that, you know, to some extent, self-esteem is a reputation you have with yourself. You're watching yourself at all times. You know what you're doing and you have your own moral code. Everyone has a different moral code. But if you don't live up to your own moral code, the same code that you hold others to, it will damage your self-esteem. So one way to build up your self-esteem is to live up to your own code, very rigorously have one and then live up to it. My life and you know what are the moments that i'm actually proud of there's very far and few between and it's not that often it's not the things you would expect it's not the material success It's not having learned this thing or that it's when i made a sacrifice for somebody or something that i loved and uh that's when i'm actually ironically most proud now that's through An explicit mental exercise but i'll bet you at some level i'm recording that implicitly so that tells me that even if i am not being loved then the way to create love is to give love, to Express love through sacrifice and through duty. And so I think doing things like that can build up your self-esteem really fast. ([Time 0:21:02](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d6391129-0ece-4d12-ab51-55c1f5fa975f))
- **Willingness to Start Over**
  * Great artists and entrepreneurs can always start over, like Elon Musk, who risked his PayPal fortune on SpaceX and Tesla.
  * Many people become stuck after success, while creating something great requires a willingness to return to zero.
  * They tie their self concept to their identity and what they did which limits growth and progress forget the past re underwrite beliefs constantly to be dynamic and grow.
  Transcript:
  Naval Ravikant
  But even the great entrepreneurs, they're just always willing to start over. I'm always struck by the Elon Musk story where, you know, he did PayPal as x.com originally, actually, it was his financial institution that got merged into PayPal. It's good that you've got the domain, you know what I mean? Yeah, exactly. I'll park that, I'll hold on to it. He's consistent, he's been using it for quite a while. And he said something like along the lines of uh i made 200 million dollars from the sale of paypal i put 100 million dollars into spacex 80 million tesla 20 in the solar city and i had to Borrow money for rent right this guy is a perennial risk taker he's always willing to start over he doesn't have any pride about being seen as successful as being seen as a failure he's Willing to put it all in the line. He'll back himself again each time. He'll back himself again each time. But the key thing is he's always willing to start over, right? Even now when he's sort of made his new startup is a USA, right? He's basically trying to fix it like he would fix one of his startups. And I think that is a willingness to look like a fool and that is a willingness to start over. And a lot of people just don't have that. They become successful or they become rich or they become famous and that's it. They're stuck. They don't want to go back to zero. And creating anything great requires zero to one. And that means you go back to zero. And that's really painful and hard to do.
  Chris Williamson
  Talking about risk, something I've been thinking about a lot to do with you. Any moment when you're not having a good time, when you're not really happy, you're not doing anyone any favors. I think lots of people have become unusually familiar with suffering silently in that sort of a way of not having a high ([Time 0:31:04](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4416587b-a49e-4a35-8ae5-96b62e430724))
- **Problem Selection and Focus**
  * Focus on solving one overarching problem at a time to increase your chances of success.
  * Recognize that problems are often created mentally through judgments and reactions.
  * Consciously choose which problems to engage with, directing your mental energy effectively.
  * Avoid doom-surfing and getting caught up in problems you can't control; step away from excessive news consumption.
  * Prioritize fixing your own life and family before attempting to solve the world's problems.
  * Define success concretely, focusing on getting what you want and wanting the right things (not booby prizes).
  * Focus on 1 problem think hard choose it wisely and want something possible don’t focus on 15 things and want to be 10 feet tall.
  Transcript:
  Naval Ravikant
  Again, I would say try to focus on just one overarching problem and then go solve that problem. It's like if you want to be successful, define success very concretely, focus on that and everything else. When it enters your mind, it becomes a problem, whether it's a judgment about the girl walking down the street or the car that just cut in front of you, or whether it's like, you know, this, Your accountant did this stupid thing. Like, yes, it's going to trigger you, but observe for a moment that like, it's triggering me. I've created a problem. Do I really want to have this problem right now do i want to spend the energy on this problem or do i want that going somewhere else and it doesn't have to be that over you don't have to the
  Chris Williamson
  Mind mud wrestling with itself is also a problem because i'd love to do that i have my problems have got problems and i have a real problem about fixing my problems yeah exactly so you just
  Naval Ravikant
  You're going to be much happier and much more focused again I think happiness and focus and success can kind of complement each other. You're going to have much more energy. Just think about it as mental energy. You're going to have much more mental energy to focus on the actual problems you want to solve if you don't start unconsciously, subconsciously, reactively picking up problems everywhere. So before anything can be a problem that takes up your emotional energy, you have to accept it as a problem. You can be choosy about your problems. And I'm not saying I'm perfect in that regard, but I think I'm better than I used to be.
  Chris Williamson
  Well, lots of people are addicted to solving problems, so much so that sometimes people create problems when we don't have any simply so that we can solve them.
  Naval Ravikant
  We have that going on. And then even worse is we take on problems that we can't affect. So, you know, another one of my little quips was, you know, a rational person can sort of, a rational person should cultivate indifference to things that are out of their control, right? Or a rational person can find peace by cultivating indifference to things that are out of their control. And I'm as guilty as anybody of doom surfing on X or social media and getting worked up about things that I can't do anything about, right? Like, do I want to be fighting those battles in my mind when I literally cannot do anything about it? So if you find yourself looping on a problem, like you're watching the news too much and you're getting caught up in a problem you can't do anything about, you have to step away from that. And modern media is a delivery mechanism for mimetic viruses. And what's happened now is, you know, 100 years ago, 500 years ago, if something wasn't happening in your immediate vicinity, you wouldn't hear about it. It wouldn't be a problem for you. But now every single one of the world's problems has turned into a mimetic virus, which is going into the battlefield of the news and is trying to infect your mind in real time. Hyperspeak. Yeah, so that you become obsessed with the war in Ukraine, which is really far away, or you get obsessed with climate change, or you get obsessed with AI doom, or you get obsessed with Whatever. And there's nothing as riveting as the old religion, the world is ending, the world is ending, pay attention, the world is ending. And if you don't... It's like Cassandra complex at global scale. Cassandra complex at global scale. And I would argue that large percentages of the population are essentially just infected with these mimetic viruses that have taken over their brain, and are causing them to do incredible Gyration about things that probably aren't even true or are greatly exaggerated. But even to the extent they are true, they're things that that person can do nothing about. And they should put their own house in order first. So, you know, another little line I have for myself is your family is broken, but you're going to fix the world, right? People are running out there to try and fix the world when their own lives are a mess, right? And I think it defies credibility if you can't fix your own life first. I'm not going to take you seriously if you can't fix your own life. Like all these philosophers who, you know, seem like people you emulate and so smart or like these brilliant celebrities and they go off and commit suicide. Well, you just kind of invalidated your whole way of life it's like that line of in no country for all men where the killer is waiting for the protagonist and protagonist shows up and the Killer says well you know if your set of rules brought you here then what good are your rules didn't work um i i am self i'm holistically selfish in in that i want to be objectively successful In everything i set out to want. Yeah. You have one life, don't settle for mediocrity. Don't settle for mediocrity. And I think the only, like people debate intelligence, for example, right? We talk about IQ tests and all that. But I think the only true test of intelligence is if you get what you want out of life. And there are two parts to that. One is getting what you want, so you know how to get it. And the second is wanting the right things, knowing what to want in the first place. I could want to be a six foot eight basketball player and I'm not going to get that. So it's wanting the wrong thing. So it's wanting something that you can't get. That's wanting something you can't get. It's also wanting something that you don't want. Yeah. Wanting something that's a booby prize. There are plenty of booby prizes out there too, right? I haven't heard that word in about 20 years. Yeah, prizes that are just not worth having or that create their own problems. ([Time 0:51:37](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ff611fe0-5ff6-4391-8d11-c7969de518cc))
- **Optimism and Adaptation**
  * Modern society is safer and offers nonlinear upside, so override the hardwired pessimism.
  * Don't define yourself with labels, adapt to the ever-changing reality to see things clearly.
  * Be optimistic not pessimistic
  * Think proportional to your problem if you commit to something for 5 years think about it for more than a day. 
  * Learning is about constant repetition maybe not 10k hours but 10k reps. 
  * Dont care about things that don’t effect you problems out of your scope like war in Ukraine. 
  * Dont have strong labels for yourself like optimist and pessimist remain flexible
  Transcript:
  Chris Williamson
  Don't partner with cynics and pessimists. You mentioned there about the people who've got a nightmare going on at home and are trying to fix the world. But a lot of the time that cynicism and pessimism, we find in ourselves. We see the world, whether we want to, whether it's because we've imbibed what the news or the negative people around us have said, or it's a bit more kind of endogenous than that. It's just sort of in us. It's the way that we see the world. How can people avoid cynicism and pessimism within themselves?
  Naval Ravikant
  Yeah, cynicism and pessimism is a tough one. We're naturally hardwired for it. Again, I go back to evolution. I'm sorry to keep harping on evolution, but within biology, there's very few good explanatory theories. And theory of evolution by natural selection is probably the best one. So if you can't explain something about life or psychology or human nature through evolution, then you probably don't have a good theory for it. And I would say that pessimism is another one that comes out of this, which is in the natural environment, you're hardwired to be pessimistic. Because let's say that I see something rustling in the woods, and if I move towards it and it turns out to be food and prey, then good, I get to eat one meal. But if it turns out to be a predator, I get eaten. And that's the end of that. So we are hardwired to avoid ruin and just dying. So we are naturally hardwired to be pessimists. But modern society is very different. Despite whatever problems you may have with modern society, it is far, far safer than living in the jungle and just trying to survive. And the opportunities and the upside are nonlinear. For example, when you're investing, if you short a stock, the most money you can make is 2x. If the stock goes to zero, you double your money. But if the stock is the next NVIDIA and it goes 100x or 1,000x, you make a lot of money. So upside because of leverage is nearly unlimited. Also in modern society, because there's so many different people you can interact with, if you go on a date and it fails, there are infinite more people to go on a date with. In a tribal system, there might've been 20 people and you can't even get through all of them. So modern society is far more forgiving of failure. And you just have to sort of neocortically realize and override that. You have to realize that you're much more running a search function to find the thing that'll work and then that one thing will pay off in massive compounding once you find your mate for The rest of your life you find your wife or your husband then you can compound in that relationship it's okay if you had 50 failed dates in between the same way once you find the one business You're meant to plow into and it'll compound returns it's okay if you had 50 small failed ventures, or 50 small failed job interviews. The number of failures doesn't matter. And so there's no point in being a pessimist. You want to be an optimist, but I would say you want to be skeptical about specific things. Every specific opportunity is probably a fail, but you want to be optimistic in the general. In the general, you want to be like something in here is going to work out. How do you navigate that tension? I mean, exactly as I said, I'm optimistic in the general that if something fails right now, then this is a little woo-woo, but it wasn't meant to be. It was a learning experience. It was an iteration. As long as I learned something from it, then it's a win. If I didn't learn from it, then it's a loss. But as long as you're learning and you keep iterating fast and cutting your losses quickly, then when you find the right thing, you have to be optimistic and compound into it. So you don't want to jump into the first thing. You don't want to marry the first person you date necessarily, unless you got very lucky. But you want to investigate and explore very, very quickly until you find the match. And then you have to be willing to go all in. You have to be willing to move your chips at the center of the table.
  Chris Williamson
  So both those approaches are required. So it's a barbell strategy. It's sort of black or it's white. And most people are sort of stuck in this gray bit. I'm like half in, but I'm kind of don't really know if I am. I also think like labels like pessimists, optimists, cynics, introverts, extroverts, these are very self-limiting.
  Naval Ravikant
  Humans are very dynamic. There are times when you feel like being introverted. There are times when you feel like being extroverted. There are contexts in which you'll be pessimistic. There are contexts in which you'll be optimistic. Leave all those labels alone. It's better just to look at the problem at hand, look at reality the way it is. Try to take yourself out of the equation in a sense. Like, obviously, you're involved, but motivated reasoning is the worst kind of reasoning. You're not going to find truth through highly motivated reasoning. You have to be objective, and objective means trying to take yourself out of it as much as possible, or at least your personality out of it as much as possible. And so to the extent you run with this thick identity and personality, it's going to cloud your judgment. It's going to try and lock you into the past. If you say, I'm a depressed, unhappy person, yeah, I'm going to be unhappy. That's a way of locking yourself into your past. Even saying, I have trauma, I have PTSD. Yeah, you feel something. There are memories, there are flashes, there are occasional bad feelings, but don't define yourself by it because then you'll lock it into your identity and you're just going to loop On it. It's better to stay flexible because reality is always changing and you have to be able to adapt to it. Adaptation is also intelligence. Adaptation is survival. Adaptation is kind of how you're here. You're here because you're an adapter and your ancestors were adapters. So to adapt, you'll see things clearly. And if you're seeing them through your own identity, it's going to cloud your judgment.

- **The Value of Surprise**
  * Some people want to be blissfully happy, but others want to be engaged with the world. They want to be surprised, do things, accomplish things, and get what they want.
  * For insecure overachievers who want control, too much planning and scheduling reduces the capacity for surprise.
  * Balance of surprise and stability.
  Transcript:
  Naval Ravikant
  They want to, you know, just be blissfully happy wherever they are, whenever they are. But I think other people, most people would say, well, I'm here in this world. I'm here in this life. I don't understand it or why, but I want to be, I want to be engaged. I want to be surprised. Want to do things. I want to accomplish things. I want to want things and then get them, right? That's kind of the whole game that we're all playing here.
  Chris Williamson
  Surprises are really interesting. The sort of unpredictability, I think, total bro science here, but I'm pretty sure that that's kind of how dopamine works, that things are a bit better than you expected. That within that, it means that if you, for the perennial insecure overachievers that cloy for control, that ([Time 1:09:55](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f2c330c3-af0c-4b86-83a3-0ba829aa74ee))
- **Ego Obsession and Unhappiness**
  * Anxiety arises when life unfolds exactly as planned, as boredom ensues. 
  * Obsessing over one's personality and ego cultivates depression and unhappiness by strengthening an insatiable inner 'beast'.
  * This 'beast' is a collection of self-obsessed thoughts that are inflexible and create limiting narratives and identities. When we hang on the same problems we just create more problems. 
  * Solve personal problems by reflecting on them briefly to learn then moving on.
  * To find happiness, focus less on yourself by taking on other people's problems or missions. 
  * Anything taken to excess can become detrimental, including causes and religions.
  Transcript:
  Naval Ravikant
  Yeah. If nothing worked out the way you expected, if it was all serendipity and you didn't want that, you would just be a ball of anxiety. On the other hand, if everything worked out as you expected and wanted, you'd be so bored, you might as well be dead. So there's some, you know, the river of life kind of flows between these two banks and enjoy it.
  Chris Williamson
  You say thinking about yourself is the source of all unhappiness, but presumably you need to work on yourself and your weaknesses as well. So some degree of reflection is important. And if thinking about yourself as a source of unhappiness, is this a price that you need to pay? I need to sort of reflect inward. I'm going to have to diminish this level of happiness for a little while, and then I can use this new level. I've got my brown belt on and I can go out into the world as a brown belt.
  Naval Ravikant
  What I'm specifically referring to that is if you're thinking about your personality and your ego and the character of you, and you're obsessing over that, that's where a lot of depression And unhappiness sort of lingers and and gets cultivated uh so uh thinking about woe is me this happened to me that happened to me i have this personality i have this issue i deserve this I didn't get that that's you're just strengthening a little beast in there that is insatiable. And that's where I think a lot of unhappiness comes from. What's the beast? It's the ego, but that word is so overused that I kind of hate to use the word. But it's a recurrent collection of thoughts that are very self-obsessed and will never be satisfied. And very concretized as well. So they're not malleable, not particularly flexible you're just adding to them by thinking about them all the time you're creating narratives and stories and identities but that's Different from solving personal problems so if you encounter something you learn from something you're reflecting upon the learning then you can reflect upon it absorb it and then Just move on but sitting there saying i'm chris i'm nabal i deserve this this happened to me that person wronged me, this is who I am, this shouldn't have happened, I need to go get revenge On this, or I need to fix that or change this. I mean, that I think is where a lot of mental illness comes from. So it depends if you are thinking about something to solve a problem and get it off your chest and get it off your mind. If it leaves your mind clearer at the end of it, then I think it was worthwhile. If it leaves your mind busier at the end of it, then you're probably going in the wrong direction.
  Chris Williamson
  Is this a justification for detachment, cultivated ignorance, distraction?
  Naval Ravikant
  Detachment is not a goal. Detachment is a byproduct. It's just a byproduct of just realizing what matters and what doesn't. And just for one moment on the self thing, I think everybody craves thinking about something more than themselves. If you want to be happy to some extent, you have to forget about your personal problems. And one way to do that is take on other problems, bigger problems. And that could be a mission. That could be spirituality. That could be kids. It could be caring about the planet, although I think people take that a little far, you know, and then they get kind of oppressive and tyrannical in support of abstract concepts. So these can be taken too far, just like religion, for example, just like... Anything in excess. Anything in excess, right? But generally, the less you think about yourself, the more you can think about a mission or about God or about a child or something like that. So I remember Vinny Haimath, the founder of Loom, said, I am rich and I have no idea what ([Time 1:10:58](https://share.snipd.com/snip/411aacf6-6b9c-4ce1-bbea-ad8787bff4c3))
- **Understanding Stress and Anxiety**
  * Stress arises from conflicting desires; resolve them by choosing one, accepting the loss of the other, or deferring the decision.
  * Anxiety is pervasive, resulting from many unresolved stressors; address it by identifying and resolving underlying issues through introspection.
  * Were gonna die and can’t take anything with us so we need to relax and be happy. Understand the end of our life giving us meaning.
  * Wasted time is when you’re not present and doing what you want to your capacity and abilities. Be very present that’s life that’s all there is.
  * Observe and rewrite thoughts. Live on your own terms your authentic life. Trust your gut.

  So anxiety and stress are interesting. They're very related. Stress is when, like if you look at an iron beam, when an iron beam is under stress, it's because it's being bent in two different directions at the same time. So when your mind is under stress, it's because it has two conflicting desires at once. So for example, you know, you want to be liked, but you want to do something selfish and you can't reconcile the two. And so you are under stress. You want to do something for somebody else. You want to do something for yourself, right? These are examples. You don't want to go to work, but you want to make money. So you're under stress, right? So you have two conflicting desires. And I think one of the ways to get through stress is to acknowledge that, oh, I actually have two conflicting desires and either I need to resolve it. I need to pick one and then be okay losing the other, or I will decide later. But at least just being aware of why your stress can help alleviate a lot of stress. And then anxiety, I think, is sort of this pervasive, unidentifiable stress where you're just kind of stressed out all the time and you're not even sure why. And you can't even identify the underlying problem. And reason for that is because you you have so many uh unresolved problems unresolved stress points that are piled up in your life that you can no longer identify what the problems are And there's this mountain of garbage in your mind and it's a little bit of it poking out the top like an iceberg and that's anxiety but underneath there's a lot of unresolved things and So you just need to kind of go through very carefully every time you're anxious like okay why am i anxious this time i don't know why oh well let me sit here and just think about it let me write Down what the possible causes could be let me meditate on it let me journal let me talk to a therapist let me talk to my friends let me just kind of see like when does that stress go away if You can kind of identify and unravel and resolve these issues, then I think that helps get rid of anxiety. A lot of the anxiety is piled up because we move through life too quickly, not observing our own reactions to things. We don't resolve them. So this goes counter to what I was saying earlier about not reflecting too much on things. But you reflect on the problems to observe them and solve them. You don't reflect on them to feel better about yourself. To indulge them. Well, if you're doing it to just feel better about yourself, that could be strengthening your personality and your ego and could be creating a more fragile personality. You know, one big anxiety resolver for me is just ruminating on death. I think that's a good one. You're going to die. It's all going to zero. You cannot take anything with you. And I know this is trite. And I know that we don't spend enough time thinking about the big questions. We kind of give up on them when we're very, very young. You know, a little child might ask the big questions like, why are we here? What's the meaning of life? What is this all about? You know, is there Santa Claus? Is there God? But then as adults, we're taught not to think about these things. We've given up on them. But I think the big questions are the big questions for good reasons. And if you can keep the idea in front of you at all times that you're going to die and that everything goes literally to zero, what's there to stress about?

  Yeah, for better or worse, life is very short. How should people deal with its briefness? Enjoy it.

  Make the best of it. You know, it's even briefer than that. Each moment just disappears. It's gone. There's only a present moment and it's gone instantly. So if you're not there for it, if you're stressed out or you're anxious or you're thinking about something else, you missed it.
