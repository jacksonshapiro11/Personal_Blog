### Highlights

- Short Lessons and Streaks Drive Engagement
  Summary:
  Effective learning applications should prioritize short, digestible lessons, ideally around three minutes, to accommodate users' busy lifestyles.
  This approach allows for learning during brief moments of downtime, making the experience more accessible. Including engaging elements such as progress bars and celebratory animations can enhance user satisfaction.
  Vital engagement strategies incorporate gamification techniques like streak tracking, where users feel motivated to maintain daily activity, significantly increasing retention rates.
  Notifications, when used thoughtfully, can effectively remind users to engage with their learning without overwhelming them.
  Additionally, fostering social interaction through features like leaderboards and collaborative quests can boost motivation. These strategies not only retain existing users but also expand the market by attracting those who previously would not have pursued language learning, particularly in English-speaking countries. Finally, a robust mobile-first design is crucial, reflecting the shift towards mobile usage in the digital landscape, ensuring that learning tools are widely utilized and effective.

  Speaker 1
  I mean, the first thing is 30-minute lessons, no good. You want to do three-minute lessons. So that's the first thing we did. We made them three minutes. That's very important. And even if ultimately people do spend 30 minutes on your app, making each chunk short matters a lot because that means you can do them while you're waiting for the bus or while you're Literally going to the bathroom. 30 minutes is just too long. So you have to be able to chunk them. So we started chunking them. That's important. So we made the lesson experience be something that was quite palatable. Three minutes, there's a progress bar that you get to fill. And then we started adding all kinds of little dopamine hits where like when you get something right, there's like a little explosion. That's kind of one thing. Then over time, we discovered a number of other really important levers. One super important lever has been the streak. So we have a streak. We've had a streak for like 12 years, basically. And the idea is, you know, the standard with a streak, if you use it for seven days in a row, you have a streak of length seven. And if you don't use it on the eighth day, it goes down to zero. So it's just a counter of how many days you've done it in a row. This is super powerful. At this point, we have, I think I'm going to get this number right. I think we have 8 million people who are daily active users who have a streak longer than 365. So we have 8 million daily active users that haven't missed a day in the last year or more. So more than 365. So it's very powerful. Streak is very powerful.
  Speaker 2
  So that's around 8% of your users.
  Speaker 1
  8% of our active users have not missed a day in at least a year. That's very powerful. It really is. Another thing that has been really powerful is notifications. You know, many apps abuse notifications where they just notify you like crazy. It turns out that if you're teaching something to somebody, they're a lot more okay with you sending them notifications because people think, well, this is good for me. So we've taken advantage of that. While we're not spammy, we do send notifications probably at a higher rate than we could if we were not teaching you something. We have a very sophisticated system that tries to figure out. It's an AI system that we've trained over the years that basically tries to figure out when to send you a notification and what to say in it to get you to come back. That has been really successful. And then the other thing that has been pretty successful that we've gotten just a lot better over the last few years is the social component where we have leaderboards. Leaderboards, by the way, there's a whole science of how to do them well. We got them very wrong at the beginning, but we're much better now. So, you know, we have leaderboards, you can have streaks with friends now, you can have quests with friends, et cetera. So that has helped out a lot.
  Speaker 2
  And we should say this notion of gamification, I mean, this was like a real hot word, 20, call it 12 to 15. Yeah. And you started the company in 2011. So you were kind of blazing the trail on a lot of these things. The idea that you could bring game mechanics to non-game experiences. It's pretty interesting reflecting back on that time, how that was the buzzword in every VC pitch that we were seeing, that you really did build a public company on that concept.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah. For some stuff, gamification is not all that useful, particularly things that you anyways have to do. So, for example, a smaller part of our business for Duolingo, we have this thing called the Duolingo English test, which is about 10% of our business. It's a standardized English test. Like TOEFL. It's like TOEFL. It's a competitor to TOEFL. It's a test that people have to take to get into a university, for example. That thing, you can gamify it. You can not gamify it. It doesn't matter. The reality is people have to take it and they'll go through it. For something like education, I think gamification ends up really mattering a lot because it's all about motivation actually keeping you there. So I think this was just a very good use of gamification in the end.
  Speaker 2
  Do you have a sense of if you've expanded the market for people learning a language who wouldn't have sought to learn one otherwise?
  Speaker 1
  Massively. It depends on the country. But in the United States, for example, 80% of our users were not learning a language before Duolingo. Your typical American, like... Was not learning a language. Yeah, but they are now with Duolingo. And it's a similar in the UK. It's a similar number in the UK. There are other countries, particularly countries where people are learning English. There, we probably haven't expanded the market as much. But in English speaking countries like the US, UK, Australia, we've expanded the market by a lot.
  Speaker 2
  Did you encounter when you were fundraising a lot of pushback that, hey, this market isn't that big? I imagine it's probably hard to sell the thesis. Our product is so good that we will massively expand the market.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, we did. Our first fundraise was 2011, Union Square Ventures. At the time, Union Square Ventures was very hot. They had just funded Twitter. They had just funded. It was like a big deal. Anyways, we went there and we were so fortunate that they funded us. Brad Burnham was our partner there. He got into our board. We became good friends, et cetera. Many years later, he told me, we didn't think you were going to succeed at that. We just liked you. And we thought you were going to pivot into something else and maybe you'll do something. But we actually didn't think you were going to succeed because we didn't have a product. So that was the first round. That was a series A. By the time we reached the series B and we raced it, kind of the results spoke for themselves. We weren't making any money, but we had a lot of users, especially if we had only launched like maybe two years before that or something. And we really already had millions of users. So it became a lot easier when we had, I don't know how much product market fit was, but at least we had some amount of product market fit.
  Speaker 3
  I'm curious what your thought process and discussions were as you were starting the company, but even before then, and you're looking for a PhD thesis. Were you always planning to be mobile first, mobile native? Because it was right around that generation when it switched from like...
  Speaker 1
  You're exactly right. In 2011, almost no company was doing mobile first. Everybody was like website first because most of the traffic was on the web, like a big laptop or even a desktop. When we started, we thought this was going to be a website. But relatively early on, really, maybe in the first few months, we realized almost everything is going mobile. And we had this insight,...

- Invest in User Retention, Not Early Monetization
  Summary:
  Focusing on user retention rather than early monetization can significantly enhance growth potential.
  During a period without revenue, efforts were directed toward optimizing user retention, resulting in an increase from 13% to approximately 50% day-one retention over five years. This strategic focus created a durable asset—a product capable of maximizing user loyalty, thus establishing a stronger foundation for future monetization.
  Alongside effective retention strategies, the development of a relatable brand mascot—the green owl—emerged organically, creating a unique personality that resonated with users.
  Engaging with the community and leveraging social media, the owl mascot became a vital part of marketing, contributing about 15% of new user acquisition.
  This illustrates that investing in user experience and community engagement delivers long-term value far exceeding short-term revenue strategies.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I am a huge believer that the reason that we have been able to grow so much is because we didn't monetize early on. Now, I cannot recommend that to every single company. I mean, for some companies, you probably should monetize early on. But in our particular case, what happened was this. We launched. Because we weren't making any money, we also couldn't spend money on marketing. Like, we couldn't do performance marketing because performance marketing is this thing where you can pay Google 30 bucks and then they send you a user. But to me, that seemed really dumb to spend 30 bucks to get a user when we were not going to make any money off of that user.
  Speaker 3
  You want to be making more than $30 from that user.
  Speaker 1
  Yes, or whatever it is. You want to just do more than that. And so we couldn't spend money on marketing. We weren't making any money. And we had a bunch of engineers. So what were we going to work on? And the only thing we decided to work on was teaching better and increasing user retention. That's it, because that's the only things we could work on. So we spent from 2012 to 2017 basically optimizing retention rate for users. And we optimized it a lot. I mean, for example, we went day one retention. So that's the retention of people when they show up, what fraction of them come back the second day or the next day. When we first launched, that number was 13%.
  Speaker 2
  As in you lose 87% of your users the day that they...
  Speaker 1
  Well, they may come back another day. 87% happen to not come back the day right after. It could be that they come back later, but that's what we saw. We ran who knows how many A-B tests over this period of time. But by 2017, that number was, I don't know, probably about 50%. I may be misremembering exactly the numbers, but we were able to drive all of our retention numbers by a lot because that's the only thing we could work on. Had we not done that, we probably would have spent all our time optimizing our ad pipeline and optimizing all kinds of weird stuff that ends up making you money, but I don't think helps You grow that much. And I think we were, in retrospect, this was a very smart move. At the time, I don't think we were thinking how smart this was. We just kind of did it. It gave you a durable asset.
  Speaker 2
  I mean, the fact that you now have a product that ensures that you have fully maximized the potential for a user to stick around, it means the user base you've built and the machine by which You eventually do make money is far more durable.
  Speaker 1
  That's right. And I believe that. Now, of course, I believe all of this in retrospect. At the time, none of this, you know, we were just like, I don't know, make a thing that people like.
  Speaker 3
  It was also worth you were raising money at a half a billion dollar valuation.
  Speaker 1
  So this was when money was free in some sense. It's just like, here, have more money. But it worked.
  Speaker 3
  Okay. So you joke that you weren't doing any marketing. And in some sense, that's true. In some sense, it's not. You have the Green Owl, who have had a great brand forever. How did a couple of PhDs from Carnegie Mellon of all places come up with a cuddly green owl and build a... I don't think of CMU as wonderful as an institution as it is, as like the top design and marketing place in the world. They happen to have a really good design program. But look, this evolved over time.
  Speaker 1
  We did know one thing. We did want a mascot. Early on, we were like, look, a mascot, somehow this will help us. We didn't know exactly how, but we did want a mascot. Eventually, we chose an owl because of, in Western cultures, at least as a symbol of knowledge. It ended up being green because my co-founder hates the color green, and I thought it would be funny if it was green. So that's why it was green.
  Speaker 2
  And now your whole office looked behind you.
  Speaker 1
  The first version of the owl was not very cuddly. I mean, it was kind of not great looking, honestly. Over time, it evolved. We hired some amazing illustrators. We hired this guy who still works for us, Greg Hartman, who's our head of art now. He just made an amazingly beautiful owl over time that evolved. And so that's one thing. We just made a really good asset that looks good. And then the other thing that happened is it started getting a personality, but the personality was a little bit accidental. The first way in which it gets the personalities, the owl was actually not in the app at all at first. The only place where people saw it was the app icon, which is kind of a very close-up version of the owl's face. And then also, when you get a notification, it has the app icon, so it looks like it comes from the owl. So the first place where the personality for the owl came up was basically what we said in the notifications. And we started saying some weird stuff in the notifications, and I think people started giving it a little bit of personality because of that. Then another thing happened with the notifications. At some point, we decided, look, we can't be super spammy, so we're going to stop sending notifications after five days of inactivity. So if you don't use the app for five days, we'll stop. Then it occurred to us, well, we're going to stop sending a notification. We may as well tell you.
  Speaker 2
  Right. Get the credit for it.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah. So people know we're good guys. This is what we thought. So that last notification, the fifth day, we wrote it. It just these notifications don't seem to be working. We're going to stop sending them for now. That's what it said. Well, we didn't know this. We didn't expect this. It turns out this got people to come back a lot because they thought that Duolingo was giving up on them. It's like your mother. It's kind of like guilt tripping you. Because of that, though, it started giving rise to all kinds of memes on the internet about how the owl was obsessed with getting you to come back and he would kill you if you didn't come Back. But that was the community. We didn't do that. But after that, we realized that we could push on those memes. And so we started making fun of ourselves with those memes. And that has worked really well. And at some point, we got the idea of getting an owl suit, a suit that somebody could wear. At first, we thought it was good. It was going to be good for recruiting events, like going to try to hire people at universities and the owl suit would show up. Turned out, you could start putting somebody in an owl suit to do weird stuff in TikTok videos. And that gets a lot of people to watch it. And so but that was a little bit accidentally discovered. And in fact, the first person who started doing this was a very young woman, Zaria, who when she proposed it, I thought this is such a dumb idea. I was obviously completely wrong. It turned out this has given us a lot of prominence in the world.
  Speaker 2
  Have you ever tried to quantify? I mean, this is like a core pillar Duolingo's business strategy at this point. Have you ever tried to quantify the business impact of having all this earned media?
  Speaker 1
  Yeah. I mean, we... ([Time 0:22:29](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0bc2281f-d6c2-4bc2-9f2e-90055b8bd032))
    - **Note:** They optimized the product by not having to focus on revenue. They created so many fun ideas like the free owl. They grew because they didn’t monetize but this is just a story not a law. This was massive for them. Free marketing. They did a ton of ab testing which launched their product big time. Hire the best people and ab test to infinity.
- Value User Trust Over Short-Term Gains
  Summary:
  Balancing data-driven experimentation with intuitive decision-making is crucial for sustainable growth.
  Relying solely on A/B testing can lead to detrimental outcomes if common sense and intuition are overlooked. An example is provided where excessive email frequency led to poor user experience, demonstrating that optimization metrics aren't the only consideration.
  A pre-testing product review process, involving leadership input, helps prevent decisions that might maximize revenue in the short term but compromise long-term user trust.
  Importantly, the respect for user experience and maintaining a positive brand association drive future revenue potential, ultimately advocating for a careful approach to product changes, prioritizing user retention over immediate financial incentives.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Well, you planted a seed something that we talked about for like one minute in this podcast, but every person I talked to who's ever interacted with Duolingo, former employees and other Podcasts you've been on is all about experimentation, A-B tests, being data-driven. There has been lots of ink spilled on this for anyone who wants to read excellent blog posts about the AI behind your push notifications and how all those systems work. One high-level question for you. How do you as a leader balance a cultural tenet being data and experimentation driven versus instinct driven?
  Speaker 1
  We're actually weirdly both. I'll tell you where this comes from. We realized early on that pure experimentation can lead you to really bad places. If you kind of just don't think about it at all, you're just going to optimize some metric that can lead you to really bad places. And one of the best stories that I heard about that, and we repeat this a lot at Duolingo, is something that we learned from the founder of Groupon, who happens to be from Pittsburgh. I mean, we're located in Pittsburgh. He happens to be from Pittsburgh. Yes.
  Speaker 2
  We're huge Descript users.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's a great guy. He told us this story, which I'm going to tell it. And at this point, it probably has changed a little bit, because I probably remember now what is in the lore of Duolingo as opposed to exactly what story he told us. But he told us a story about emails that Groupon sent per day. So Groupon, basically you've got a deal. And the idea is at the beginning, they could only send one email per day with one deal. He was strict on it. It's like only send one email per day because more than one email is spammy. At some point, some enterprising product manager shows up and says, what about if we send two? Andrew Mason says, no way. Like, no, we're only going to send one. And then this product manager gave this amazing argument against it. We're not trying to launch two. We just want to know. Are you against knowledge? And of course, nobody's against knowledge. So he said, fine, fine, fine. And so they tested two. Guess what happened when they tested two? Two is way better than one. So they started sending two. And they're like, well, if two is better, test three. Turns out three is better than two and four is better than three, et cetera. And they A-B tested their way to like, I don't know what number, seven, eight or something until the channel stopped working because people marked it as spam and then it died. The channel died. But so this is the thing about A-B testing your way. Like you have to really do the common sense thing above the A-B test. And so what we do at Duolingo is we have this two-step process. I mean, the first one is before you even A-B test something, and by the way, here, we are against knowledge. There are certain things we just don't want to know. And it's because it's too tempting to do it. So the first step is before we do an A-B test, we have this process called product review, which I assume happens in many other companies. But in this case, every single change that goes to the app gets product review. And product review is basically a set of leaders in the company. That includes me. There's about five people. And we look at every change, and we have to agree for it to go out. We stop a lot of things before going out to prevent this type of stuff. Here, we use intuition and just common sense. We're like, no, nobody wants to receive 32,000 notifications. That's just dumb, even if the A-B test says so. I think that has helped us quite a bit.
  Speaker 2
  Do you have an example of a way in which you've been anti-knowledge in the past, something you decided you didn't want to know? Oh, yeah.
  Speaker 1
  I mean, pretty recently, somebody wanted to know what happens if you put an ad that takes over the whole screen when somebody opens the app. Like a product manager wanted to know that. And we were like, yep, but we don't. Particularly with monetization, it's so tempting because what happens with monetization is you run the experiment and then it says something like, if you launch this experiment, It will make you $50 million a year. And you look at it and you're like, that's nice. And then the finance team figures out that this happened. Like somebody from the finance team looks at this experiment and suddenly the CFO is in my conference room or something. And he's like, yo, 50 million bucks a year, you got to launch that. We try not to know the answer to many of these monetization experiments.
  Speaker 2
  When you wear your CEO or your head of product hat, these things are sort of obvious. And what's underneath it is this implicit assumption that there is a future dollar value associated with treating the user with respect and having a feel good association with your Product. It's basically like all of the potential future dollars we could earn are jeopardized by doing this. We're pulling forward revenue.
  Speaker 1
  If you do some- But very hard to quantify, but it's very hard to quantify.
  Speaker 2
  Complicated expected value calculation on it.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah.
  Speaker 2
  Have you ever tried to quantify that brand value or future value? We haven't.
  Speaker 1
  No, we haven't. What we just have is a group of, I'm saying five, but it's on the order of five leaders that have a very good gut feeling about, no, this is too much or no, this is not good. And I think their gut feeling is quite good, I would say. We run into this problem. Sometimes we do run an experiment where we have to make a trade-off. Like, for example, we run some experiment because we know if we do this, we lose 10,000 users but make this much more money or whatever. We've never known how to make these trade-offs. So generally what we do is we go for users, as in if something decreases the number of active users that we have, unless it's going to make us $500 million, we're really not going to launch It. ([Time 0:36:23](https://share.snipd.com/snip/de760bc8-33f8-4439-b475-009aebea97be))
    - **Note:** How vital ab testing is and treating people with respect. Some value can’t be quantified but otherwise test everything. Be very data driven.
