  Speaker 1
  He says, i sat, i sat there in just ideas that we can use in our own lives. I sat there listening. He talked about anybody at the club, from the people doing the changing room to the actual 11 players. I sat there listening to them, day after day, soaking it up like a sponge. The stating became my second home. I was there every spare moment from the age of five. So he opened up the book telling us how important family is. A families everything to hom he talks about this point, the bok met iswa a wife. He gets married rather early, and he says, no wonder we're still together after forty eight years. Our marriage was good twice over. And iin this section, it just seems like every page i'm making a new highlight with the same theme. Fine work that feels like play. So says, i just here's an example of that. I just did what i always ha done, which was ospent all my free time playing football, either at the club, or on the street with my friends. What has been important to me is not only playing football, but enjoying it. On the very next page, another example of work that feels like play. The noted jadami, i wrote down to myself, as i'm reading the section, as if you don't love it, you won't do it all the time. And if you don't do it a lot, you'll never master it. As i always said, if you work in football, it's not work. You have to train hard t but you have to have fun as well. This way, this way of training, has always remained the standard for me. It led me to realize that the easiest way is often the hardest. ([Time 0:12:28](https://share.snipd.com/snip/53cb83a2-8e47-4e1b-8020-ffef73f458ad))
    - **Note:** You can’t fake passion and if you don’t have passion people with it will smoke you. Started working at Ajax at the age of 5. Dad does young and had a great step dad who was a groundskeeper at Ajax. Family was everything to him. He was learning from everyone at Ajax from when he was 5 from the first team to the kit man. You need to train hard in football but you need to love it the easiest way is often the hardest path to success. And likewise. Hard training makes games easy. Believed deeply in the power of practice one touch in the game is the result of 100k touches. His dad died had a great support system you can’t do anything great alone but he would literally go to the cemetery and talk to his dads grave about every major decision he never let it go.

  Speaker 1
  Ind so itch important to point out that johans approach, michael jordan's approach, tiger wood's approach. You do that whether you win or lose, your learning from but in both cases, like if you lost, it's very obvios yan getbe but it's hard for people understand it. Alcaa one, but you can still, there's always room for improvement. Another way, think about this as if you go to sleep on a win, you wake up with a loss. Is an example of that. This paragraph that brought that thought to mind. By the end of my time at ix, i'd won the european cup three times, been named european player of the year in 19 71, 19 72 and, i think in 19 74, but he didn't mention that here. Ah, which was nice. But really, what this is so funny, listen, response, lii wand pas. I won everything you could possibly win. Ah, but, which was nice. But really, what are trophies and medals other than memories of the past? At home, i have nothing on my walls about football. When i was awarded an honor, the medal i was given disappeared into my grandchildren's toy box. Those are the words from a person that's deadly serious about always improving. But listen to that. But, but, which was nice. But really, what are trophies and medals other than mementos of the past? At home, i have nothing on my walls about football. So you go to sleep on a win, you wake up with a loss. And so the johan also goes into the people that probly the most important person in his football career. This disnntot be very similar wher we learn wat jordan with the importance of phil jackson and tex winner. So one of the greatest managers, one of football's greatest managers, is his kind name, renus michols. I've heard it michel's too. I'm not sure how to pronounce it. But the mportant part is the fact that renus and johan share a lot of the same philosophies. They're the ones. They're going to develop total football together. I actually watched a couple of idios on this to try to have a, like, a deeper understanding of it. And what was so fascinating was that he there re ideas that were collected over a generation or two. So renus as older than johan. He was influenced by by people. He had played for people that came before him, he took pieces of their ideas, pushed it forward down the generations, and once he finds johan ther the nes i e able to develop the system. ([Time 0:19:25](https://share.snipd.com/snip/69a876d6-7651-4205-a137-3790611b9511))
    - **Note:** He was critical of everything he did win or lose good or bad always improving. Retired his mom when he turned 18. Go to sleep on a win wake up with a loss never hung trophies they’re a memory of the past and he’s always looking forward but enjoyed every day. At the end he was happy he lived a full life. Trophies were toys to his kids. Never hung him up. Hogan saw winning as consequence of the process they concentrated on. They designed total football from the best of what people had done in the past pieced it together with his manager. They built a system for success. Had their unique philosophy for all parts of football they saw defense as limited the opponents ability to have the ball. He was focused on not just making money but his real goal of playing soccer. Dont confuse the root and proximate goal. Build great products and go from there.

  Total football is, aside from the quality of the players, mostly a question of distance and positioning. That's the basis of all the tactical thinking when you've got the distances and the formation, right? So he's describing the system they're building, right? Everything falls into place. It also needs to be very disciplined. You can't have someone striking out on their own, then it does work. But then he has just tha one sentence that this is where the magic happens. If you think about your adheringto you have the discipline to adhere o the system, and you have the quality players, and you have good managers. Thir's just a well functioning machine. He says, it was world class talent combined with professionalism. Another highlat from this section, i think, is particularly applicable to day. Because we we live in this age of nearly infinite leverage. In to fact, you should be focusing on quality technique. That philosophy was actually very simple and remains so to day. There's a ball, and you've either got it or they've got it. And if you got it, they can't score. If you use the ball, well, the chance of a good outcome is greater than the chance of a bad one. This shifts the focus, this is the whle point of the paragraph. Yme reading this tel this shifts the focus to quality and technique. Whereas before, it was all about effort and hard dinks.

    - **Note:** Total football is one system 1 person made of 11 players sacrificing everything for the betterment of the unit collective intelligence. You need a great system but you need tie discipline to drill the system in. World class talent and professionalism. Switched the focus to talent and technique. He retired and decided to be a businessman outside of his circle of competence and basically went broke. He decided to unretire and commit his life to what he knew best football.

Focus on the right thing he was teaching disabled kids how to play soccer and they sucked he wanted to give it up but then he was shown a video of the kids playing and when you look in their eyes you saw genuine happiness that’s what he was doing not making footballers. In America he learned professionalism.

    - **Note:** Nothing harder or more important than playing simple. Pure beauty. Focus on the small things the big issues are obvious success can be in the details. He knew the people who ran the club had no football experience how could they be successful. Committes are useless cut through red tape bs. Keep the main thing the main thing the team should focus on the first 11 the people in charge didn’t get that. If you’re not serving the customer or supporting those who do you’re useless. Beuracracies lose the main point. Need to master the fundamentals of your craft. First principles over everything. Master the basics before anything else. Be the best informed person in your field. Lived with intensity. Love authentically. A setback is just a sign to make adjustments. Go on the attack.
