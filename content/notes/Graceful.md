### Highlights

- Will inertia be your guide, or will you follow your passions? Will you follow dogma, or will you be original?
  Will you choose a life of ease, or a life of service and adventure? Will you wilt under criticism, or will you follow your convictions?
  Will you bluff it out when you’re wrong, or will you apologize? Will you guard your heart against rejection, or will you act when you fall in love?
  Will you play it safe, or will you be a little bit swashbuckling? When it’s tough, will you give up or will you be relentless?
  Will you be a cynic, or will you be a builder? Will you be clever at the expense of others, or will you be kind?
  These are the choices the linchpin makes every day.
  When you choose to stop being a compliant cog in a blameless machine, it sets you up to be graceful instead. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htwkavgx1cqxpr2kmt7eh07m))

- Fear. It creates anger and selfishness. They sit together, supporting each other, as inseparable as red, orange and yellow on the spectrum.
  Generosity, creativity and gracefulness are at the other end in a similar cluster. If you seek to be creative, start by being generous. Like blue, indigo and violet, they live together. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htwknfsscf30ehjx9ywvn1ew))
    - **Note:** dont be fearful be generous
- Apparently, we don’t have a lot of trouble understanding that work might involve physical labor, heavy lifting or long periods of fatigue. But, for some reason we hesitate to invest a more important sort of labor into work that really matters. Emotional labor is the task of doing important work, even when it isn’t easy.
  Emotional labor is difficult and easy to avoid. But when we avoid it, we don’t do much worth seeking out.
  Showing up unwilling to do emotional labor is a short- term strategy now, because over time, organizations won’t pay extra for someone who merely does the easy stuff.
  We’re not at all surprised when a craftsman sharpens his saw or an athlete trains hard. But when an information worker develops her skills at confronting fear (whether it’s in making connections, speaking, inventing, selling or dealing with difficult situations) we roll our eyes.
  It turns out that digging into the difficult work of emotional labor is exactly what we’re expected ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htwkr5944ksb65hxrf2kr4hd))
    - **Note:** emotional labor
- When you do emotional labor, you benefit. Not just the people you’re working with, not just your boss, but you.
  The act of giving someone a smile, of connecting to a human, of taking initiative, of being creative, of putting on a show—these are things that we do for free all our lives. And then we get to work and we expect to merely do what we’re told and get paid for it.
  This gulf creates tension. If you reserve your emotional labor for when you are off duty (and are happy to give this as a gift to the people in your life), but you work all the time, you are deprived of the joy you get when you do this labor. Spend eight or ten or twelve hours a day at work (not just in the office, but online or on the phone or in your dreams), and there’s not a lot of time left for the very human acts that make you who you are and who you want to be.
  So bring that gift to work. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htwm0t864x4584g2fgma5rx8))

    - **Note:** you can approach every day with blinders or wonder so why not just create wonder and magic like about time. The emotional labor of life is neglected at work, but we need connection so bring it and gain genuine connection. Love yourself and others.
- We’ve been taught to be a replaceable cog in a giant machine.
  We’ve been taught to consume as a shortcut to happiness.
  We’ve been taught not to care about our job or our customers.
  And we’ve been taught to fit in.
  None of these things helps you get what you deserve.
  We’ve bought into a model that taught us to embrace the system, to spend for pleasure and to separate ourselves ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htwm7nhrd13nfnd8spey1mfg))
    - **Note:** We cant select into the world we need to be non-consensus and right
- Our sanitized, corporatized society hasn’t figured out how to get rid of the fear, so instead we channel it into bizarre corners of our life. We check Twitter because of our fear of being left out. We buy expensive handbags for the same reason. We take a mundane follow-the-manual job because of our fear of failing as a mapmaker, and we make bad financial decisions because of our fear of taking responsibility for our money.
  It turns out that we’re even afraid to talk about fear, as if that somehow makes it more real.
  Fear of living without a map is the main reason people are so insistent that we tell them what to do.
  The reasons are pretty obvious: if it’s someone else’s map, it’s not your fault if it doesn’t work out. If you’re reading my script and you don’t make the sale, who’s in trouble now? Not only does the map insulate us from responsibility, but it’s also a social talisman. We can tell our friends and family that we’ve found a good map, a safe map, a map worthy of respect.

- Think about business-to-business sales. The key point of distinction between vendors calling on a company is rarely price. It’s the perceived connection between the prospect and the organization.
  Now, consider job satisfaction. The key point of distinction between places to work is rarely the work you’ll be asking the employee to do. It’s the perceived connection between the employee and the people she works with.
  Thus, the individual in the organization who collects, connects and nurtures relationships is indispensable. This isn’t about recording the information in a database somewhere. This is about holding the relationships as sacred as they deserve to be.
  Only a human being can nurture relationships. It has to be done with flair and transparency, and it can’t be done from a script. The memories and connections and experiences of the person in the center of this culture are difficult to scale and hard to replace. Which makes this person indispensable. Not anyone who has that job— only the people who have that job and act like linchpins. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htwmn0kg8xc1cr0tp2axexpp))
    - **Note:** creating and establishing connections is vital in sales and organizations
- Creativity is personal, original, unexpected and useful. Unique creativity requires domain knowledge, a position of trust as well as the generosity to actually contribute.
  Unique implies that the creativity is focused and insightful.
  Delivering unique creativity is hardest of all, because not only do you have to have insight, but you also need to be passionate enough to risk the rejection that delivering a solution can bring. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htwmwr6wc8es1sxf5vx4jrbx))

- The fact is, a bigger badge isn’t going to help at all. People aren’t going to follow you because you order them to.
  They’re not going to seek out a new path because you tell them that they must.
  Linchpins don’t need authority. It’s not part of the deal.
  Authority lives in the factory, not in your world.
  Real change rarely comes from the front of the line. It happens from the middle or even the back. Real change happens when someone who cares steps up and takes what feels like a risk. People follow because they want to, not because you can order them to. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htwssrdtdp0w8bspa4xjkvqx))

- An artist is someone who uses bravery, insight, creativity and boldness to challenge the status quo. And an artist takes it personally.
  That’s why Bob Dylan is an artist, but an anonymous corporate hack who dreams up Pop 40 hits on the other side of the glass is merely a marketer. That’s why Tony Hsieh, founder of Zappos, is an artist, while a boiler room of telemarketers is simply a scam.
  Tom Peters, corporate gadfly and writer, is an artist, even though his readers are businesspeople. He’s an artist because he takes a stand, he takes the work personally and he doesn’t care if someone disagrees. His art is part of him, and he feels compelled to share it with you because it’s important, not because he expects you to pay him for it.
  Art is a personal gift that changes the recipient. The medium doesn’t matter. The intent does.
  Art is a personal act of courage, something one human does that creates change in another. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htwsz5t78br60y2vx055jnmw))

- Imagine an organization with an employee who can accurately see the truth, understand the situation and understand the outcome of various decisions. And now imagine that this person is also able to make something happen.
  Why on earth would you ever begin to consider the possibility of firing her?
  Every organization, every nonprofit, every political body, every corporation desperately seeks this person. This is our leader, our marketer, our linchpin. She creates forward motion.
  Doesn’t matter if you’re always right. It matters that you’re always moving. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htwt9qc1d77xsc97fd22hkwm))

    - **Note:** Ideal employee. High agency to figure things out and smart. Constant movement forward.
- There are countless people just waiting to tell you how to fit in, waiting to correct you, advise you, show you what you are doing wrong.
  And just about no one pushing you to stand out.
  If you add up all the books, scolds, back benchers, bosses, teachers, parents, cops, co-workers, employees, religious zealots, politicians and friends who can show you how to fit in just so, it’s sort of overwhelming. It’s clear to me that we’re really good at establishing and reinforcing the status quo.
  Fit in too much, though, and nothing much happens.
  Where are the self-appointed agitators and firebrands, the people who will egg you on and push you to stand for something?
  They seem to be missing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htwtd5qfcg76r8cwc9yrrjr9))
