- Never interrupt compounding unnecessarily. Dedication to practice. Handful of simple ideas repeated over decades. In love with the process sets, his own standards believes in living by action. Very financially conservative even when he made it, he felt like he still needed to prove himself. Focused on achievement. Always focused on what’s next everything wasn’t offshoot of his work for success. Set high standards was hard but fair focused on the journey and the score took care of itself. Just wanted to be the best. Have one speed go. Find work that feels like play. He hates working, but he loves playing. He was a very lazy person but just loved basketball so no one had to push him. It’s hard but it’s fair. Some days he didn’t feel like going, but his feelings don’t matter obligated to go. People work hard to play to see him. He’s obligated to put on a show. He’s serving other people he was driven to prove others wrong. Sets iterative targets starts slow when he achieves it he raises it first the best in the park then the best on the team, then a scholarship then nba eventually the best in the world, but only through small iterative steps.

- Jordan coach was good lied so he would get into a basketball camp. He was so good. They asked him to stay for another week but his parents couldn’t afford it. The guy at the camp paid for Jordan just to spend another week because his family couldn’t afford it. Jordan was just ruthless. He came into the bulls and practice harder than anyone held everyone to a standard and embarrassed those who couldn’t meet it. He comes in as a rookie and held everyone to account the bulls didn’t care about the game The team was doing drugs and having fun with girls, but he never did. People didn’t realize all the work behind-the-scenes that made him who he was. They just saw the glamour. The public praises people for what they practice in private, you need to be uncompromising. Pay attention to commitment and passion not results. No compromises. He made decisions with his gut and met buffet who told him he did the same thing which made him feel validated.

- Blinders on focus be a yardstick for quality. Always very present and managing his mind zen Buddhist shit all he has is now and focused on this moment. He worries about Thursday on Thursday lives in the moment. Never worry about others expectations they should never be higher than your own external expects never matter. Focus on the present moment. Set a dream put in the work and watch it emerge. If you know you put all the work in, don’t worry about the outcome because you couldn’t have done more if you put in the work, what are you afraid of limits like fears are an illusion. When you want to win you need to pay the price. Don’t show opponents weakness, even in pain. Customers first and feelings second. As a leader you set the standard and everyone has to live up to it or they leave. ([Time 0:35:51](https://share.snipd.com/snip/21912062-696a-4a41-ab70-8d03b08eae0f))

  Speaker 1
  I remember that day in Utah, they call it the flu game, which we learned it's the food poison in game. I'll never forget that day. I told them, don't play tonight. You were too sick. And what did he do? The best came out because you find that little bit of strength where you keep going when you keep going. That's a termination of focus. The idea that he wasn't going to give up until he had given his last that is life. Give it your best and all other good things will come to you. Then a few pages later, there's just two sentences, two ideas that are conveyed in two sentences that I want to bring to your attention. And this is Tinker Hatfield describing what it's like to work with Jordan. He's just deadly, coolly, efficient. And then Jordan talking about how he approaches everything, which I love. I focus on the little things, little things add up to big things. And for some reason, when I was reading this page in the book, it made me think of, I did this two part. It's like one of the longest episodes of founders. It's the Peter Teal episode. I think it's back in the 30s or something like that. I read Ryan Holiday's book conspiracy, which I thought the storytelling of that book was fantastic. And then Peter's book, zero to one. And there's something I heard Ryan on a podcast one time, he was doing like the book tour, doing these interviews to publicize that release of that book. I think that's probably how I found the book. ([Time 0:46:28](https://share.snipd.com/snip/074cb433-c149-4cdb-9cf2-dd400f0eab7d))
    - **Note:** Little things add up to big things. Ruthless efficiency hyperfocus. He never rode the fence when his friend asked to wear a puma jacket. He cut up all of his friends puma clothes and sent him Nike stuff in his third year in the league. He thought his USA teammates were deceiving themselves about the game required. It’s supposed to be hard, but fair you need to be authentic to yourself. He’s not one for Shortcuts, but work didn’t care about accolades. You have to be the best version of yourself not someone else you can’t have success that way. Once the on button is pushed, that never goes off. You need to take negative and turn them into positives to win you need to lose and fail. Failure fuels his success so when you have to lose, and so you can’t have regrets. Has a positive mindset, can’t be afraid to make mistakes. Don’t let the mind play tricks on you to keep you from reaching your goal.
- Turning Negatives into Positives and Overcoming the Mind's Tricks
  Summary:
  Embrace failures to succeed; view negatives as opportunities.
  The mind can deceive, creating obstacles to reaching goals. Recognize these tricks and push past them with a strong work ethic.

  Speaker 1
  He never said a word about his hands. That's how you get ready. Once the on button is pushed, there isn't an off button. So another idea. I love the fact that Michael is always talking about something he learned from his parents, something he applied for the rest of his life is that you got to take negatives and turn them Into positives. So he's got this really famous commercial Nike commercial. It's the Nike commercial about failure. And I'm just going to read you real quick because I pulled a transcript. I've missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games, 26 times. I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed. So he's asked, I'm going to combine this with it. Something else I heard him talking to interview. He's like, what's your biggest regret? I don't have regrets to win. You have to lose to be successful. You have to have something that wasn't successful to be happy. You have to have disappointment. And to me, that's the idea he's expressing. I just have one sentence for you here. He's talking about the commercial that I just read to you. The idea of not being afraid to make mistakes or using negative outcomes to create positive ones was great. And so let's go back to this mindset. The reason I'm talking about, hey, like you get close to Jordan, you hear his words, you read books about him, he watches interviews, you're really downloading his operating system And the mindset that he approached his craft. And he talks about the mind over and over again. And he says, the mind will play tricks on you. The mind was telling you that you couldn't go any further. The mind was telling you how much it hurt. The mind was telling you these, you telling you these things to keep you from reaching your goal. How weird and twisted, right? And crazy this is, right? You have a goal, your own mind is trying to play tricks so you don't get you don't accomplish that goal. The mind was telling you these things to keep you from reaching your goal. But you have to see past that turn it all off if you're going to get what you want to be. I'm going to read this again. The mind will play tricks on you. The mind was telling you that you couldn't go any further. The mind was telling you how much it hurt. This is Michael Jordan. This is not a soft weak person. And he's telling you the mind play, my mind tried to do the same thing to me. Right? This is extremely important. The mind was telling you how much it hurt. The mind was telling you these things to keep you from reaching your goal. But you have to see past that turn it all off if you're going to get where you want to be. So there's a couple quotes I'm going to, before I go to the next page from my notes on all these talks I've been watching. So one of this I think that will help. And Michael says, work ethic eliminates fear. And actually, you know what, before I go back to my notes, what he's talking about the mind playing tricks on you that you're going to be here for work ethic eliminates that Jeff Bezos In the next page. Jeff Bezos, what Michael's about to tell us for reminding me what Jeff Bezos said. He says, Jeff says, Jeff's stress, stress primarily comes from not taking action over something that you can have some control over. So Michael is saying, I was as prepared as I could possibly have been for that moment. I couldn't go back and practice a little harder. I knew I had done the right things to prepare myself for that situation. One way or another, I knew I was prepared to be successful. Now, if you know you haven't prepared correctly, which is what Jeff is just saying, which is the root cause of stress, are you haven't worked that and then you haven't worked hard enough, That's when other thoughts and emotions creep into your mind. That is stress. That is fear. Pause here. Go back to this. Work ethic eliminates fear, right? Back to Jordan's paragraph. It is the same process for doing anything anywhere in life, no matter how big or small, whether it's running a corporation, taking a test in the second grade or taking a shot to win the Game. At that moment, and I double underline this this sentence, this is fantastic. At that moment, you were the sum total of all the work you have put in nothing more and nothing less. If you are confident that you have done everything possible to prepare yourself, then there is nothing to fear. Back to my notes on the talks. I have total confidence in my skill, so I am not afraid. It's the same idea. He's expressing I think like 15 year gap between those two ideas. So it's obviously very fundamental if he's still talking about it. More notes. I know I can play this game and I know I can play it at the highest level. You've got a lot of guys with the ability, but they don't have control of their mind. I'm not making this up. How many times is Jordan saying the same idea over and over again, the importance of having control over your mind? A lot of people can run and jump and shoot, but they don't have the killer instinct and the confidence in themselves to perform those skills. Let's go back to this Zen, you know, he's having influence by what he learned from Phil Jackson from the psychologist and meditation that living in the moment, like the Zen Buddhism Idea. I want to allow whatever is going to happen to happen at its own rhythm. That is just there's a single quote on an entire page. ([Time 0:56:38](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7eed634c-cfc4-4d98-a1ae-9c6b8778f6e9))
    - **Note:** The mind place tricks on you to keep you from reaching your goal. Don’t let it turn it off push through. Stress comes from not preparing enough for the moment when you prepare enough, you cannot stress or fear. Work ethic, eliminates fear. You need to have control over your mind. Work to eliminate fear. Effort is all that matters.
- Mental Preparation and Confidence
  Summary:
  Confidence is derived from thorough preparation.
  Having control over the mind is fundamental to success. The importance of confidence and killer instinct is reiterated by Jordan multiple times.
  Influence from Zen Buddhism emphasizes living in the moment and allowing things to unfold naturally.
  Success comes from putting in the work rather than chasing after it.

I want to allow whatever is going to happen to happen at its own rhythm. That is just there's a single quote on an entire page. I want to allow whatever is going to happen to happen at its own rhythm. Something he told Oprah that's kind of similar to that thought. If you chase something, you might not get it. If you put forth the work, the next thing you know, it's bestowed upon you. Okay. So now he's got a bunch of ideas on this page. ([Time 1:00:35](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3efe4dc5-8a1a-482a-9441-3b8a6b96e3bb))
    - **Note:** Allow whatever to happen just put in the work don’t chase anything. Be on offense all the time attack every day. Find motivation every day trick yourself to push yourself every day. Excellence is the capacity to take pain. He wants to show how tough he is. He plays so hurt. It’s a test of your will to succeed. Everything comes with a price. Control your mind turned his dads death into a positive of having him for 32 years but still thinks about him every day. It doesn’t have to be someone else it can be you you can be the answer. Believe in practice. Listening is a super power admit when you’re wrong. Team player commitment to team. Successful people listen those who don’t listen don’t survive. Focus on the moment all is now. He’s fully connected to the present moment he doesn’t make assumptions about what’s next he just embraces the now.
