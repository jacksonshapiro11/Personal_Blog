### Highlights

- Humans are meant to grow and transcend themselves. Reasonableness is readiness to listen to criticism.
    - **Tags:** #critical-approach-(conjectures-and-refutations), #embrace-criticism, #transcend, #favorite
- We are liable to be lead or tricked by people who tell us they know the way. We become tricked by beliefs strongly held about national ideas that aren’t fully right. Blinded by fervor from the truth. We live in the best world so far because mens rights and dignity are respected more than ever. Power still corrupts though. The war of ideas fighting with words and ideas instead of wars. All wars are wars of ideas. Truth is manifest means the truth is achievable and we don’t achieve it from our own ignorance. This just says the truth is obvious and those who dnt see it like we do are idiots. we should instead adopt critical empiricism instead of manifesting truth from facts. You need to tolerate others beliefs and force it on others. Truth is hard to come by. Listening and criticizing is critical to the truth. Respect tradition and push change forward.

    - **Note:** We sometimes get swayed by people who have high conviction but conviction and accuracy don’t correlate. People think truth is obvious but often truth is hard to reason and figure out and isn’t conventionally accepted because of this we need to remain open minded to all ideas and change our minds/hold beliefs lightly. We need to welcome discourse and disagreement and focus on being right over the long term. Maintain the critical and liberal approach constantly.
      All wars are wars of ideas.
- Rationalists uses reason and argument instead of propaganda and violence. We must not convince but be open to new ideas and changing our minds. Reasonable and holding views lightly instead of a zealot. Give and take openness to changing your mind. Many wars were fought but religions who wanted be to go to heavan good intentions but were unwilling to change their mind. Reasonable and tolerant. Give and take in ideas. Things can be rational only in comparison to an end then we come up with the means to conquer our specific goal in the rational framework. Ends are the goal in mind and this can create different actions and lead to issues of the ends require means that counteract each other like violence and non violence. The issue with utopia is ends change and then the path becomes a circle so you need an authoritarian to execute on the vision but that causes violence. Violence and utopia counteract. Instead of creating utopia by building good fight against misery. Invert. The state should eliminate evil and every day people should be free to strive for their own happiness. All generations deserve to be happy we shouldnt trade off happiness in one generation for happiness in future ones. Liberal values the right to live the life you’d like to achieve happiness without fucking with anyone else’s shit. Men should use reason and knowledge not to dominate but to take violence through learning from others and good conversation.

    - **Note:** We must use reason not violence to convince people of our beliefs and be open to changing our minds given our beliefs may be wrong. There has been more violence caused in the name of what is good and right than anything else. Rationality is only in comparison to an end or goal and often these end goals and subjective like the idea of utopia. Instead of striving for utopia and idealizing an end state we cannot agree on we should eliminate the evil in the world and allow people the platform to achieve what they believe is happiness. Trying to create utopia just leads to the centralization of one way of life instead Dj j of freedom.
      Use reason not violence. Utopia is tough to reason so just eliminate bad. Liberal ideas and debated drive things forwards quicker. This is like all unhappy families are different. Give people space to realize happiness not the opposite of trying to pursue state happiness. Most violence done in the name of good intentions. Eliminate evil invert. Everyone deserves a happy life.
- Liberal values of free and open discussion that leave the door open to criticism and improvement. The liberal way is the best way so far. Public opinion in organized institutions and loose ties like individual beliefs is important to keep impartial and not bastardize/arbitrate truth. We must hold free and open discussions in the face of public opinion.

    - **Note:** We must preserve the liberal mindset allow all ideas to be entertained and taken seriously that come from well meaning well reasoned places. Encourage disagreements and debate. We don’t know the truth but we can seek to be opening in figuring it out. Free/open discussion that help discover the truth no justified true belief.
      We must have our institutions be referees of discussions not arbiters of the truth
- Science works because we understand the entire system. Social sciences try to use the same framework but the system is too dynamic to predict so it’s not good science. Conspiracy theory of society. What people don’t like like war or poverty is the direct design of certain groups. Most conspiracies and social science produces the opposite unintended effect. Like studying why when someone wants to buy a home the price goes up when they want it to go down. Marxism seeks to destroy institutions and build new ones which can cause error. Revolutions cause suffering and only if you know the other side is better can you enact the revolution which rarely ends up being true. We don’t need revolutions just better institutions. Replaces masters we need good systems that create the right incentives. We need a government that can change without bloodshed. Marx doesn’t believe in institution but classes. We transitioned god to nature to history ect same idea just a different word.

    - **Note:** Systems are set up to serve a certain function and built emergently people think that it is stacked against them but this is often just unintended consequences from the system. Revolutions cause more suffering than just inverting and trying to reduce suffering within the system instead of blowing the system up to create more suffering. Conspiracy theory of society and social sciences are trying to figure out why we produce unintended consequences with our actions like an opposite reaction. Unintended consequences are features of systems. Predictive history is the sane thing in religion and Marxism.
      Intended consequences are inevitable and features of systems make systems less bad not overhaul. Conspiracy theories of society.
- Dialectic thesis anthesis and then synthesis. Then creates new dialectic triad. Gives us a starting point to point out inconsistencies and levy criticism. We must reject the contradiction between the thesis and antithesis nd in this we grow to find something that incorporates both with no contradictions.
    - **Tags:** #iteration, #synthesis-vs-process, #understand-both-side-of-the-argument, #sum-greatr-than-parts, #critical-approach-(conjectures-and-refutations), #embrace-criticism
    - **Note:** Dialectic is investing truth or inquiry. We must take the best parts from our current understanding and the best rejections to it and come up with an output that contains the strongest forms of both and avoids the weaknesses
      This is iterating on an idea to improve it. Understand both sides of the argument and piece together further growth.
- Karnap changes his mind even if the belief is well held if there is good evidence to change his mind. Key to science is demarcation can it be tested and critically discussed or not. Specific predictions with clearly testable and more easily refutable more specific predictions. Non testable things are unscientific or pseudoscience. Metaphysics isn’t always a bad thing something can appear meaninglessness and be wrong yet it advances a question adequately. This revolt against metaphysics led to the rejection of the soul and the rise of behaviorism which didn’t advance the narrative just created easier stimulus response events to seem more scientific while it may not have actually been so. The idea of a force and hidden forces are present in physics and shouldn’t be called metaphysical in psychology. Carnap differentiates between object and meta languages and proposes one language ti encompass all of philosophy. Information theory and probability- more content is lower probability but things with high probability give no new information or content. Science isn’t about being right it’s afoot advancing into parts unknown.

    - **Note:** Science is about demarcation can it be clearly tested and refuted or not.
      Crazy ideas and metaphysics aren't always bad things and can advance the narrative and widen people's minds. Science is supposed to make low probability predictions into parts unknown. The revolt against metaphysics produced behaviorism which was arguably worse and more dogmatic and produced less knowledge exploration
      There is a language of objects and a wider meta language that exists
      Science isn’t about being right it’s about advancing into parts unknown pushing the frontier constantly
- New theories should Proceed from a unifying idea between connections or relations of unrelated things. Like planets and apples. Structure of the world. This is hard because any structure has baggage of what you need to accept as priors before you accept this new theory. It should be independently testable with new predictions. Better testable than the previous theory. Theory must pass new and severe tests. We need general explanatory theories.

    - **Note:** New theories unite disparate things under the same concept like gravity that hints at a structural truth. Needs to have more verisimilitude and pass more tests but we need to be careful of the bias inherent in existing models.
- The history of science is the history of irresponsible dreams of obstinacy and of error. There is no law of progress. When we criticize our ideas we create progress in them in other fields we have change but don’t experience progress. Because we don’t have the good natured criticism. With increasing content the probability of it being true decreases but we should seek very explanatory low probability insights. If we aim to acquire more knowledge we must aim for less probable hypotheses. High probability usually reveals nothing information theory. We should seek low probability guesses. Science moves from problems to problems not theories to theories we keep taking on harder problems. Science is about finding deeper problems to solve. Objective truth is truth correspondent with the facts. Truth isn’t subjective because others believe it. Truth can be something everyone actually rejects. This allows us to say we search for truth but may not know when we have found it. It’s a guidepost. We can find inconsistencies that show something is false but we can’t know if it’s 100% true. Science isn’t about finding the best theory but continually progressing through mistakes to better explanations. Science is about finding improbable truths that reveal a lot of new knowledge that is unlikely or low probability. As much interesting and relevant truth. Bold conjectures. Verisimilitude is choosing the most true option 2 theories might both be false but one passes more tests than the other so there is relatively more truth and it is a better approximation even if it’s false. Better agreement with the facts newton and Kepler are both wrong but newton passes tests Kepler doesn’t. Probability vs truth likeness. Verisimilitude combines truth and content while probability combines truth and lack of content.

    - **Note:** This is literally amazing read it all.
      There is no law of progress some fields with the critical approach can create progress but others just have change. We must be critical to have progress.
      Information theory idea about unpredictable leads to more info gain and so low probability ideas lead to a large information gain.
      We’re never fully right we’re fallible but we get more right.
      Truth isn’t something people agree on and we should aim to find interesting truth. Progress from mistake to mistake with both conjectures. Truth is objective and we may not even know when we've found it
- Kant made the realization that what bacon had said was wrong we do not need to first begin with observations then derive theories but the opposite we should begin with explanations. Newtons theory was seen as perfect and correct but it was proved false this set the tone for the idea that all theories are guesses and we are fallible. Better explanations have more reach. Question nature like Kant we don’t try to prove we try to disprove. Experience is creative.

    - **Note:** We should derive good explanations that we test for theories. All theories are fallible and better theories have more reach and predict more. We should seek to disprove not prove theories
- Freedom can not be subdued because he is free and has agency to make choices in his life. Socratic idea of self sufficiency. Kant said all men were born with the burden of free decision.
    - **Tags:** #agency, #free-will, #self-starter, #active-participant-in-your-life, #favorite, #burden-of-free-will
    - **Note:** All people have free will and agency in their life. Burden of free decision
- Heraclitus sees the world not as stagnant but in flux. Things are constantly changing and change relies on identity. We cannot always see things changing in the moment like kids growing older but the world is one system based on change in constant flux. Change is a leaf that turns brown not a green leaf swapped for brown. 2 schools one seeks to preserve knowledge the other encourages conjecture and criticism. Says here are my ideas and the leaders seek to improve at all levels. This leads to growth. Our knowledge is not final but conjectural and consisting of guesses. Hypothesis rather than truths and critical discussion is the only way to get closer to the truth. Bold conjectures and free criticism based on science. Innovation is encouraged and boldness admired. Critical rational idea has been discovered only once. Rational tradition is the only way to expand knowledge. Theories can be better because they explain more or are better tested. We don’t know we can only guess. We’re happy to open up to criticism and likewise criticize you back. All knowledge is guesses but we can have better guesses. Through seeking we find what is of the better xenophones old Greek dude. No man knows the truth nor will he know it because all truth is a woven wen of guesses. Search for truth through critical discussion. Inductivism science starts by observation then proceeds by induction to generalization to theories. Science starts not from theories but from problems.

    - **Note:** Science starts from problems and the critical approach is used to better reason and propose answers to those problems. All knowledge is conjectural and this critical tradition is what drives our thinking and society forward which has been discovered only once. Theories are better because they explain more or are better tested. Change is constant and we shouldn’t persevere the past but seek to constantly disprove it. The nature of change being tied to identity. The thing that changes needs to have oneness or else something else changed. Truth is woven in guesswork.
- Good science is not about disciplines and thinking small but about thinking big about the world our place in it. Holistic over specialized. Science is not based on its origin but on its explanatory power. How is change possible without losing its identity because then it hasn’t changed. Hereclitus all things are process and change the world is not stagnant trees with fire around it but all all consuming dance in oneness. Changing thing remains itself in identity but it’s form changes a leaf turning from green to brown vs swapping a green leaf for a brown leaf. The world is constantly in flux even if we can’t perceive it in the moment. Like watching your kids grow up. Change and opposites are just 2 sides of the same coin good and bad. Life isn’t things it’s processes constantly in flux. Departures from common sense or historical tradition should only be rejected when supporting evidence is strong. 2 types of schools one that teachers the words of the master and one that contrasts ideas and styles from many different leaders that seeks not to replicate but to evolve and learn.

    - **Note:** Good science isn’t about being in a discipline but being across disciplines transcending paradigms and existing above the world.
      The world is a living breathing actor of change not intermittent actions of a river constantly flowing and moving no man steps in the same river twice and such is life. This means we can’t simply accept the words of the past we must question and improve on them through conjecture and criticism.
      Life is a process not a thing. Change and identity
- Tradition is engrained but how to we differentiate between traditions we blindly accept and those that have been sufficiently criticized. Conspiracy theory of society is just another type of belief in a certain god controlling outcomes but instead of Zeus it’s the rich and powerful There is always a reaction to social theory that changes the way the theory is interpreted much like how someone wanting to buy or sell something effects the price in an undesired direction. The issue of the social sciences comes when we discover the unintended and unwanted consequences of our theories and actions. For see the direct and indirect consequences of social situations. We should figure out why someone acts a certain way in a certain situation that no one wants like why wars start even if no one wants them. Marx said the capitalist is as trapped as the worker what systems force behaviors that are negative as a whole. Science is as much myth making as the tales of old but now there is a second order of critical discussion and analysis of these myths. The critical or argumentative second order consequences of myth making. Scientific myths are different because the process of criticism helps them more accurately resemble reality but they are at their core no different than the myths of old in their nature and construction of what they are trying to achieve. The liberal mindset. We must build through good explanations conjecture and criticism not observation. We take what we have learned and stand on the shoulder of giants take their best guesses and stress test them. You can learn by accumulating knowledge or by conjecture and criticism of what you know We need to understand our environment so we can predict behavior otherwise we’re lost and confused. This helps define our social life we need traditions and customs to underlie how we interact socially otherwise we are lost and confused. Social norms that govern the undercurrent of all our interactions. Tradition creates order and regularities which is vital in a social world. You always need to make small adjustments take what you have then tweak if you destroy everything you’re left much worse off. Tradition is good because it makes things fit in a box and people don’t like change and tradition gives people comfort. We must uphold reason and intellectual responsibility. Correct and revolutionize but the goal of new theories is to remedy what the old theories could not not to run away from their problems We need a tradition of conjecture and criticism that is what defines our scientific myths.

    - **Note:** Tradition combined with critical approach leads to knowledge acquisition over time. What traditions are real proved by science and which are ones we blindly accept. Conspiracy theory of society is we think inevitable negative extraneities of systems are by design not a feature of all systems. How do we create systems that have the absolute wrong behavior that no one actually wants. Science is as rooted in myths as anything but the critical approach leads to a more likely truth content. Stand on the shoulder of giants and be critical. Social norms are present in all interactions. Tradition creates comfort which is good but intelectually not as great like the pain body
- 1. The scientists aims at finding true theories of the world. Validated by experiment and good explanations. 2/3 there can be no certainty on theories nor essential truth just conjectures truth. It’s not that essentialism is false it’s that we should not believe something to be essential we should continually criticize it. An experiment can either be disproven or corroborated to a degree of how specific and improbable it is. Essentialism is wrong because there are no essential truth. Instrumentalism is wrong because they provide tests to corroborate explanations but aren’t the source of the explanations. Popper proposes conjecture and criticism as the best way to acquire knowledge. Essentialism fails because there is no deepest truth just different levels of abstraction and criticism.
    - **Tags:** #essentialism, #validated-learning, #critical-approach-(conjectures-and-refutations), #fallability-(of-knowledge), #instramentalism, #truth-seeking-(vs-being-right), #truth-is-manifest
    - **Note:** We aim to find truth and validate it. We are fallible and there are theories but not truth. We need to remain critical. There is no essential truth and instramentalism is wrong because tests aren't truth only explanation. We can only find truth through conjecture and criticism
- Successful conjectures are possible because we are not passive receptors of sense data but active organisms who respond to our environment sometimes consciously and freely not just instinctively we can invent myths and stories and we have a desire to learn and know. We invent stories and theories and try them out. We can make up stories of invisible things like atoms that explain the more visible world. Knowledge is the adventure of ideas. We create our theories and impose them on the world but we cannot know why we are successful because we can never be 100% right about our theories we just haven’t yet found the right explanation.

    - **Note:** We are active interpreters of the world and we create myths and stories that explain our experiences out of thin air. Atoms are an invisible idea that we manifested and we impose our explanations on the word. Similar to sapiens in humans being the stories we tell ourselves. There is objective truth and us not know the answer is always caveated with yet.
      Active interpreters of the world. Synthesis not just process. We use memes to create knowledge
- We are students of problems not of fields. Multidisciplinary learning. While similar problems unite to form a field this is more a group of like problems that relies on the work in other fields as well to solve. Geology requires math and physics. Philosophy can be used and should be used to solve problems. It is not inherently meaningless. Wittgenstein says that all philosophy are just quirks of language and false. Here he is able to reject a lot of bad wordsmithing that pretends to be logic but goes do far. Rejects bad language for bad philosophy and there is a lot of elequence that hides bad philosophy and bad philosophy hiding in bad logic. Don’t focus on methods or dogmas of a school but pursue interesting problems. Just because a problem is in the classical domain of physics doesn’t mean there isn’t a philosophy behind it. The idea of philosophy is to solve problems and the different disciplines are upshot’s of those original problems and methods to solve them we shouldn’t reject these as not philosophy or become a zealot for their methods as methods are problem specific and evolve and all good problems are philosophically relevant.

    - **Note:** We shouldn't be students of fields but follow interesting problems and use cross disciplinary thinking to span fields. There is a lot of great language that hides bad philosophy. We should aim to follow our interest and resist the dogma that comes with it. Develop philosophies to solve problems not working in fields.
      The problems come first then you use tools in different fields to actually get it done. Great point being made. Study problems fields are emergent from problems and change over time
- Simpler theories are good because they’re easier to prove wrong. Don’t use ad hoc theory but a specific one. Meaning is not a basis for good science just because a theory seems to have meaning doesn’t make it true and good theories don’t essentially tie meaning into them. Trying to infer meaning from observation is inductivism. Science is taking known quantities and combining them into something unknown at a higher level of emergence. You can induce idea but you need to deduce proofs. You deduce fell stronger premises to weaker conclusions. Induction starts at the conclusion and then tries to find premises which is lower probability and likely wrong.

    - **Note:** Theories don't need to have deep structural meaning but should be the combination of lower levels of emergence to produce something insightful at a higher level. They should be specific and predictive not backwards or inductive. Theories should be simple and falsifiable.
- We must start with a theory not observations. Observation is selective if you say observe that doesn’t mean anything you need an object of observation just telling a room of people to observe means nothing. Dogmatism the strength of a belief is in its repetition and regularity not in its conjecture and criticism. Dogma is the resistance for change and to continue to see the world through a specific lense without questioning or criticizing. Dogma seeks to verify while criticism thinks to disprove. Induction is no valid we must seek to criticize and falsify not confirm beliefs. We must accept that our beliefs are the best we have to go on but at the same time understanding that they’re likely some degree of false. Accept that with new evidence we’re likely to disprove even are closest held theories and be open to that fact in our search for knowledge. Science should aim at low probability explanations that are so specific and expose their self to falsifying that they have predictive power general theories that can’t be proved wrong don’t tell us much about the world. High probability bets provide lower pay offs than lower ones that are more specific but provide greater leverage and knowledge gain in the world. Unwilling to follow the drift of contemporary philosophy and opting to try to solve problems with rational arguments. First principles over trends.

    - **Note:** We need to aim to craft good explanations with reach not see and extrapolate from events. We should never confirm our beliefs but actively and aggressively seek to disprove them. We shouldn’t say or study things that are obvious but things that are so out there that their truth unlocks a ton of reach. Accept the best explanation and seek to disprove it not affirm it. Seek explanatory knowledge instead of connecting ideas and extrapolating. Observation needs a clear object or goal of that observation and dogmatism thrives because of its anti rational nature.
      good explanations ruthlessly criticized and low probability avoid dogma assume you're wrong
- Astrology vs astronomy - theory’s that prove true in every instance are false because they are so general as to make no prediction. Good theories are specific and hard to vary. Better theories take more risk with the specificity of their prediction and a general theory that proves everything is unscientific not very good. Theories should be falsifiable based on the predictions they make and instead of trying to confirm a theory we should try to falsify it to improve it. Freudian psychology proves all behavior Einsteinian physics can only function in a specific world. Good theories are very easily and clearly testable and refutable if they’re false and we should seek to prove them wrong. Another bad science move is to slightly alter a theory once it’s proven wholly wrong to fit the history that occurred. This makes it pseudoscience. Predicting this is the year given the roster and schedule doing a game by game analysis is scientific but when each game goes the other way blaming it on wind and bad luck while maintaining the overarching thesis is bad science. Make specific predictions before the event. There are elements to pseudoscience that are correct but we should reject them not their conclusions forever though. Astrology was a bad science but the fact that the tides and planet alignment effect the earth is actually valid. Bad science but conclusion right. Myths can underly future science. Demarcation - finding a criterion for the scientific. Verifiable and testable. Nothing can be proved or disproved based on observation.

    - **Note:** Good theories are very specific low probability and testable. You cannot pivot easily from a good theory you need to overhaul it. Good theories can only exist in a specific world while bad theories exist in every world. Freud had an explanation for every behavior that was easily variable.
      Great explanation of theory’s. Testable theories. Good theory’s clearly define what they are not.
- 1. There are no ultimate sources of knowledge just suggestions we need to test 2. The proper question is about asking about truth not about who told us justified belief. Test assertion 3. All arguments are relevant 4. Best source is tradition as these have been tested for a longer time but these should still be tested and criticized 5. Knowledge doesn’t start blank but builds on previous knowledge usually we’re kinda right 6. Pessimistic and optimistic in the blind sense are both wrong 7. Errors help us learn. Observation and reason aren’t authority. These help to find truth 8. Every solution of a problem raises new harder problems we become less ignorant but our world expands. Our knowledge is finite ignorance infinite. Truth is beyond human authority.

    - **Note:** Knowledge is fallible and can always be improved/tested but we stand on the shoulders of giants. bring the critical approach to learning through testability not justified true belief. We learn through errors and all knowledge is wrong we must grow. We must remain open minded to all sources
- Here popper is rejecting the idea that knowledge needs sources and the desire to have sources of knowledge is in fact a mistake of knowledge. This rejects the empiricist notions of justified true belief for something deeper and more involved. Sources of knowledge it’s ok to have sources for our knowledge but our knowledge isn’t predicated on sources we should not take something as truth just because of who said it. Likewise we can use sources for our knowledge but we must gauge and vet them. We do not need an ultimate source of knowledge this can come from experiment not word of mouth but we need not use experiment to prove everything. Politics we should not ask for sources of our knowledge but how we can effectively eliminate error from our knowledge. Good systems promote good ideas by getting rid of the bad ones quickly. We don’t worry about sources but correct errors in knowledge by asking about validity and truth of knowledge. Our knowledge is guesswork. We reveal knowledge by criticizing our own ideas and the ideas of others to make them more right. —> critical rationalism. If we have choice it’s our own opinion to obey a command based on how valid we see it not who said it. In science how do you know is I don’t know it’s a guess based on best available knowledge and I’m happy to make it more correct by criticism.

    - **Note:** Justified true belief is false there is no arbiter of knowledge the because I said so camp yet we still need to trust and get sources of knowledge.
      We can have an experiment based proof of knowledge system or likewise we can create a system that effectively eliminates errors. Both have their function.
      All our knowledge is fallible and grows through conjecture and criticism. We can never be 100% right but we can always improve. We must know we have absolute power over our minds.
      Benefit of a good system is that it's anti fragile. A good political system wants all ideas and should do its best to remove the ones that don't work swiftly. Knowledge creation is difficult and we need to focus on building the right systems to filter and extract true knowledge.
      No sources just conjecture proof and error elimination. Rejecting empiricist noting that we need to test everything. Good systems test and eliminate error.
- Optimistic epistemology there is no reason for a man to appeal to authority because each man had the ability to discern truth for himself. Man can know and can be free. This promotes the liberal worldview of empowering man Pessimism man cannot know and needs guidance and rule to tell him what to do. Story of authoritarian. This story of epistemology and anything you do is cloaked in your own biases so you must be aware you have them and work to mitigate them. In searching for truth we should criticize our most closely held beliefs. There is an idea that truth is manifest that truth is obvious in the world and we are blinded by our ignorance to that truth. Truth and goodness will prevail in an open encounter otherwise it is being suppressed but this is false because truth is very hard to find and conspiracies propagate for many centuries. This bad idea lead to liberalism which believed truth can be achieved but it also leads negatively to authoritarianism and cults which claim to have the manifest truth. Spelling out the book of nature leading to knowledge or the prejudice of the mind that prejudged and misjudged nature leading not to truth discovery but mere guesswork. The state of knowledge is a state of truth and these sources must be kept pure. They waged a war against authority but they replaced one authority with another. Popper proposes the idea of fallibility that our knowledge is inherently both right and wrong and we must search for the errors to constantly improve our perceptions of the world. Error is the natural state of knowledge and we are trying to become less wrong. Through rational and self criticism. Wisdom is in our understanding of our great ignorance. Given we are all fallible abs partial or error we must be tolerant of others. Justified true belief he fallabalism.

    - **Note:** This pushes against the idea of passive optimism and assets we must be actively optimistic justified true belief is false and everything we have is fallible. It only improves through conjecture and criticism. Truth isn’t obvious and can be hidden or suppressed for centuries. Error is natural state of knowledge ignorant of our ignorancd.
- We learn through conjecture and criticism of correcting our mistakes and we are never right or wrong we are just applying the best explanations we have for that date and time.

    - **Note:** We learn through error and the critical approach. Use the best explanations and respect the fallability of knowledge
