- Summary: An assessment of a company’s strategy is arguably the most important part of the investment process for a long-term investor. In a nutshell, strategy explains how a company achieves sustainable value creation. A company creates value when it makes investments in people and assets that generate cash flows over time that exceed their cost, including the opportunity cost of capital. Sustainable means a company can find and invest in attractive opportunities for a long time.

### Highlights

- Exhibit 2 shows the breakdown between these parts for the S&P 500, an index of approximately 500 U.S. stocks with the largest market capitalizations, from 1961 to mid-2024. On average, the steady-state value has been two-thirds of the price and the anticipated value creation the other one-third.13 There have been bouts when the price reflected little or no future value creation (1974 and 2011) as well as significant future value creation (1999 and 2001).

    - **Note:** ROIC over a decade always regresses to the mean for the top 4 quartiles with the bottom quartile lagging likely due to those companies going out of business dragging down returns with every company staying alive achieving similar market returns so ROIC over the long term regresses towards the mean with returns being competed away. roughly 1/3rd of returns is due to priced in growth with 2/3rds of current price being actual current value
- The spread between ROIC and WACC is a good proxy for value creation, and the stock market tends to reflect this metric.21 ROIC is defined as net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT) divided by invested capital. You can think of it as how much the company makes (NOPAT) compared to how much it has spent on its business (invested capital).
  Having a positive ROIC is not enough because capital has an opportunity cost, the value of the next best alternative for spending that capital. Imagine the opportunity to acquire two streams of identical cash flows with one priced to yield 5 percent and the other 7 percent. Allocating capital to the series that earns 5 percent fails to earn the opportunity cost of capital because there is an alternative available that earns 7 percent.
  Analysis of a company’s strategic position and prospects is not an academic exercise. The goal is to determine whether a company’s strategy will allow it to produce sustainable value creation, which is what the spread between ROIC and WACC measures.22 Later, we will see how specific strategies can lead to different paths to ROIC. But for now, we want to emphasize that there is an absolute threshold for value creation.
  It comes as no surprise that there is a lot of variance in the ROIC-to-WACC spreads for businesses. This is true because companies are of all ages, have managements with differing skills, compete in a range of industries, and pursue distinct strategies.
  The top section of exhibit 5 shows the spread between ROIC and WACC for 63 industries in the U.S. in 2023.
  (Appendix A includes ROICs by industry, calculated traditionally and adjusted for internally-generated intangible assets, for U.S. companies from 1963-2023.) Some industries have positive spreads, others are roughly neutral, and the rest have negative spreads. The bottom of the exhibit features three industries, one with a positive spread, one that is neutral, and one with a negative spread, and zooms in on the ROIC-to-WACC spreads of the companies in those industries.
  The striking feature of this exhibit is the similarity between the pieces and the whole. Industries that create value in the aggregate nonetheless have companies that have neutral and negative spreads. And industries that destroy value in the aggregate still have companies that create value. This analysis tells us that industry alone does not seal a company’s fate for value creation.

    - **Note:** ROIC - WACC is basically what you produce vs your costs to produce that ie your financing costs. Some industries have a positive dynamic some a negative one but within the industry there are many examples of companies across this spectrum like facebook vs myspace both tech companies likely with similar WACCs and different ROICs maybe there are other examples of the latter like microsoft vs upstar cloud company who could achieve similar ROICs but the risk of funding the smaller one leads to a higher WACC and less productivity because of the name brand
- Industry Map. Constructing an industry map is a good place to start the analysis of an industry.36 Exhibit 9 is an example for the U.S. airline industry. The goal is to include all of the companies or entities that may have an impact on the profitability of the firm you are analyzing. Suppliers, which provide the firm with its inputs, are typically on the left side of the map. Customers, the purchasers of goods or services, are on the right. We also consider factors such as government regulations, tariffs, and labor markets.
  We recommend listing firms in each section in terms of market share so that relative size is immediately evident.
  Further, it is useful to include potential new entrants to the degree that they can be identified or contemplated.
  It is also important to understand the nature of the economic interactions between the organizations on the map. For example, relationships may be non-contractual (travelers buying airline tickets), contractual (software-as-a- service), a cost-plus contract (government acquiring defense systems), a best-efforts contract (an investment bank underwriting a security for an issuer), a license (a movie based on a doll), an option (an airline purchasing aircraft), or some other arrangement. Identifying potential agency costs is also useful. These costs arise when an agent, a party acting on behalf of another firm that is the principal, takes actions that harm the principal.
  Finally, the map will ideally include any other factors that might affect the profitability of the focal firm. For airlines, these might include overall economic conditions, geopolitical risks, climate change, and global pandemics.
  Research shows investors may profit from understanding the connections that industry maps identify.37 Specifically, when shocks to one firm in the system affect other companies, because of either supply or demand links, the market often fails to reflect the information on a timely basis. This produces an opportunity to trade profitably. Further, sell-side equity analysts who follow suppliers and customers produce earnings forecasts that are more accurate on average than analysts who follow only suppliers.38 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jb7kexg1spahbq4v2ae2f7mf))

- Industry Structure Five Forces Analysis. Michael Porter developed the five-forces framework to provide a rigorous way to analyze the structure of an industry. There are a number of points to consider before starting this analysis:50 • The goal is not to determine whether an industry is attractive but rather to understand the drivers of profitability. Specifically, you can assess each force in the context of what it means for prices and costs. This analysis includes consideration of the income statement and the balance sheet.
  • Strategy is not about a company beating its competitors. It is about figuring out how to earn a sustainable economic profit. Interactions with competitors are important, but so are relationships with customers, suppliers, and complementors.
  • As with profit pool analysis, you want to separate what is structural from what is temporary or cyclical.
  Porter argues that underlying change is quite limited after an industry goes through its emerging stage.
  • The structure by no means seals the fate of the companies in the industry, as we saw already. Sustainable value creation is the result of defending against and shaping competitive forces to establish an advantage. • Much of what is put forth as analysis of industry structure is simply listing pluses and minuses for each of the forces. The objective is to go beyond the superficial to get a complete view of the drivers of profit.
  Exhibit 17 shows the five forces: threat of new entrants, rivalry among existing firms, bargaining power of suppliers, bargaining power of buyers, and the threat of substitutes. While all of the forces are important, we believe that threat of new entrants and rivalry among existing firms deserve more extensive consideration than the others. In particular, we will examine barriers to entry, what impedes additional firms from seeking to compete, in some detail. But first we start with a brief look at the bargaining power of suppliers, the bargaining power of buyers, and the threat of substitutes.51 Exhibit 17: Five Forces That Shape Industry Structure Threat of New Entrants Risk: New competitors erode market share and profitability.
  Mitigant: Establish strong barriers to entry.
  Rivalry Among Existing Firms Risk: Intense competition reduces profitability.
  Mitigant: Avoid direct competition and promote legal cooperation.
  Bargaining Power of Suppliers Risk: Strong suppliers increase input costs and squeeze margins.
  Mitigant: Diversify supplier base and consider vertical integration. Bargaining Power of Buyers Risk: Strong buyers are demanding and limit profitability.
  Mitigant: Differentiate and promote customer loyalty.
  Threat of Substitutes Risk: Substitutes offer products that limit industry profitability.
  Mitigant: Innovate, improve products, and create switching costs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbsbkw97ja3r26syxgn144k7))
