  Speaker 1
  That's a very, very good point. I was very jealous of my friends who were getting hired by Accenture and Anderson consulting and PWC, et cetera, et cetera. They didn't make me offers. And I was jealous now as it ended up, as we'd sit around talking about our jobs or whatever, I got far far more experience from where it doesn't look good on a resume or anything like that. Their jobs looked far better on the resume. And they made slightly more than I did. But you can find ways to compound even in non ideal situations. And I learned a lot more. Again, how do you turn a negative into a positive? I would go into American general finance, which ended up being owned by AIG or Prudential or Barnet Banks, which was the biggest bank in Florida. I got acquired by Bank of America, Raymond James, et cetera, et cetera. Here I am. You're the regular, you're the boss, actually. So I would be able to sit down with the CFO of these huge, huge companies as a 21, 22 year old, literally no nothing kid and literally just fire away with questions for hours and hours and Hours on end until this CFO is like, where's this going? I'm just learning. But you've got full privy and my friends at the big eight were able to do that. ([Time 0:27:55](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d6e3524c-2004-4c39-8a39-a4f4da9f7fad))
    - **Note:** Turning positive into a negative and compounding our advantage always learning. Saw range as the better long term optimization even if shorter term it won’t get you as far. Go slow to go fast later. You cannot connect the dots looking forward.

  Speaker 1
  He asked me all about Marsh McLennan. If I take this job, what am I getting myself into? So I walk him through what I know. So that's not even the punchline though. We get to the end, Steve is on the board of Fannie Mae. So he says, okay, this is great. We talked about Marsh for two hours believing he says, by the way, are you short anything else? I was so naive, I didn't know that Steve was on the board of Fannie Mae. And I said, oh, Fannie Mae's 10 times worse than Marsh, he turns like he almost fell over. He's two hundred of the boy. He turns three sheets of white. He grabs the table because he thinks I'm messing with him. He's like, what? And I said, oh, Fannie Mae's a complete accounting fraud. I was like, there's going to be people that go to jail prison over this. He's like, you know, I'm on the board. And I was like, no, I didn't know that. I said, I would get the hell off that board like tomorrow. So he's like, can we have breakfast tomorrow? I said, yeah, we'll do it again. Sure. So we talked for like, for an hour, as I walk him through all of this derivatives accounting and all this arcane Byzantine stuff, he has to excuse himself. He's a lawyer. He's excuse himself from the meeting. And he left the board that night at five. So then he comes back, call me the next day and said, we want you to start a fund and we've been looking for somebody for seven or eight years. And so it's funny how things work out.
  Speaker 2
  That's an amazing story. And we are gradually entering closer to those faithful conversations first with Charlie and then Warren that led you to your migration all the way to the Great Plains of Nebraska from New York. But let's come back one more time to that compound interest equation. Because I think we've hit on some really important tips for finding your P, which obviously traditionally stands for principle. But I think what we're saying is that it can really be considered your passion or your purpose, whatever that thing is that you're trying to compound. And that process of discovering your P for all of us is just such an important part of our personal journeys. And you've given us some great ideas there. I think the main message I'm taking away is just let your curiosity go. Let it run free and just try to keep up. And then we have the R, the rate of return or the velocity vector, the growth rate. How do you actually get better at something? How do you over the course of time, speed up your growth? And I've heard you in the past advocate for active learning versus passive learning today. We've talked a lot about developing your aperture for a strong work ethic. And now this idea of cultivating range, I think that's just such a killer insight. Okay, so now let's turn to that third critical variable. And I think, again, we could be completely off on this, but I think Paul and I tend to feel this is both the most important and also the hardest one to harness. And that is the T exponent, the time horizon or the duration of compounding. Now the world is full of people, particularly in investing, I think, that just seem to find their thing or something at least do well for five, six, seven years. But then for whatever reason, things just drop off. And on the other hand, we talk about Berkshire as being the eternal compounder.
  Speaker 3
  It's like a company that just continues to grow, thrive.
  Speaker 2
  It's like a redwood that just defies the traditional laws of nature. I'd love it, Todd, if you just have any reflections, whether it applies to Berkshire or even just in your own life, how do you keep it going? How do you extend the T in order to get to those out years where I think it was back in the 60s when Warren first wrote about this, where the joys of compounding are really unleashed?
  Speaker 1
  Well, it comes back to purpose. There's a reason Tom Brady kept wanting to play because you're good at it, but you're good at it because you love it.
  Speaker 2
  And I'm not comparing myself to a with that. I just thought about how that might sound, but you could take anyone who's really, really good.
  Speaker 1
  Federer didn't want to retire. Joe Kavik doesn't want to retire. They want to keep doing it because they love it.
  Speaker 2
  Like Novak, he's just one is 24th Grand Slam. He's breaking every record there is. And I recall I think it was actually just before he won the US Open where he was asked about how he continues to keep it going. And his answer basically came down to the fact that he really just loves hitting a tennis ball. Like he just doesn't want to stop the fundamental act of hitting a fuzzy yellow ball because it brings him too much joy. And actually, I think there's a lot of professional tennis players out there who just don't love that fundamental act of hitting the tennis ball like he does.
  Speaker 1
  When you see it with any sport, you hear the stories about Larry Bird or Steph Curry being in the gym, the first one in the last one out, etc, etc. You can only drive yourself or push yourself so much if you don't love it because it needs a super, super, super competitive world. There's a million people that want to be Joe Gavit, Chautombrady, or Steph Curry, or Warren Buffett or whatever. So yeah, grit and pushing yourself can go a long way. But in a world where a million people are trying to do this, if 0.1% of them just absolutely love it so passionately that they're going to bet about it, thinking about it, they're waking Up, thinking about it, etc, etc, etc. You're not going to be able to compete with that if you don't love it to your core. And so that comes back to your question about why it's so important to fight. If you're back-solving for the narrative of I want to be rich or famous or have adulation or these things, it's totally short term. It's ephemeral. It's transitory. You may be able to fool yourself for some period of time. It's more linear. You're never going to get the long scale to compete with the people who really, really, truly love it. So that's why it's so important to find your passion. And I think in that vein, I'd say it's super, super important to take a lot of risk when you're young. I think that's really, really important. I did because I had nothing to lose, to be clear. I think that the hardest thing to do, actually, is to force yourself to take that risk when you either come from privilege or if you have a foundation that's much higher, you have downside. So that's why it's important to take risk when you're young because as you get older, you have more downside risk. So you've got nothing to lose at your age. You take the risk and you can massively screw up and nobody's going to hold it really against you unless it's fraud or something like that. I mean, you take intelligent risk. Don't take stupid risk. Comes back to the specialist versus generalist thing. Society, no one tells anyone that. They all want you to take the safe path. And it's, again, ([Time 0:52:16](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b9b5ff5e-289e-4ffe-b7f2-d4a30ee1feea))
    - **Note:** For your p cultivate your natural curiosity that’s what you want to compound your increase the rate active vs passive learning as well as grit and range and you just do it forever. You can’t compete with people who are doing things they love because you won’t work as hard so find something you love when you compound. You can’t fool someone over the long term. Take risk when you’re young even when you have downside. Pull forward your mistakes when you’re young and work outside in not inside out. Take risks find what you love.
