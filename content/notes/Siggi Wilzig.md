### Highlights

- Spent time in Auschwitz was working 12 hour days as a 13 year old in Germany. 59 members of his family died and he came to America with no money couldn’t speak English.
  He was with a girl who had lost her family they asked him what he did he said he was a master tool maker he went to the camp she went to the gas chambers. He lived with survivors guilt his whole life. He never got the feeling of the camp out of his head.
  He knew he was smarter than the guards and the only way he could survive was through psychological warfare. He always knew he’d survive. Took all his family and possessions and shaved his head but he still felt superior the mind is a powerful place and what you feed it can effect you in a powerful way. They had guns but he felt he had more power.

    - **Note:** Siggi lived wiry the deep pain from this event in his life but this also provides a proof of concept to him about the power of the mind and how what you feed it is vital.
      Deep self belief and psychological warfare. Power of the mind. He had the inner power and used his mind to one up the guards. Self belief and agency even in a situation without any.
- Siggi worked in the hospital in the winter which he got in due to his intelligence and not wanting to work outside in the cold. He was made to load sick prisoners onto cars and saw there clothes return the next day. He fed sick prisoners including his dad potatoes the next day 80% had died he may have poisoned and killed his dad Jesus. Then he found out his mom had died.

    - **Note:** Siggi used his intelligence to survive he worked in the hospital and may have given his dad food that killed him.
- He had to make life and death decisions under uncertainty. When he gets a job as a carpenter it could be a real job or a trap. A man tells him I can’t tell you what to do you’re a smart young fellow follow your instincts. Survived 2 years in the camp. His friend saves his life and they go on the death March 6k people go 1.6k survive. He has bunk mates dying every day he made them look asleep so they would still get his rations.
  He hunted nazis for 2 years after being liberated from the camps. This gets him a ticket to America with $200 and no English. He takes his first opportunity which is shoveling snow for $2 a day. He then works in a sweatshop then in sales continuing to grow. Workaholic then he starts investing in the market.

    - **Note:** Ziggi was constantly confronted with life and death decisions in the camp and had to make these under great uncertainty. He had friends and a networks and used his resourcefulness to survive. He hunted nazis after the war then came to the us poor and worked his way up the ladder. If you run his life 100 times he’s always successful because of his principles and drive it doesn’t matter what it would be place and time didn’t matter.
      This is extreme agency and self reliance where every decision is life and death. Extreme life and death agency. Great principals. No one is coming to save you you must think for yourself. Then gets to the us and wills himself to success. Good principles create a good life.
- He had many jobs took many risks and when things failed he dusted himself and got back up again. He was a master salesmen. He meets a senior Jewish man who had been accumulating stock in the same company and they hatch a plan to take it over. Siggi says he can run it despite having no experience belief in his agency. He convinced family and friends to also buy stock. The ceo died and he became ceo and wanted to grab life by the horns. They need to grow the company and so he bought a bank this gave him unlimited funding to grow his company. He was the only oil company to do this. He did things that didn’t scale and was very customer focused. When a customer came in crying because she didn’t understand how interest worked and couldn’t buy Christmas presents Siggi “looked at the numbers” and said the bank made a mistake. They weren’t the only bank in town. When you delight customers they’re very loyal to you. When asked how he gave such good rates and why the bank present personally approved loans he said because his competition didn’t and we a result his customers would evangelize him. Spoil your customers they tell their friends the best marketing is word of mouth.

    - **Note:** Siggi didn’t know the word failure and believed supremely in his skills and agency to get on the horse once he fell off.
      He took over a public company and became ceo despite never doing anything like that.
      He was relentlessly customer focused and did things that didn’t scale while doing things his competition wouldn’t do or didn’t think of. As a result his customers loved him and would evangelize him which is the best marketing.
      Supreme belief in agency getting up after failure unique problem solving and cultivating customer relationships
- Workhorse - someone who showed up did the job and left never had good ideas.
  Racehorse - someone with potential an individual with initiative ambition and go beyond the call of duty.
  Don’t turn a work horse into a racehorse.
  He would wake up screaming. Complicated relationship with god.
  Had a giant ego. He hated authority. Only the people with egos pursue a crazy level of greatness despite people telling them no. Always desperate for cash.
  Never give up only death is permanent everything else can be fixed.

    - **Note:** He never accepted his fate only death was permanent. He had a massive ego and deference to authority. He lived with the holocaust his whole life.
      Workhorse vs racehorse concept. Optimize for peoples strengths. Very high agency.
