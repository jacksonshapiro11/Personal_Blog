### Highlights

- What Makes a Good Candidate?
  Key takeaways:
  - After applying initial screens, only around 50 stocks are typically left in the universe to choose from
  - Metrics and characteristics of securities are important factors when selecting a security
  - Knowing the constraints and challenges of deploying capital is important for success in investing

  And one of the things that really shocked me the last time we got together is we were talking about the characteristics that call the universe down from call it 3000 securities or 7000 securities or whatever you want to call your big wide world. And you said, well, actually, once we sort of apply our initial screens, it's more like, I think it was like 50 stocks that you can ever really look at, which I thought was really fascinating. So maybe you can talk a little bit about those initial screen and the constraints that you face and try to deploy capital. And then from there, once you get that universe called down to a pond you can fish in, what are some of the sort of metrics and characteristics you are looking for at any given time and trying to pick a security? You know, what makes a good candidate? So I think in terms of like the listeners right now, this is probably going to be one of the most interesting aspects because this is getting into the skin of the game and part of what we do.
  Speaker 1
  So if we just use an example of the US domestic markets, we start with the screening process of about 7,000 unique securities. Once we overlay our growth models, it gets narrowed down very significantly, like you mentioned. So let's define some of those metrics. First is that a general rule of thumb, the definition going back to growth is that you want to have about 20% increase in earnings, 20% increase in sales, and a little bit lower than 20% for your margins like you return an equity. And then you want to see an acceleration in these numbers most significantly and needs to be weighted in the most two recent quarters. We could get into why that is and then perhaps maybe that's more of a momentum fact versus like a fundamental fact or et cetera. But that's something that we generally look for. And then we look for margin expansion. So just with those factors alone, if you narrow down the database, start from 7,000, any given time period, you probably end up with less than about 100 stocks. But then it gets reduced significantly when we add in liquidity factors. So everyone has different liquidity parameters and risk tolerances that they were able to deal with. I will maybe give an example of what's available in the marketplace and then how I'm able to kind of navigate with it. Because the liquidity aspect, the more I get involved with being a portfolio manager, the more I realize it's one of the most significant factors. Because you could have a really great idea that you're able to find. It's just, it's very illiquid. It's tough because then you're getting a premium for being the liquidity risk that you're not necessarily wanting your portfolio, especially your capital allocators. And if it takes you a long time to put on an exit position that creates a lot of other different metrics. So the clearly aspect, generally, I use a parameter of having a company that trades $100 million a day. So the average daily dollar volume needs to be about $100 million. Now you could deviate from that if it's kind of like the preferred habitat theory and maybe fixed income. You're going to stay in your preferred habitat, but if you get a premium outside of that, then you will deviate. So I like to think of that of like the $100 million benchmark of what I like to navigate in. So out of the 7,000 unique stocks in the domestic database, about 500 companies trade more than $100 million a day. It's not a lot. If you narrow it down further, about 175 companies trade more than $250 million a day. And then 75 companies generally trade a half a billion and only 25 companies, it's actually 24, trade over $1 billion a day. It creates another subject. I won't deviate too far, but in terms of looking at proxies of markets and all these different things, it's, would you rather look at the Dow or would you rather look at 25 or 30 stocks that trade $1 billion? That would probably give you a good indication of what the market is doing. So back on track, I use $100 million on a daily average dollar volume and the rule of thumb, it's really simple for risk parameters. If you want to be 5% or maybe say a little bit more aggressive, 10% of the average daily dollar volume, that's only $10 million building a position. It's very small and significant amount. And then knowing it might take you 15, 20, 25 days to establish that position, that's kind of where you get these numbers from. It's from a risk framework. Now outside of that, what's a really interesting one that I know has a lot of edge in it. That's one that I use a lot is the institutional sponsorship that we talked about. And it's something that doesn't get a lot of talk for whatever reason, but it's something that's very prevalent. So institutional sponsorship, what I mean is one, how many mutual funds and how many long short funds are in your stock and then two, the quality of them. So we rate these funds on a ton of different metrics, but basically we know what are good funds, meaning higher returns, what are bad funds, meaning don't produce any returns that don't outperform the market. So generally we know whether the good funds are buying our stock, the higher rated funds. And then to further analyze that, we know typically these set group of long only mutual funds, if they tend to establish a position and they have a multi-year time horizon and they follow similar growth models in us and we see through public filings that if they establish a position that generally that liquidity is on our side, and more often than not, these funds are going to continue to buy. One way to reaffirm this is that if the next quarter are updated, they've added to their position. So now all of a sudden we have our fund with money in the stock, a couple of other funds with it, and then now we might have a handful of the really big large mutual funds on the stock. That helps with the conviction building process because some of these growth names can be volatile and if you know your stock is down maybe 10 or 15 percent. And a couple of week timeframe that, hey, Fidelity Contrefund has $110 billion in a single growth equity strategy, they're going to step in and allocate to the position because they're just not frankly buying at highs.

    - **Note:** 20% growth in sales with margin expansion.
