  So the first and best way to stay poor is to start tomorrow. So whatever it is that you want to do, whether it's losing weight, saving money, starting that business, whatever it is, to start tomorrow. All right. So that's the best thing you can do to stay poor is to start tomorrow. Okay. The next one is to read lots of books and then do nothing. All right. Because it's one of the, you know, lots of people talk about reading books and I see people all the time that I've seen for years in the exact same position posting every. Oh, yeah, I'm reading 52 books this year. That's my commitment. Instead of reading 52 books, maybe just read one book and actually do something about it. Crazy. I know. Number three, take advice from poor people on how to be rich. All right. So think about that for a second. A lot of us surround ourselves, or at least I did when I was starting out, surround ourselves with people who are very poor and we listen to their advice on how to be rich and they have no idea what they are doing. And we also listen to their judgment on why our idea is stupid, even though they are poor. So what would they know? Right? So number three, take advice from poor people on how to be rich. Number four, this is a big one. Pick a spouse who will make you feel guilty for working. All right. So you have your dreams. You have these things you want to pursue, but this person is saying you shouldn't do that. You need to be doing X, Y, and Z blah, blah, blah, blah. And then you feel like you need to compromise your dreams for that person. The problem is that you put your power of your destiny in their hands and you're asking for permission instead of support, right? Because the end of the day, if you don't accomplish your dreams and you did it because of them, who do you think you're going to resent? Right? So you owe to yourself and you owe to your marriage to a pick people who are going to support you in your dreams, even if they don't necessarily agree, right? But more easily, not put your power on somebody else. Number five, fail once, quit forever. All right? So as soon as you do actually start to decide doing something, you fail immediately and say, oh, I guess this isn't for me. I guess success isn't for me. I guess business isn't for me. I guess sales isn't for me. I guess whatever the thing is, isn't for me because you failed once. But it's because we have an incorrect view of failure, right? Because failure is a necessary part and the thing is that you learn from failure. And so it's either you win or you learn, right? But that is the fifth thing you want to do if you want to stay poor forever. Number six is think that the world is fair. So a lot of us, especially me earlier on, like, I would complain. I'd be like, that's not fair. This is fair. It shouldn't be this way. Blah, blah, blah, blah. And the thing is, is that all that complaining that I did did nothing at all whatsoever. Did nothing. And so the thing is, is there's no activity that comes from blaming your circumstances, which just so happens to be the seventh one of how does they pour is blame your circumstances and complain, all right? Complaining about things that you cannot control. And the thing is, is like these sound so obvious, but think about these in reverse again. So if the contrary of thinking the world is fair, is assume the world is unfair and then act accordingly. Instead of blaming your circumstances, you think your circumstances for who you are and what they gave you, right? ([TimeÂ 0:01:53](https://share.snipd.com/snip/65488fca-23ff-466a-8c56-95c069603c0e))
