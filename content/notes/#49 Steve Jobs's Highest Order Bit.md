### Highlights

- Episode AI notes
  1. The most important takeaway from this episode is the importance of believing in oneself and having self-belief. Steve Jobs's natural talent and belief in himself allowed him to overcome doubt and pursue his passions with confidence. It is crucial to have self-belief and confidence in one's abilities. Additionally, having a passion and love for what you do is essential. Self-belief is the highest order bit that comes before developing a passion. Acting like you can accomplish something increases the likelihood of success. Furthermore, pretending to have complete self-belief can inspire others to believe in you as well.

  Speaker 1
  Is the most significant bit. The highest order bit implies that you always want to be working on the most important thing. By definition, it is the most important thing. And so for Steve Jobs, having a passion and a love for what you do is the most important thing. But I think he actually skipped over something because of the fact that he had a talent and a skill that was natural and pronounced early in life that a lot of people lack. And that is self-belief. And so I actually think the high order bit may actually be that you believe that you can do something. That is what you start with first. And then you develop a passion and love for something. Or maybe a more precise way to say this is that you have a belief that you'll figure it out along the way. Steve had that. And I think it came naturally to him. And because it was so natural to him, he skipped over that party. Just assume that you had it. And then you go right into a passion and a love for what you're doing. There's a great line by Steve's mentor and his boss when he was 19, which is Nolan Bushnell, who's the founder of Atari and Chuck E. Cheese. And he says, there's something indefinable in an entrepreneur. And I saw that in Steve. I taught him that if you act like you can do something, then it will work. I told him, pretend to be completely in control and people will assume that you are. And I think that advice works for self-belief too. One way to do this is to ask yourself out of everyone that you know, or everyone that you know of, who has the highest level of self-belief. And then just act like they do. Pretend to have complete self-belief if you don't already have it. And then other people will eventually share that belief with you.

    - **Note:** Having the highest order bit in life your North Star being something that you truly and deeply love of you donâ€™t love it youâ€™ll give up and if you donâ€™t have the deep self belief you can do something crazy you wonâ€™t even try. Love what you do to persevere when youâ€™re tough. The high order bit could be a a belief in your own agency and ability that you can actually do anything then you figure out that thing alone the way. Act like you can do something and people will believe you can. Have complete self belief than others will agree with you. Look at people with immense self belief and copy them.
      Highest order bit = north star must have love must have intense self belief. There is no deeper power than believing in yourself
