  Speaker 1
  I think people are withholding so many opinions and stories about one another. And so we're not getting the feedback we need to be able to be more present in the moment in which we can make those decisions. Can we just tell each other our stories that we make up in our heads about each other? Because it's about you. And it's good to know what stories people make up about us, because my experienceis there's almost always a gem in every story that somebody has about me. And from presents, i always ask the question, not, is it true what you're what you're saying about me, but how is it true? How is it true a that i'm no not as effective as i could be? Or how is it true that i'm not listening enough? Or how is it true? So i'm asking teams to tell each other their stories more often so that they can see how is it true, and then learn from that to be able to grow and be more effective in their decision makingitis Theyre sort of like tips and tricks that we can learn as a group, because often groups are the body making decisions, whether it's preferably a person, but the group has to work together. And in order to get the best information, you need to be able to be honest about about things. Are there? How do you form that any group? How do you encourage it? I like this practice. Ii use what seems a lot called on story. I'll say, let's say, shane, you and i are on a team, and i say, a shane, the facts are that, ah, you led a podcast between the two of us a earlier to day. And then i would say, here's a story i make up about that. And i, hopefully i'm holding the story with curiosity, a as tough i, you know, i'll say, i i make up a story that, and then i tell the story. But i can, as a team member, if i can put a fact in story, it kind of helps the person relax a little bit togo. It's just a story, and it gives him a little freedom to speak more candidly to one another. And so i've done this before where i just come into a team and i say, we're just going to go around the circle. You've to pick a different person each time, and, yo, know, fact and story. And we'd maybe do three rounds of that. And each time you pick somebody new on the team. Reliably, i get feedback. But that may have been one of the best practices they've done in a long time, that they learned things that had not been learned. Elephants came out. People got valuable feedback, and they realize, like, we don't give any time and attention to being able to reveal these stories in a way that lets us all evolve. And so they all said like the decisions they were making, they had a big decision to make about what they were to sell the company or not. And that's one of the reasons why i was in there. There was a lot of debate going on. And so i just said, let's do fact and story around. And it wasn't even a silly round, whether we sell or not. It was just around each other. And some of it was around that topic. But at the end, they had such clarity about whether knowing whether to sell or not once they did that. And i think they felt more comfortable with a decision because they hadha each other. A story i make up, is, you're more concerned with money than you are with the well being of the company. Like that was one of the stories that came out. Ah, because the one somebody who wanted to sell, you know, they were saying, i think your and so to be able to recognize oh, that's a perception you all are having. Will let me clarify why i do think this isn't the best interest, and it's not just because i want more money. So we wouldn't have known, we wouldn'thave be able to even have that conversation if those voices hadn't come out. So fact, in story is one of my favorite tips to teach court teach teams. I love that. And it comes back to something we talked about right at the startand it seems to actually to be cropping up throughout the entire conversation, which is making the invisible visibleye. Because the story i'm telling myself is completely invisible to you. And the way out of thi story, to a better outcome is to start making what's invisible visible, so i can course correct, so you can understand me more. I do think that's what i'm that's since i was a kid, i would be nervous, cause i would say, like, doesn't everybody see thi stuff? But we're al, they al look like the parents all tring to make this invisible, and it's not invisible to me. And so i think that's been my whole life, actually. Andm just getting that aha. Hearing you talk like my whole life been, i relax more when we make the visible or the invisible visible, it feels like a friendlier world. Ah, it feels like we can do something with that we can't, we can't grow with the invisible. So that is, i think my whole, much of my work is about that iner, my inner work as well as my outer work.

    - **Note:** Facts and stories make the invisible visible what’s actually happening but then what’s the story everyone’s telling themselves about that event. We want to sell the company is a fact then the stories are this os best for the company or this os for money only. Stories we tell ourselves are powerful align mental models. Make the invisible visible.
