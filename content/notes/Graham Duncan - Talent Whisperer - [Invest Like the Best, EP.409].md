### Highlights

- **Moneymaker Mentality**
  * A 'moneymaker' is someone with the ability and intent to create more value than they capture.
  * They prioritize making money over being right and understand the long-term, iterative nature of transactions. Make money in the long term. 
  * They possess a knack for finding where value naturally flows, similar to turning on a faucet, rather than forcing outcomes.
  * This pragmatic approach, prioritizing working _with_ the market, can be a key differentiator in successful investing.
  * The optimal blend of strategic planning ('Harvard nerds') and adaptability ('Chicago improv') contributes to a moneymaker's effectiveness.

  It's such an important term in our dialogue over the years. Why is that word so incredibly useful?
  Graham Duncan
  So the term originates, Adam used it at Goldman. Other people at Goldman, I'd heard it from. And it connotes all the cliches, moneymaker. I think what's in there is one way I've ended up defining it is it's the ability and the intent to create more value than you capture. So that would be a kind of abundant version of it. I feel like there are people who are signaling that they're in a repeat iteration game and they're not going to grab every penny on this transaction because they know that there's a sense Of proportion about it somehow. Goldman has that phrase, long-term greedy. It's like, I want to make money, but I'm going to do it with the knowledge that we're going to see each other again. And that sense of I'd rather make money than be right is another core tenant of it, where there are people who seem to me to be in the game in order to experience the satisfaction of being Right. And that's the primary goal. And that works some high percentage of the time, but then it can be disastrous, of course, because your ego and your portfolio can get caught up with that goal instead of just making money.
  Patrick O'Shaughnessy
  Was there any through line to the mistakes that you made at East Rock? Backing deals, managers, seeds?
  Graham Duncan
  There's a great story that Tina Fey has about the only thing she learned from Lorne Michaels. Not the only thing. One important thing she learned at Saturday Night Live that she brought to 30 Rock was that you need in the writing room, you need the optimal mix of Harvard nerds and Chicago improv. And I thought that was so profound when applied to investment managers, because I had experienced a lot of both types. And I would say the Chicago improv is pure plasticity, pure flexibility. They will do anything for a laugh to a fault. And the Harvard nerds in her language were planning everything out, very high order, very high stability, but not able to improv as much. Over time, my taste evolved to accommodate more Chicago improv. I was at first attracted to Harvard nerds. Over time, I came to appreciate, Charlie Munger calls it the knack or called it the knack. I remember early on in working with Ted Seides, we were in a meeting with a former Milken credit trader of some sort. And we were sitting in a restaurant in Santa Monica, and he turned it to me at one point, he put his hand on my arm and said, money's like water. All you have to do is learn to turn on the faucet, see? And I thought I was in some sort of David Mamet movie or something, but he's right. There is this Wu way, not forcing it, working with, there's a coach I like who I follow online named Joe Hudson. And he had this line of, where does the water want to flow downhill? Working with, not forcing it, like working with what already wants to happen that I feel like is in there, lack of stuckness. It's like a pragmatism that at the end of the day rules out over other facets of investing. ([Time 0:22:14](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8c0724ef-16a9-4117-a6d1-85e3d6fc9b3e))
- **Investing Landscape Evolution**
  * The investment landscape is constantly evolving, with new opportunities emerging due to disruptions like AI.
  * Adaptability and opportunism are crucial for investors to thrive in this changing environment.
  * Traits like decisiveness and open-mindedness remain important, especially during periods of significant change.
  * The ability to embrace change and flow with it, rather than resisting it, is becoming increasingly valuable. Transcend and create your own style. 
  * AI's potential impact on markets is both exciting and concerning, raising questions about the future of investing.

  I'm curious whether there's more or less capacity for investing masters today than there used to be. And I guess it's kind of a question on like market efficiency and what you think about markets and whether or not it's going to attract great talent in the way it has in the past. As a profession, do you feel like it's as potentially rewarding and exciting for a 22-year as it was 30 years ago?
  Graham Duncan
  I think if you define it at the right level, it is, which is back to the point that maybe founders versus or startup founders versus hedge fund managers and private equity managers is A tricky distinction. Much disruption that'll cause in investing, but how many new opportunities. And maybe it'll be a startup founder who's organized as a company that ends up making the most money. I was talking with somebody who's deep in the AI world recently, and they're paranoid that there may already be AI at scale in markets. And I thought it was such an interesting idea, even if they're wrong. Like, oh, it's the kind of thing that's going to happen sooner than you think, and then weird stuff's going to happen. I think existential questions about AI and how it'll reshape the world aside, I think it'll morph and commercial, pragmatic, aggressive, humble people will continue to thrive in The system, but it may take lots of different forms.
  Patrick O'Shaughnessy
  Are there traits in investors that you think matter more in 2024 than they did in 2004?
  Graham Duncan
  It would basically be the same. Decisiveness, the open-minded with a point of view, like at a high level, that's the same. There are moments where, in 2008, 2009, we're like this, where you're on the field and the game itself changes in these structural ways. And people that can handle being comfortable with that level of change of, no, you thought you had cash in a bank. Actually, you don't. Oh, yes, you do. No, you don't. Those sort of movements of the game. I remember at the time, there were several managers who I would not have guessed felt wronged by... They were short. And when the SEC banned short selling, there was one guy in particular who just felt like that wasn't fair. It felt like the sentence underlying everything he said was, that's not fair. And that's a version of, I feel like trying to be right rather than making money. Like, what? Nothing's fair. It's not fair that you have a gazillion dollars and you're managing a hedge fund. Like, what? So I feel like if you told me there was some shift in, I don't know what it would be, but just in the game itself over the next five to 10 years, that it's useful to be so opportunistic and so Flexible that you're fine with that and you flow with it rather than getting stuck. And it matters more during periods of punctuated equilibrium.
  Patrick O'Shaughnessy
  Does AI scare you? What do you think about it? It's freaking me out lately, to be honest.
  Graham Duncan
  Scared and excited at the same time. Munger spoke at Sohn Australia a year before he died, and he had this amazingly poignant thing where he said, I was talking with Warren this morning, and we were both saying, like, if We could just watch what happens the next 30 years. And then he said, not even participate, just watch. Think how... Beautiful. Yeah i oscillate back and forth between fear around how my kids will navigate that reality and we as a society and then tyler cowan's frame of like number one it's happening no matter What yeah so get over it number two it's the return of history. There have been other eras that felt like this. And so that's how I try to rationalize it.
  Patrick O'Shaughnessy
  What would surprise people the most that aren't in the world of what I'll call the very high end of the investment game, where you have very talented, very smart, very aggressive, often Investors vying for edge, vying for talent, vying for whatever funds from LPs.

- **Wilderness Period**
  - After selling his news aggregation business, Graham Duncan experienced a period of uncertainty and experimentation.
  - He explored various business ideas, some of which failed, leading to self-doubt and external criticism.
  - This "wilderness period" was marked by multiple email addresses and a search for a central focus.
  - Duncan emphasized the importance of patience, not overemphasizing external validation, and trusting one's intrinsic motivations during such times.
  - He highlighted the challenge of tolerating ambiguity and embracing experimentation when facing financial pressures or familial responsibilities.

  What was graduation like from that business? What happened? What was the transition to the next thing?
  Graham Duncan
  We had the opportunity to sell it to one large news organization. The professor ultimately didn't want to sell it to them. I asked him to buy me out at that multiple, which he did. They ended up selling to the Financial Times a couple of years later. I was producing someone else's show. I wouldn't have had the language for it at the time, but I kind of wanted to try out being source and having my thing be at the center of it. I tried to start several businesses. There were failures.
  Patrick O'Shaughnessy
  It was like a wilderness period.
  Graham Duncan
  A wilderness period. I remember somebody giving me grief for how many different email addresses I had. And that really stung at the time. I was like, ah, yeah, he's right. Like, I've had like three email addresses in two years or maybe more than that, four.
  Patrick O'Shaughnessy
  And he was giving me shit about that. So then bring us home. So from that wilderness period, well, I guess maybe is there any other meta lesson from the wilderness period of just like wandering, trying to find the thing?
  Graham Duncan
  I think one would be just patience and not overweighting. If you're doing that at what Bob Keegan would call the socialized stage of your life, where you're really focused on approval of other people and where you are in the system and being Quote relevant, you got to make that as object as you can and not let it freak you out. Tom Morgan did this five minute talk at Sohn. Have you watched it? It's great. And he closes with one of your favorite quotes, I think on my Joseph Campbell, follow your bliss. There's a follow your bliss element to it and trusting the universe that if you get in touch with the thing you're compulsive about and that you love, the world will come to you. It's a trust fall and it's hard. And I remember during that period thinking, I'm very interested in people and information networks. There's an element of almost being an anthropologist. And we're like thinking, like, how does that fit in? I had that ignition around Dan Stern that we talked about who had run Reservoir. And so that was one compass point through that period.
  Patrick O'Shaughnessy
  One thing I think a lot about is in that swim, to use your back to your river analogy, after a long enough hard swim, you swim to the order side. And if I think about my own life, not having come from like crazy amounts of financial success or whatever early on, but I had enough support that I could keep swimming longer, like the Sort of nepotism of having worked for my dad and knowing that I probably, he wouldn't fire me was such an unfair advantage that I could swim longer without swimming to the order bank. I couldn't have taken as much risk. There's this great quote. I want to find it and read it exactly right. Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go. Yeah. Does that feel like that wilderness thing? Like, is it related? Yeah.
  Graham Duncan
  The tolerance for the ambiguity, the willingness to take risk, to not play within on somebody else's board. Yeah. But I think you're right that it's a nice image of you try chaos and then you go back to order as a default. And then you try chaos, and it's like a repeat iteration game. There's a quote I love from Michael Singer, who's a spiritual teacher of sorts. And he says, eventually, you will see that in the way of the Tao, you're not going to wake up, see what to do, and then go do it. In the Tao, you are blind, and you have to learn how to be blind. You can never see where the Tao is going. You can only be there with it. I think there's something like that. It's like the tolerance to be blind and not know and just experiment and figure something out is very hard to do at any stage of life, but particularly when your rent is due or you have a Family or you have financial obligations.
  Patrick O'Shaughnessy
  So that is in that same token. We talked a little bit about the origin story of East Rock itself, starting with, I think, $50 million from Stewart and then growing from there. Maybe tell just a quick version of that origin story and what was going on in your head and what your source was, what your vision was, what you wanted to accomplish, how it came together.
