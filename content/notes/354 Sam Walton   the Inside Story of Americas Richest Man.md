  And then in their research, they give a great overview of his life. And so it says he grew up in Missouri in the Depression. He worked his way through college, lived a clean Christian life, served stateside in World War II, married an Oklahoma banker's daughter, opened up his first five and dime store in Backwater, North Central Arkansas, and raised four healthy kids. And then this is my favorite part of this entire section. Pretty darned ordinary. But only on the surface, Sam Walton underneath was no ordinary man. He was a genius in business with an iron mind and unwilling to compromise any of his carefully thought -out principles. And one of the most remarkable things about Sam is just how simple his idea really was. And he says it's a very simple idea. I'm going to buy cheap, I'm going to sell low, I'm going to do that every day. I'm going to do it with a smile and focus on service. And one of the benefits that Sam Walton had early in his career was that there's a tendency for people to confuse a simple idea with an ordinary person. And Charlie Munger, who extensively studied Sam Wong, hit upon why a simple idea taken very seriously is so powerful in business. Charlie said, in business, we often find that the winning system goes almost ridiculously far in maximizing and are minimizing one or a few variables. And so most of what I want to talk to you about today is just how long it took Sam to find his path and how messy it was.

Sam’s work at jc penny and this is when he learns how to be cost conscious you can make a lot of mistakes but survive if you control costs.

- Innovative Customer Attraction Strategy
  Summary:
  A store owner successfully applies JC Penney's customer satisfaction obsession to his small store by using unconventional methods to attract customers.
  By investing in an ice cream machine and a popcorn machine, he draws in families and farmers, converting them into customers. Through this strategy, he ensures customer satisfaction, prompting them to return and spread the word.
  Despite only converting a small percentage of these customers, the investment in the machines yields a great return on investment.

  He's like, well, I'm just going to take the obsession with customer satisfaction that JC Penney had, and I'm just going to apply it to my own little five and dime store. And so he's trying to figure out ways to like drum up business. And this is the first sign of something that Sam, Sam Strowman, he's like, very much like a PT Barnum. He's got the charisma of a southern preacher. And so he's constantly experimenting with these less conventional ways to attract more customers into the store. And you wouldn't believe how some of these really simple ideas were so effective. So he spent a bunch of money on an ice cream machine. People were like, what the hell are you doing? It's a crazy idea. And he'd put it out in front of his store, and on the weekends, families and all the farmers and all the people in this rural area, they would mob his ice cream machine and then some of them Would come into the store and then turn into customers. And then he'd obsess over their customer satisfaction. So then he'd make sure they return and then if they return, they're going to tell their people. And so, you know, five and a half years from now when he loses this store, it is by far the most successful. I think he's tied for in all the Ben Franklin franchisees if I'm not mistaken. So he's like, oh, the ice cream worked. What else can I do? Then he buys a popcorn machine, does the same thing, puts out the popcorn. Same exact thing happens. He's like, oh, there's different ways to draw attention to the store than just by saying, hey, you know, 50% off or buy one, get one free. He's finding another way to attract customers. And even if he only converts a small percentage of the people that buy ice cream, the people that buy the popcorn, it's still a great return on investment for buying a popcorn machine And ice cream machine.

    - **Note:** Sam runs Ben Franklin store like a 5 and dime with great service and uses attractions like ice cream and popcorn to draw people in unique marketing and high customer satisfaction. Sam gets his store taken away because of a mistake he made about the lease and had to start again from scratch then his mom dies unexpectedly he build from the ground up buys a Ben
      Franklin in bentonville and then is still running the old one commuting 8-10 hours realizes on these drives he can run 2 why not more and builds and scales his system. He also starts flying to save time which was key to his operation this allowed him to visit more of his and his competitions stores than anyone so he could constantly learn and improve. Shop your competition. They were constantly undercapitalized and needed to find unique growth. Learnings at Ben Franklin stores like bigger stores even in small areas lead to more money was a key learning that applied to Walmart. When he’s doing stuff he’s constantly learning and stealing stuff and this when he discovers discounting. He stole his competitors ideas. Stole k Mart model did it in small cities they got fat and lazy that allowed Sam to win. He tried to pitch Walmart to Ben Franklin board and they say no.

  You cannot sell a bagless vacuum cleaner to people to make 500 million a year selling vacuum bags. You cannot sell the idea of discounting at a lower margin and saying, hey, sell me your stuff at 12 .5 % and selling instead of selling it to me at 25 percent. How do you think they paid for those tailored suits and those custom shoes with that 25 percent margin? And so they laugh them out of the room. And then there's a great story that is told in this book. It's also told in Sam Walton's autobiography. The very next day one of the Ben Franklin executives goes and checks out He's like, maybe I should go check out this new Kmart thing that this crazy Sam Walton fella is talking about and Here's a description of what happens He got a surprise Sam Walton was there ahead of him. Here. He was 25 miles from our office and he was talking to a clerk He was writing in a little notebook and at one point he got down on his knees to look under the display cabinet. I said, Mr. Walton, what are you doing? And he said, it's just part of the education process, Don, I'm still learning. And so Sam talks about this time. It's not like he thought discounting was the future, right? But he wasn't sure if he could do like he was going to succeed at it. He knew he could. He was really good at the variety store business. But he decides I'm just going to experiment. He's constantly experimenting. And he talks about this, the way he describes this point of his life, he has a great term on he says, I was thrashing around for the right way to go.

    - **Note:** Sam present Ben Franklin bord with Walmart idea they thought he was crazy said no they had a cash machine were incentivized to see the future. Constantly learning through observation. first store was profitable from day. One is a simple plan and continuously improves. Walmart is focused on customer satisfaction when someone returns a pair of shoes and exchange them then gives them socks free too. There was no process earlier they were just expanding as fast as they could and growing like Disneyland no process they just had to figure things out themselves Sam expanded around hubs so it would never take a truck more than 5-6 hours to get from a distribution center to a store. Sam was very nice to frontline workers but a slave driver to his executives demanded a lot. He worked them crazy hard. He was always in debt early needed to go public then be never had capital issues again. Sam left brought in a new ceo but couldn’t stay away and came back.

  He could expect to work harder and put in more hours than ever before in his life. And now we get to one of the most mind -blowing things that happens in the book, at least mind -blowing to me. Remember he was talking about the fact that he's not resistant to change. Now he has his principles he's not going to deviate from, but he always wants the best ideas. And he repeats over and over again. You know, he says, R .C. Is that formula, resistance to change. Like we want a low resistance to change, we're willing to change. It's a trademark of like the Walmart culture, the Walmart philosophy. Every day is a different situation in the retail business. We have to be flexible. These are things that Sam Walton would repeat. Now, this is insane what they do here. The size of the investment. So at first, this is 1979, okay? At first, his team is top executives people he trusts. They're like, we need computers, we need help. The business is like, it's too unwieldy. We need more organized data, we need to make better decisions. And at first, Sam thought computers were just overhead. But then he listened, and he learned, and he changed his mind, and more importantly, and he invested. He put his money where his mouth was. Finally, his lieutenants educated and convinced Sam and Walmart plucked down $500 million for a modern communications computer system. And when they say computers, this time in, is like giant IBM mainframes. And so now all the Walmart stores, the warehouses and the distribution centers are able to communicate in real time.

    - **Note:** Sam was willing to change his mind when he first heard of computers. He thought they were useless overhead, but then he realized how valuable they could be to his operation and integrated them everywhere. Embrave technology. The computers gave him all the data from all the stores which was incredibly valuable in making decisions. He’s 61 years old when he changes his mind and invests 500mm in this initiative to support this initiative. He manages by walking around and constantly needed to see from the front. Sam gave his Walmart stock away when it first opened due to state planning advice from his father-in-law so there were no taxes paid when the shares were given they were worth 5k max very forward thinking. He’s using planes to see more. He expanded through organic and acquisition. Constantly learning extreme patientence and bias for action. He would wait to see what worked then scale like hell. He saw his first price club new it was a good idea and then deployed and generated almost a billion dollars from Sam’s club from 0 in 3 years saw the idea and ran like hell at it. Nothing is cheaper than a good idea without any action behind it.
