- Navigating Property Rights in Layered Blockchain Architecture
  Summary:
  Layer 2 solutions in blockchain architecture are on a journey towards achieving property rights comparable to Ethereum's Layer 1, which offers more robust guarantees against censorship and asset loss.
  The progression through stages—stage zero, stage one, and stage two—illustrates varying levels of property rights; stage two promises stronger protections. Stage two requires careful management of contract upgrades to avoid potential asset seizure.
  Specific guidelines outlined for contract upgrades include the necessity for multi-client implementations to ensure consensus, conditions for reverting control back to operators after downtime, and establishing delays before upgrades are enacted, allowing users time to withdraw assets if uncomfortable.
  The strength of an individual's property rights can be visually assessed through a metric system that categorizes L2 stages.
  Additionally, the censorship resistance of assets is critical; mechanisms exist that allow users to post withdrawal requests to Layer 1, ensuring transactions cannot be ignored by centralized sequencers on Layer 2. Together, these factors create a framework where the property rights on Layer 2 can be considered functionally equivalent to those enjoyed on Layer 1, thus enhancing user trust and engagement with Layer 2 solutions.

  So currently, let's say, do layer twos provide the same property rights as Ethereum'sorems layer one block space? You kept using this phrase stage two and of course if people want to understand what that means they can go to L2B Which tracks kind of the stage progress of all of these layer twos and the Case that you just mentioned Mike with blast Blast is basically stage zero. Yeah, okay. It's like along its decentralization journey So it does not have the property rights of the Ethereum mainnet has the ability to censor, has the ability to kind of like freeze in some Respects, but all of these layer twos should be on a journey towards full stage two, which imbues them with property rights that are similar, maybe not equal to, but pretty similar to The guarantees of Ethereum layer one block space. Now, there's a few things we could get into there in terms of like some people doubt whether layer twos will actually ever get to stage two. Others don't think that stage two actually imbues the same level of property rights as a theorem layer one. But let's park on this for a second. Can we define what exactly stage two actually means and how a layer two achieves that and whether any of these are close? Right.
  Speaker 1
  So stage two is fundamentally asking the question of what does it take to change the L1 contract that represents the view of the L2 according to the bridge on Ethereum's L1.
  Speaker 2
  Is it like stage two is like what kind of control does the Ethereum layer one have over the Ethereum layer two?
  Speaker 1
  More like what type of control do people in the real world have over the bridge that represents the state of the L2? Right now basically being able to upgrade that contract is essentially the equivalent of being able to play God. If you bridge your assets into that contract, and then someone just upgrades the contract to send all the assets to their own account, then your property is gone. And that's something that is kind of fundamentally broken about having contracts that are upgradeable, at least upgradeable in the sense that they are now. So Vitalik kind of laid out a few specific guidelines for how the contract upgrade must go through, like what preconditions need to be met in order for a contract upgrade to happen. One of those preconditions is you have multiple client implementations that disagree on the state, given the same set of transactions. So this is kind of like using the multi-client approach to say, hey, if there's a bug and we don't actually know what the new state is, then we defer back to a security council where they Can upgrade the contract. This is almost a worst case scenario fallback mechanism to save everyone's assets if the bridge is giving wrong results. He also lays out some ideas around if the roll-up goes offline for seven days, then this is like the roll-up is stuck. It's no longer live. You need to kind of grant access back to the bridge operators, to the people who run the actual roll-up to upgrade the contract. And then I guess the third bullet point he lists in there is that upgrades can happen, but only after like a long delay, such as 30 days. And the idea here is that any sort of long delay like this would offer the rollup consumers time to decide if they're going to bridge out or keep their assets in that L1 contract, right? So fundamentally, I have this choice where it's like, I see the upgrade happening, maybe they're going back to stage zero, maybe they're going back to blast mode of operation. I don't think I'm comfortable with that, so I'm going to do my exit and they give me like 30 days to kind of inform myself and make that decision. So obviously like in some ways this isn't purely the same as being able to just like lock away your eth and not touch it for 20 years and then wake up and you know move it kind of trustlessly. But I think the level of property rights that you can get at stage two are so close that it'll be equivalent in many regards and enough for people to trust using the L2s fully.
  Speaker 2
  So this whole stage zero, stage one, stage two thing, and also if we opened up layer two B, and we looked at all the pie slices that are either red, orange, or green, these are all measures Of an individual's property rights on this layer two. And so whether a layer two is at stage zero or stage two is a statement about how strong one's property rights are on this thing. And then you can, again, look at the pie slices. And if they're all green, then your property rights as an individual are pretty damn strong. If they're all red, then your property rights as an individual are pretty all week. But all of this is under this North Star umbrella of just evaluating property rights across this layered stack, right? Yeah.
  Speaker 1
  The bridge upgradeability and the stage two, stage one, stage zero stuff we were just talking about is kind of imbuing seizure resistance to L2 assets. Now, there's another very important thing to consider, which is actually censorship resistance of those assets, right? So the path here is I have some ETH on Ethereum mainnet, and I bridge it into the contract. And now I'm operating on the L2, but the only person who's able to sequence L2 transactions is a centralized entity. And they decide that they don't want to process my withdraw request. I have 10 ETH in there, and I want to withdraw it. I send them the transaction and they just drop it, they ignore it. Now, the way that rollups are designed to protect those assets and to give back that censorship resistance of the L1 is this idea of a forced transaction inclusion mechanism. So this is called different things on the different stacks, but the idea is the same, which is I can post a transaction to the L1, and know that even if the L2 sequencer ignores me and continues To ignore me, as long as that transaction lands on the L1, my withdrawal will get processed and I can take my ether out. And so this is kind of the fundamental protection against any arbitrary sequencer ignoring my wishes and kind of censoring me on that axis. So kind of with these two things combined, the stage two ability to like, trust that the contract can't get arbitrarily upgraded. And with the guarantee that I can always land a transaction on the L1 that will bridge my assets out from the L2 contract, I have like such bulletproof properties for my assets in L2 that They're functionally equivalent to assets on the L1.

  Speaker 3
  Mike, I guess your message today or your take on all of this is stay the course with the current roadmap, right? Ethereum roadmap is pretty good. Yeah. In terms of prioritizing for settlement and DA and execution, that's the first piece. And if we prioritize those things and layer twos are successful in creating economic GDP, then that will lead to ether the asset, a trueing continuous monetary premium, particularly As a store of value across the entire layer to economy. The summary and that's the take in response to some of the recent roadmap critiques that we've been hearing. Is that a good summary?
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, that's a great summary. I also think it's totally true that Ethereum is supercharged by diversity of thought. Having so many people invested in Ethereum space layer and so many people working to build out this future internet economy is part of what makes Ethereum great. I hope that this discussion encourages people to engage more and think through it. Also, the roll-up teams who are contributing to the base layer continue to have the same vision and goals for what Ethereum is trying to do.
  Speaker 3
  All right. Well, may the conversation continue and I'm sure it will. Mike, thank you so much for joining us today. Thanks for having me. Guys got to let you know, of course, you know, crypto is risky. So is a theorem. So our roadmaps, all of these things are risky, but we are. Yes. Sorry. Queen sacrifices.
