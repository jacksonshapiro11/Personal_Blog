### Highlights

- The myth of sisyphus Albert camus
  What do we decide to live. Life presents itself as if it should have a meaning but a lot of this is absurd like Sisyphus who is pushing this boulder up a hill only to have it fall down the next day. This is the absurdity and monotony of life and camus believes that the only way to stick it to god is to live despite the pointless monotony of life, but what if there is a higher calling of feel alive and transcending ourselves and situation by rising above that and living the life we want

    - **Note:** The way to achieve a good life is to transcend the monotony and have a life meaningful to do where you're not just part of the machine. Follow what you love and find meaning in it all. Life is meaningless but we find meaning by living the life we want
