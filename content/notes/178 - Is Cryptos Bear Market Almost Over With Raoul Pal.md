### Highlights

- The Probabilistic Framework for Crypto Trading. Where to get Qualititative Signals. 
  Key takeaways:
  - There is no single source of truth in investing; it's about creating a probabilistic framework.
  - Crypto Twitter can provide overall sentiment and potential opportunities, but it's important to evaluate emotions and threats behind narratives.
  - Looking for individuals who discuss interesting topics from a non-emotional standpoint can provide valuable insights.
  - Crypto Twitter can be toxic and filled with insults due to financial losses.

  One thing I appreciate about your perspective, Raul, is you seem to be a juggler of many signals. You've talked about you've got the Ether Bitcoin price chart. Maybe it's somewhere to your left on a screen or something. You looked at the liquidity indicators. And then you also talked about narratives. Where do you get some of the more social squishy signals from? Obviously crypto Twitter, but maybe an answer more precise than that would be great. If indeed investing is hard, there's so many more assets now. There's so many more potential bullish use cases that might emerge first and foremost out of crypto. Where are you looking in this fear of crypto information? Are you getting those kinds of signals from?
  Speaker 1
  Yeah. So what I'm trying to do here, using all of these things, there is no single source of truth, right? All we're trying to do is create a probabilistic framework. And the best we can build our probability set. And again, it's not a mathematical thing. It's kind of intuitively, if I've got all of these signals, then that's giving me a higher rate of conviction. So I tend to operate with crypto Twitter at two levels. One is overall sentiment. Who's killing who? Who's attacking who? Who's angry? Why are they angry? Right? It's not who and what they're angry about. It's why that really matters. And understanding whose narrative is under threat, how they're feeling emotionally threatened by something happening. What does that mean? Is there opportunities in this? Is there something informational of value? Then I try and look at the people and it rotates. It's not always, you know, because nobody has a source of truth and not everybody's right all the time. But you just start trying to keep an eye on people who are doing something interesting or thinking in different ways. And I think that becomes interesting. You know, there's people like Chris Benesky, who just kind of is not affected by all the noise and sticks to his own thing. Doesn't mean he's always right. But I find that very interesting. You know, people are after Hayes. Arthur's pretty good at this kind of stuff as well. Doesn't mean he's always right. But he's building a thesis. You know, he's bought a thesis around NFT platforms and then stuff like DEXs and what you could do there. Interesting macro thesis, looking for supporting evidence, stuff like that. So I try to look for people who talk about interesting stuff from a non-emotional standpoint that's driven by a deeper understanding of the space that's not just because they're actively involved in it. But something about, you know, this is why I think it's interesting. Here's the application and here's what I'm seeing. That becomes very interesting to me. And then Crypto Twitter on top is just the monkeys throwing poo at each other. And you just see who they're throwing poo at and why. And you drive some signal from that. Yes. Because increasingly I'm having a hard time with that. Well, it is because, you know, NFT Twitter has been busy destroying each other. Bitcoin Twitter has been also just reshuffling its own narrative, which is actually great to see. I agree. Really, really positive to finally to see a change of narrative for that ecosystem. That's great. ETH doesn't really have a new narrative yet because we haven't seen a new application come. So it's like it works. It's got its yield. It does its thing. But we don't have a new narrative. Most places in the space are still missing narratives. So that's why everybody's feeling a little bit under threat and hates each other for anything anybody says. But it's, you know, Crypto Twitter is still very toxic. You can't say anything without somebody criticizing you for something you've said. And not in a normal, debative fashion, but just it's just insult after insult after insult. And because people are losing money, and as soon as they lose money, they get angry.
