### Highlights

- Quality vs Quantity of Sleep States
  Summary:
  If you are learning something or have an emotional day that you will get more REM sleep, it's homey static. You don't need to worry about it. Your body will get it if it needs it. If you go to bed too late, you'll actually miss the window for that deep slow brain cleaning sleep. And the sleep you'll get is more REM sleep.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  You know, actually one of the things that we don't know yet is whether quantity is equivalent to quality, right? And so more is not necessarily better. In fact, there are some sleep disorders where people have hypersomnia, hypersomalence, or too much REM or REM too early in the night. So it's also the timing relationship between the sleep states that seems to be important. If you are learning something or have an emotional day that you will get more REM sleep, it's homey static. It's automatic. You don't need to worry about it. You'll get it. Your body will get it if it needs it. And so if you're learning a lot and you need more REM sleep to consolidate that, it will get more REM sleep at the cost of other states of sleep. If you can just sleep longer than those other states of sleep don't have to suffer in addition to it. In the first half of the night, you get more of that deep slow waves, you know, cleaning sleep. And in the second half of the night, toward the wee hours of the morning, you get more REM sleep. So I sat on average. You go through all those states sleep within 90 minutes. But in fact, in the first half of the night, more of that 90 minutes is spent in deep slow wave sleep and less in REM sleep. And in the second half of that night, more of that 90 minutes is spent in REM sleep and less in deep slow wave sleep. So if you go to bed too late, you'll actually miss the window for that deep slow brain cleaning sleep. And the sleep you'll get is more REM sleep.

    - **Note:** Deep sleep happens early in the night and rem sleeps happens before you wake up. So you can miss your window for these things in a night.
- The Impact of Sleep Deprivation on Immune System and Learning - Research Findings
  Summary:
  The first thing that happens with no sleep, one night, is our natural killer sounds get upregulated. Our immune system goes on high alert and says what to pay attention to. That helps protect us from any kind of acute insults but also makes us unable to learn from those things. If you're exposed to a virus, for example, you aren't as able to rally your soldiers,. Your immune soldiers to fight that virus. And so you'll probably get sick.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  There's a couple of great researchers. Mark Op is one of them. He's at the University of Colorado Boulder. And Jim Kruger, he's at Washington State University. They've done a lot of really good studies to show that our immune system is definitely compromised. The first thing that happens with no sleep, one night, is our natural killer sounds get upregulated so because it's a highly stressful situation for our bodies not to get a night sleep. And so our immune system goes on high alert and says what's going on, what do we need to pay attention to. And so that's good. That helps protect us from any kind of acute insults that day. But it also makes us unable to learn from those things. So we'll learn from whatever immune challenges that you had during that day. And if you're exposed to a virus, for example, you aren't as able to rally your soldiers, your immune soldiers to fight that virus. You will not be able to generate the specific soldiers to fight that specific virus. And so you'll probably get sick.

    - **Note:** Sleep has a massive effect on immunity.
- Lessons learned from a mother - common sense and fighting spirit
  Summary:
  My mother had best was common sense. She met challenges with, with equanimity and reached out to others when we needed help. "She never just sat down and let the world happen to her," he says.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  She's very strong, a lot of common sense, and eventually she was able to get go back to school for herself. And once we got old enough and could be left at home while she went to night school. And then when I was in college, she went to college as well. She got a master's degree in public health and she was a hospice social worker.
  Speaker 2
  What would you say is the most important lesson you learned from her that you still think about all the time today?
  Speaker 1
  My mother had best was common sense. And just a very rational, even-handed approach to the world, she was not a radical in any sense of the word. She, you know, went to bed a regular time every night. She met challenges with, with equanimity and reached out to others when we needed help. And she was a fighter, she's, she was strong. She never just sat down and let the world happen to her. She got out there and especially for kids sake, she fought for us and made sure that we got what we needed. ([Time 0:56:05](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b3469ea9-034e-4840-865d-a391fcfd8550))
    - **Note:** Importance of maintaining common sense and rationality in all states and remaining resilient in the face of adversity.
- The Importance of Accurate Brain Measurements in Studying Sleep
  Key takeaways:
  - The accuracy of our hypotheses and results is limited by our tools' ability to measure
  - Studying the brain and sleep is challenging due to ethical constraints on invasive methods
  - Developments in measuring tools may improve our understanding in the next decade
  - Science is a difficult but rewarding puzzle where each published paper is a piece
  - The bigger picture may not be clear when research is initially conducted
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  When it comes to anything, our hypotheses and our results are sort of only as good as our tool's ability to measure. And with the brain and sleep, I mean, you know, it kind of feels like we're looking at it from a mile away. Because nobody wants to let us like drill into their head as well as they sleep, I would imagine. So it'll be interesting to see how that develops over the next 10 or 15 years, you know, where are we on the right track and where are we totally wrong. And on that note, you know, you have a lot of up and down ideas, right? You have a hypothesis, you test it, you discover something completely different. I wonder if you can talk to me about some of that journey. Oh, yeah, absolutely.
  Speaker 1
  That's really the fun of science and science. You know, science is like building a giant puzzle that's really difficult, but really rewarding. So every paper that we publish is just one piece of that puzzle. And we don't always know when we come up with a piece where it fits in the bigger picture. And so we actually sometimes think that it fits with this other thing. And I don't know if you've ever built a puzzle before, but sometimes you think, oh, this piece to go together and they don't quite fit. But you think, you know, they've got to fit and you sort of mash it together. And it's not until you have more pieces of the puzzle that you realize, oh, no, this other piece goes there. And that one actually still doesn't belong anywhere, but eventually we're going to find, you know, these for it. So it's not like anything that we come up with, if we have rigorous approaches to it is wrong. It's just we don't always know where things fit. So sometimes papers get published and not cited. And so they are considered low impact papers because for 20 years, no one knows what to do with that knowledge. But the good thing about publications and the record is that they are sitting there. And someday someone will say, well, what about that? And they'll find that paper and say, oh, that fits perfectly with this portion of the puzzle that I'm building. And so for me personally, the way I've come up with some discoveries is because I had a hypothesis that was completely wrong. And in fact, so one of them is that I thought that if REM sleep is for remembering this memory structure of our hippocampus will. ([Time 0:59:30](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a77b9ad6-36c3-457a-b70c-cb410995b2da))
    - **Note:** Science is like building a puzzle and every paper is a piece of the puzzle. Some research is done and doesn’t seem to fit into the current puzzle but years down the line can be unearthed and be very relevant. Mendelian genetics ect. The world sometimes needs to be ready for science and science needs to be ready for the world. Nothing is wrong we just need to find the fit as long as the science is good
- REM Sleep and Memory Formation: The Brain's Ability to Prioritize Information
  Summary:
  The phase at which the cells that are involved in learning something brand new were firing is consistent with REM sleep serving a function for remembering and better remembering. The brain somehow knew whether it was important to forget this thing because now it's remembered somewhere else or to remember it because it not has not yet been consolidated. That blew me away. I had no idea. And it took me another. Actually, it's been 20 years that I still don't know the mechanism. But I have a brilliant graduate student who's now able with the tools that we've got now. We're all going to be wrong. Putting our egos to bed is the first thing to do.

  Speaker 1
  But the phase at which the cells that are involved in learning something brand new were firing is consistent with REM sleep serving a function for remembering and better remembering. So that's the brain telling me that my hypothesis was way too simple. It wasn't one or the other. But in fact, the brain somehow knew whether it was important to forget this thing because now it's remembered somewhere else or to remember it because it not has not yet been consolidated. And that blew me away. I had no idea. And it took me another. Actually, it's been 20 years that I still don't know the mechanism. But I have a brilliant graduate student who's now able with the tools that we've got now. Michelle Frazier to actually answer that question that we've had for the last 20 years of how it's possible that two cells set of located right next to each other, but encoding different things can fire at opposite phases.
  Speaker 2
  That's incredible. I love that journey and sort of like adapting to the data and being open to it in terms of, you know, I thought this, but now it's this and changing your mind. How do you approach things with that mentality where it's easy to change your mind?
  Speaker 1
  Well, first of all, you have to put your ego to bed because we're all going to be wrong. If we are striving and hot on the trail of something that's real, we have to be open to the fact that we can be wrong and that our hypothesis will always be too simple because our brains are complex. That's one thing that everybody agrees on. And so our hypotheses about how it must work have got to be have to embrace that complexity. Putting our egos to bed is the first thing to do. ([Time 1:03:22](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e40c8599-0d04-4ecb-8336-3f0415c335e6))
    - **Note:** How to be a good scientist. Adapting quickly and willing to change your mind when needed. Mitigate ego maximize likelihood of being right. Truth seeking. The world is very complex and we don’t know a lot.
