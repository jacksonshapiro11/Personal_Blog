### Highlights

- When I started managing, I felt a strong obligation to be the best [lead](https://every.to/c/leadership) I could for the team. [Managing](https://every.to/c/managing-people) is a big responsibility—and it’s especially challenging when some of your reports are 10 years older than you.
  It seemed to me that the best way to meet this responsibility was to wake up earlier and read something every day before I came in.
  As I started to read more, the question was whether to go deep or wide. I am curious about so many things, so I naturally gravitated to read widely. I strive to be T-shaped: *really* good at something, but with a wide foundation—and that’s a metaphor we use widely at Shopify.
