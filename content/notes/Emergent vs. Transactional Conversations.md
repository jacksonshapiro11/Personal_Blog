- Document Note: Based on the information provided in the document, it seems that there are no specific sources mentioned on how to create emergent conversations. However, the document suggests that creating space for emergent conversations can be facilitated by moving transactional conversations to asynchronous text, as Amazon does with their memo meeting culture. The author also mentions that they still haven't fully figured out how to create emergent conversations, but would love to hear any other tips. Overall, the document discusses the difference between emergent and transactional conversations and highlights the importance of emergent conversations in assessing the quality of relationships.

The author reflects on the difference between transactional and emergent conversations and how they affect the quality of relationships. They use examples from podcasts and business meetings to illustrate the qualities of each type of conversation. Emergent conversations are those that allow for spontaneity and co-creation, while transactional conversations are focused on specific goals and outcomes. The author suggests that relationships with more emergent conversations tend to be of higher quality and provides tips for facilitating more of these types of conversations.

1. What is the author's main argument about emergent vs. transactional conversations?
2. How does the author suggest improving relationships through emergent conversations?
3. Can you think of any personal experiences where you have had either emergent or transactional conversations? How did they make you feel? 
- Summary: The author reflects on the differences between transactional and emergent conversations, using examples from podcasts and business meetings. Transactional conversations are predictable and uninspiring, with a strict agenda and pre-determined outcomes. Emergent conversations, however, offer room for creativity and spontaneity, with no strict agenda and the potential for co-creation. The author suggests that relationships lacking emergent conversations are in trouble, and recommends facilitating these types of conversations as a way to improve relationships. One possible way to do this is by moving transactional conversations to asynchronous text.

### Highlights

- There is no strict agenda but plenty of time to talk about current problems and bottlenecks.
  It’s far more fun and productive than our daily standup.
  Now that I’ve noticed this pattern of transactional vs. emergent conversations I see it everywhere.
  It’s a great way to assess the quality of relationships.
  When there are little to no emergent conversations in a relationship it’s in serious trouble.
  This is true for romantic relationships, for friendships, and business relationships.
  But the cool thing is that this observation immediately suggests how to turn things around.
  When you want to improve a relationship, make more room for emergent conversations and fasciliate them in whatever way you can.
  I still haven’t fully figured out how to do this.
  But a useful first step is to move transactional conversations to asynchronous text.
  Amazon is doing this with their [memo meeting culture](https://commoncog.com/working-backwards/).
  This at the very least creates space where emergent conversations can happen. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpdg9cmrm08jmgrr0gdnvj05))
