- How Steve Jobs Used Social Proof to Get a Sales.
  Key takeaways:
  - Social proof is used today in marketing to persuade people to buy products.
  - Steve used social proof to convince the seniors at his high school that George was interested in buying the blue box.
  - This tactic worked because the seniors were curious and wanted to know what the blue box was.

  Speaker 1
  Social proof is used today in marketing. Richard Chotten, a marketing psychologist, added a best selling sign to a beer in a London pub and increased its sales by 2.5 times. However, social proof is notoriously hard to use for products that aren't popular. This is a problem for Steve. He can't say the blue box is a best seller because no one has bought it. So Steve uses social proof in a different way. What he did is he went into the dorms of other seniors at high school and he'd say, is George here? Now the seniors would often say no because there was no one called George there. They would say no, why? And Steve Jobs would say, ah, George was interested in buying the blue box. No problem. I'll come back later. Now in most cases, as for Steve could leave, the seniors would stop him and ask him what was the blue box. Steve would then start his pitch and in most cases he would get a sale. This is a genius tactic, one that some of the best sales people use today. Now obviously George doesn't exist, but that doesn't matter. Milly suggesting that someone is interested in buying your product will pique the interest of others. What's impressive is that Steve intuitively knew this at just 16 years old. It takes some salespeople decades to discover a tactic like this. Steve knew how to persuade and manipulate people at a young age. He might not have known he was using social proof or conditioning, but he knew what worked.
