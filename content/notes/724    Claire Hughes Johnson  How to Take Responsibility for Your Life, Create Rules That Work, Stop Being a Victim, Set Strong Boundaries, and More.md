### Highlights

- Episode AI notes
  1. Providing feedback to direct reports can be challenging, especially in a business context where some individuals struggle in professional settings despite excelling in personal conversations.
  2. Fear of negative outcomes, such as an employee quitting abruptly, may hinder people from delivering messages properly to team members.
  3. The speaker acknowledges the need to revisit the topic of providing feedback and relates it to the concepts of victim vs. player from Fred Kaufman. ([Time 0:00:00](https://share.snipd.com/episode-takeaways/16319bf2-d999-48b5-b162-8e5ea03e9b28))
- What’s the ekephant in the room people don’t want to bring up. Victim vs player. Are you taking agency of ceeding it. You need to get out of the victim mindset and be self aware. Write a working with me document. Make the implicit explicit. Create an inclusive environment when someone asks you for something ask when they need to know the answer by a listen for the quiet no don’t commit to anything emotionally in the moment step back and think. Make commitments then renegotiate them. Leadership is disappointing people at a rate they can absorb. Don’t ask people questions for negative feedback ask if they’re top 20% top 10% ect of people they’ve worked with. Take personality tests to understand yourself and your default operating settings. Be good at saying no. Spend more time with top performers ([Time 0:19:59](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c78591e0-fbd1-4500-a758-e6bf40cb3132))
