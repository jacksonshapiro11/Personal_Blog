  Speaker 1
  So, before he leaves, he registers an official trading firm with the county of Smallland and names it, very creatively, the natural thing that comes to mind, very descriptive term. He names it his name and his mailing address. Ingvar Kamprad Elmterud Agunyard. I-K IKEA.
  Speaker 2
  Ah, I never put together it was like his mailing address. I always knew it was the two initials of his name and the farm and the city. Well, I think that was his mailing address.
  Speaker 1
  Ah, that makes sense. You know, this is the countryside here. It's not like there's any more to the address than like Elm Tarud Gugnard. He doesn't have a house number. So cool. So that's IKEA.
  Speaker 2
  That's Ingvar Comprad's trading firm. This is it. And he does put the first IKEA logo sign on like a little shed on the property. It's simultaneously labeling the property by address then, in addition to saying this is where IKEA does business.
  Speaker 1
  Yes, which is all part of the lore. ([Time 0:18:06](https://share.snipd.com/snip/648e7a93-3f80-4471-8dea-746d2343585a))
- Strategic Beginnings Shape Future Success
  Summary:
  Ingvar Comprad's initial steps in establishing IKEA were marked by strategic branding and resourcefulness.
  By placing the first IKEA logo on a shed, he effectively labeled both the property and the venture, enhancing its visibility. His subsequent enrollment in the School of Commerce provided access to valuable trade publications, which facilitated outreach to suppliers across Europe.
  This proactive approach to securing agency agreements laid the groundwork for IKEA's future expansion and success in the retail market.

  Speaker 1
  Yes, which is all part of the lore. I'm not sure how much actually happens in the shed besides he puts the sign up there. I think he just stores inventory there. Yeah. Well, let's talk about inventory. Ingvar goes off to the School of Commerce, and for the first time there, he's able to do what I think he intended, which was get access in the school library to real, actual trade publications, Import-export trade papers and trade publications. So he starts writing to the suppliers all over Europe who are listed in these trade publications, and asks if he can become a selling agent of theirs in Sweden. ([Time 0:18:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/60d573dd-b562-4721-afee-3e4ecc6ed6f5))
    - **Note:** He basically traded pens into ikea. Never took out debt. Eventually he won. Mission driven. He starts as a distributor buying in bulk and selling. Then creates a catalog like Sears. Sees other people selling furniture in their catalogs decides to himself. Has local suppliers which is good but he has to deliver which isn’t a problem for him. By shopping competition finds love for furniture. There was limited availability for furniture in these areas. So the traveling sales people came by with a limited selection and charged as much as they could. IKEA had a large selection and wanted to sell cheap. Selling lowest price was massive. Also cut out the middle man and just optimized price in every way. Had a show room which was his unique competitive advantage. They focused on quality but other people didn’t and you couldn’t just return these things so if you bought something shitty you were stuck. This means they need to prove their quality or else they could make shit stuff. It’s al lay a disincentive for quality with the sight unseen buying. So price is just low and no one can prove anything. This is his big innovation and people come from all over to see and test the products. That’s where the hotel and restaurant come from because these people need to travel.
- Transform Experience into Exhibition
  Summary:
  IKEA's pioneering approach transformed the retail experience by combining mail order with a physical showroom, creating an exhibition-like atmosphere that attracted customers from across the country to Elmhult.
  Despite being in a remote town, the opening of the showroom drew over a thousand enthusiastic visitors, highlighting the effectiveness of extensive marketing campaigns and the innovative inclusion of food as part of the experience. This model emphasized the importance of enticing potential customers through a catalog, encouraging them to engage with the IKEA brand narrative.
  The initial showroom concept, along with targeted discounts and incentives for visitors, tapped into customer desire for a relatable lifestyle, ultimately driving significant sales growth.
  Notably, the business achieved remarkable sales milestones with a lean operational structure, underlining the success of effectively merging product display with customer experience.
  This strategy not only solidified IKEA's brand identity but also set a precedent for how retail could engage consumers, reflecting Ingvar's vision that redefined traditional mail order practices and established a new retail paradigm.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  A, there's the obvious, you can't take it home. B, the whole point of the mail order business was that buyers and sellers can now access each other across the whole country, all of Sweden as a market, all the rural areas everywhere In the country. And Sweden is a pretty big geographical country. What Ingvar is doing here, they're opening a showroom in one singular remote part of this country, you know, in a town with like a thousand people who live there. And their business model is to sell to the other towns of a thousand people all over the rest of the country. Why on earth would opening one showroom in one little town work? Here's the thing. I mean, by God, does it work? I don't know that the customer base in the town of Elmhul was that important to IKEA itself. People come from all over the country to go to the showroom. This is wild. So Ingvar advertises that they're opening this for months leading up to the actual opening, which is in March of 1953. So all of his customers and everybody getting the circular advertisements in the weekly paper all across the country, they're hearing about this showroom in Elmholt. On opening day in March of 1953, there are over a thousand people from all over the country who show up and wait in line to get in, like take the train. They somehow make their way to Elmholt to see the furniture. They're not even buying anything. It's crazy. Ingvar and the team, like they're so worried about this that they don't know that the floorboards on the second floor of this old joinery are like, you know, it's like an old building Here. They're like going to stand up to a thousand people being up there, plus all the furniture that they have as, you know, the showroom. They had also advertised in the circulars that they were going to offer free coffee and morning buns to anybody coming to shop. Yes.
  Speaker 2
  The very first time there's food at an Ikea is the very first time there's an Ikea. That's right.
  Speaker 1
  It has always, always been part of the concept. But yeah, Ben, as you say, there's no warehouse. There's no flat pack furniture. Everybody's just there to see the stuff. And you could also fill out an order form while you're there to then buy it by mail later.
  Speaker 2
  So Ingvar has a quote about this. At that moment, the basis of the modern IKEA concept was created. And in principle, it still applies. First and foremost, use a catalog to tempt people to come to an exhibition, which today is our store. Come and see us in Elmahut and convince yourself, we wrote on the back of the first catalog, two very important words there, convince, and the other one is exhibition. Already they were seeing this idea and the fact that he marketed to the whole country and offered food. I mean, we're not just offering you a store that you can walk into and buy something. We are creating an exhibition.
  Speaker 1
  Yes, it is an experience. It's almost like you're getting a free ticket to this experience, this exhibition.
  Speaker 2
  Yes. Great retailers have more in common with P.T. Barnum than poor retailers. Totally. Oh, my God.
  Speaker 1
  So this is, I think, and Ingvar thinks and he writes this, this is the very first time anywhere in the world that a mail order business is combined with a physical showroom. So you might think, oh, Sears in the U.S. Obviously, that's a mail order business and they have Sears stores. No, no, no. They're different. Like the Sears stores, you buy the stuff at the stores and you walk out. It's not a showroom. Here with IKEA for the first time, it is that concept you just described, Ben. It's like, we tempt you to come see this exhibition and then you order by mail. I don't think anybody had ever done this before because, again, it was a crazy freaking idea. But, of course, it becomes an enormous success. So within the first couple of years of the Elmhul showroom store, it's not a store being open, a huge portion of IKEA's catalog subscriber base, they've now formalized it as the IKEA Catalog. About half of their catalog subscriber base, which is hundreds of thousands of people now at this point in time, make the pilgrimage to El Mahul and they visit the showroom.
  Speaker 2
  You know, this tiny little village, hundreds of thousands of people are now coming there. And you might ask yourself, what's the big deal with the catalog? Like, why are people so interested in getting a catalog? It was really inspirational. I mean, it hadn't quite made the shift yet, but especially in the 60s after Britta Lange took over from Ingvar, because Ingvar is like everything right now. He's like art directing the photography. I think he might even be taking the pictures and writing the copy. But it turned into this thing with these vibrant, beautiful living room settings, and people are anticipating the arrival of the Ikea catalog. And it positioned Ikea as this brand, this lifestyle. It illustrated a life you could be living if you participated in the IKEA story.
  Speaker 1
  Yep. That really, really becomes a thing in the 60s with modernity and when the target customer becomes the urban and suburban customer. But even with the rural customer, like it's still working. They lean into this model heavily. So they arrange for any IKEA customer to get discount tickets on Swedish realways to make the pilgrimage to Elmhult. And then they also set up this program where customers who come from another location and commit to furnishing a whole house, they call these the setting up house customers. They get free dinner at the hotel in Elmhult that night. Like this is hokey stuff, but to your point, P.T. Barnum, that's what this is. So within a year, they pass 1 million kroner in sales at this showroom, which has got to be by multiples the largest business ever built in Elmholt in human history. In 1954, so the next year after this has been open, they passed 3 million kroner in sales. I think the exchange rate was about 5 to 1 at this point in time of 5 kroner to $1. 1955, they double again to six million in sales. The number of Ikea catalog subscribers around the country passes half a million. And all this is done with still less than 30 employees, the business still being run out of the combination of the family farm and this one showroom. It's wild the scale they get to. It's amazing. Yeah.
  Speaker 2
  So it's one of these things that, you know, on the one hand, we are how many years into Ikea? It was founded in 43, and we're approximately in 53, 54 here. So we're 10, 11 years in. But the thing that is really working is this thing that just got started the previous year, which is the combo of the catalog and the showroom. That proves to be this like amazing winning combination that they just realize, oh my God, we need to scale this. Yep, totally.
  Speaker 1
  This is, I would say like generation three of the IKEA business. You know, generation one is just small goods tra... ([Time 0:44:44](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e0a5f4ff-bb54-45a2-a2c8-e6f41054fa20))
    - **Note:** The showroom model was huge this exhibition was a massive innovation. Understood the demand so well. They put on a great experience. This was v3 of ikea after 10 years.
- Design to Overcome: Innovating Through Adversity
  Summary:
  IKEA successfully disrupts the fragmented furniture market by prioritizing low prices and appealing to a mass market.
  Their innovative approach hinges on in-house design and flat-pack furniture. By collaborating with suppliers to create exclusive designs, IKEA navigates competitive barriers raised by rivals.
  A pivotal moment occurs when they optimize designs for easier transportation, significantly reducing costs associated with shipping and assembly.
  This efficiency leads to a transformative shift in the furniture landscape, catering to modern urban living while reinforcing customer engagement through the self-assembly model.
  As the flat-pack concept gains traction, it not only enhances IKEA's affordability but also fosters a sense of accomplishment among customers, reinforcing brand loyalty. Moreover, distinguishing IKEA's minimalist Scandinavian design as a response to shifting consumer needs further solidifies their market position, suggesting that their success may also shape broader design preferences. The interplay between innovation, value creation, and design exemplifies how overcoming adversity can lead to sustainable competitive advantages in an evolving industry.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  And IKEA is philosophically trying to drive down prices. They want to create the furniture for the many, and their competitors are all trying to maximize margin and have kind of small businesses because the whole furniture landscape, in Fact, to this day, is very, very fragmented. It's tons of players serving niche local use cases. And so you've got the whole Swedish furniture industry that's pissed at Ikea for going to the furniture manufacturers and saying, what's the very best deal you can give me? And then turning around to customers and saying, I'm going to make very little margin and sell you all of this manufacturer's capacity at extremely low cost. So the competitors are feeling it from both sides. They're saying, okay, the manufacturers have no capacity to manufacture for me and no customers want my stuff because you're selling it cheaper.
  Speaker 1
  It's freaking wild. IKEA does not have a direct competitor today in 2024. There is not a single other globally scaled furniture business in the world.
  Speaker 2
  Put a pin in it. I have a thesis on why. Oh, OK.
  Speaker 1
  So what do the competitors do? They start locking IKEA out of trade fairs, trying to limit their access to suppliers. They start pressuring IKEA's existing suppliers into not selling to IKEA. They say, oh, we're all collectively going to boycott other orders from you.
  Speaker 2
  And IKEA is not yet big enough where that fails. That actually works. And the manufacturers just come to IKEA and say, sorry, the collective leverage of all your competitors is too large and we're not going to serve you. Yep.
  Speaker 1
  Competitors even go to the Swedish government and they lobby the Swedish government to limit IKEA's ability to circulate its catalog. I don't know on what grounds.
  Speaker 2
  This is like the most European thing ever that regulation should... This is too good for consumers. Yes, exactly.
  Speaker 1
  Oh man, we could make a million jokes about European regulation. Anyway, to your point, it starts to work and this becomes a real problem for IKEA. So Engvar, the company, they're like, all right, well, how are we going to design our way out of this one? And it turns out design is the answer. So they start going to the suppliers, to the furniture makers, and they say like, okay, we hear you that our competition does not want you to give your pieces to us like you're also giving To them. What we give you a new set of designs for different furniture and you make those designs just for us, separate line, open up separate lines? Could you do that? And most of them say, well, yeah, I think I could do that. And this is the beginning of IKEA in-house designed furniture. Now, the first quote-unquote designer who Ingvar sets to work on this is a former advertising draftsman named Gillis Lundgren. And Ingvar had hired him originally to help Ingvar do the set layout and the photo shoots for the catalog as his like assisting. Lundgren starts cranking out sketches of furniture designs for the manufacturers. And so then as legend has it, all this is going on. And then one night, the two of them, Lundgren and Ingvar, are taking down the set from a photo shoot. And Lundgren says, well, he's putting a table away. He's like, oh, God, this thing is so heavy. What a huge amount of space it takes up. Let's just take the legs off the table and put them under the tabletop and then we can store all this stuff better. And Ingvar is like a bolt of lightning has hit him. He's like, oh my God, I have just received like, you know, the last commandment from God about how to run this business. It's like, yes, we take the legs off and it takes up a lot less space. My God, we can design these things to come off on purpose. And then when we have our manufacturers ship the tables to customers, they're going to be able to fit a hell of a lot more of them in those trucks.
  Speaker 2
  Yep. And it's kind of apocryphal. I am sure something along the lines of this insight happened. There were many other companies that were doing flat-packed furniture before this, including the company we've talked about multiple times on this episode, Sears Roebuck, was flat-packing In their catalog distribution in America. But certainly the company that gets credit for popularizing and growing the volume of flat-packed furniture being shipped 100x, 1,000x around the world is IKEA.
  Speaker 1
  And it's a nice little story. But I think what IKEA does is they go all in on this. So the first flat-pack product that they design is the MAX table in the mid-1950s. But by the end of the 1950s, flat pack and then self-assembly by the customer is expanded across the entire range, like all of IKEA's furniture. Obviously, some stuff you can't flat pack, but like as much as possible. And because they had, for separate reasons, started doing their own designs with manufacturers, they can do this. Yep.
  Speaker 2
  So flashing forward a little bit to today, but it's interesting to look at all the downstream things that happen from flat packing. One, it enables this space saving in trucks. It enables you to do more volume for the same cost. Two, there's a cost reduction since customers can do the labor and transport. Before, you had to have someone at your company put the chair together, and that costs a lot of labor. Now you're putting that on the customer. You're also making it so the customer has the capability to transport the merchandise in a way that they couldn't before. They had to have a truck.
  Speaker 1
  Right. Mail order was the only way to make this happen. You're not going to drive away or get on a bus with a table. Yep, absolutely.
  Speaker 2
  There's a further cost reduction since it decreases the broken merchandise in transit. So there's this third amazing benefit to flat packing. Ultimately, they pass all this along to the customers, meaning now their products are definitely the least expensive on the market for their quality. And psychologically, it gives this feeling of accomplishment. It increases your fondness for whatever object you assembled because of the labor, the blood, sweat, and tears that you just put into it. You feel like, I made this. Yeah. We almost broke up, but we didn't. And four hours later, I have the cabinet together.
  Speaker 1
  One of the articles I was reading for research called it the Lego for adults. Totally. That's totally right. Yeah. Another great Scandinavian company. We'll have to cover it someday.
  Speaker 2
  I have a fun story for you, David, on Flatpak that I haven't told you yet.
  Speaker 1
  Ooh, light on me.
  Speaker 2
  So there's another word for this. Do you know what it is? Do you hear it anywhere? It's kind of an old school retailer merchant phrase.
  Speaker 1
  Ooh, no, I don't think I did. Knockdown.
  Speaker 2
  Ooh, no. And it was referred to as KD. So in preparation for this episode, I talked to Jim Senegal, who's the co-fou... ([Time 0:56:02](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fc7e975f-8c45-4a1d-be2c-fde6ad4f05d4))
    - **Note:** Flat packing turns their biggest disadvantage into and advantage and it’s an existential problem but leads to them winning. The movement to cities was also a massive tailwind. Perfectly positioned and great design then they expand to Europe
- Design for Affordability: The Hot Dog Philosophy
  Summary:
  Focus on designing products with an emphasis on affordability drives innovation and classifies offerings into 'hot dog products' that provide unbeatable value.
  Successful brands identify market gaps where they can introduce high-quality items at prices significantly lower than competitors, ideally using cost-effective materials and leveraging waste products. This strategy not only involves innovative manufacturing processes but also optimizes the entire supply chain.
  The creation of standout products, such as a $10 coffee table or the Pöang chair, exemplifies maintaining quality while achieving a remarkable price advantage.
  Additionally, a direct marketing approach through catalogs can effectively generate demand for these affordable products, creating a cycle of customer acquisition without relying on external advertising.
  However, the shift to an online marketplace has altered the control over the demand and supply chain that was once a hallmark of their success.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  I think that's a part of it, too, is it's supposed to have the form and design. It's not just build quality, but actually the form should be elegant to look at. Yes.
  Speaker 1
  But over and above just kind of like the standard products in the range, Ikea should always have a few products that are these breathtaking price products. And these products should also be high quality, but they should be priced at least 50% below any competitive or substitutive products out there. And ideally like well less than 50%. I mean, a $10 table today, that's breathtaking. That's astonishing. And so Ingvar says, like, it's our job to figure out, you know, start with that end goal in mind and then design backwards from that of like, how are we going to make that happen? And he would later write and describe the whole idea is based on the substantial price difference, the easily understood price by the consumer. We don't lose on the deal, nor do we make much profit, but at least we make a little. And in the end, that's what matters. We can't actually lose money on these products. And thus, we need to design, like, not just what the furniture looks like, the manufacturing process, the transport process, the raw material sourcing process, like everything end To end about how are we going to sell product as the whole supply chain?
  Speaker 2
  Yes.
  Speaker 1
  A $10 coffee table. And so the way they do it, at least in the case, the lack is like, we're going to wholesale reinvent the manufacturing technology process for this. We're not going to make a solid wood coffee table. We're going to use board on frame construction. And what are the raw inputs for that? Well, we can use the leftover scrap wood chips. And then eventually now I think it's like pulp material from the timber. That's actually going to be like 90 plus percent of the material that goes into the product is our waste products from our other things that we're making. A, that's super cheap. B, it's super lightweight, even though they're pretty solid and sturdy. And then C, we can just scale this indefinitely. Today, IKEA sells almost 20 million lakh tables every year and has been for decades. I mean, they've sold hundreds of millions of these things. So like you can optimize the freaking crap out of your whole supply chain to do this. That is wild. I think they have multiple SKUs at that scale. So later, once he, like Charlie Munger, got turned on to the virtues of Costco, Ingvar would hilariously formalize this idea, this manifesto, in 1995 as the hot dog product policy. Because in 1995, they copied Costco and they start selling hot dogs in the stores.
  Speaker 2
  Okay, so I brought this up with Jim when I was talking about similarities between Costco and IKEA. He did not believe that IKEA copied the Costco hot dog. And here was his rationale.
  Speaker 1
  There's no way. It's 100% a copy. I don't believe him.
  Speaker 2
  I know Ikea started doing it in 1995. There is a rich Swedish tradition in hot dogs. Swedish hot dog carts are freaking everywhere. I don't think you had to look at Costco to observe, we could probably sell hot dogs at a Swedish store.
  Speaker 1
  Jim is a very kind and generous soul, despite being one of the greatest retailers of all time. So I'm just going to chalk this one up to that. The IKEA hot dogs today are priced at $1, which is cheaper than the $1.50 at Costco. Well, no, David, the $1.50 is a combo. That's what I was going to say. I think, though, you can only get the $1.50 combo at Costco.
  Speaker 2
  Yeah. I mean, I don't know if you could walk up and try to order a hot dog that's less than a dollar, but it is $1.50 for a hot dog and a drink. And there's no menu item of just a hot dog.
  Speaker 1
  Right. We talked about all this on the episode. Like part of how they do this is including the drink. It's a bundling.
  Speaker 2
  Yeah.
  Speaker 1
  Anyway, I refuse to believe that the ability to buy just a hot dog at Ikea is not a nod to the Costco deal because Ikea also has the hot dog and drink combo for $150.
  Speaker 2
  And it's right after checkout, just like Costco's is. And it entered the store about a decade after Costco started selling the hot dog.
  Speaker 1
  There's no way. There's no freaking way that Ingvar wasn't just like, all right, we got to copy the hot dog. The even more amazing thing is he codifies this into the official policy of the company, which is we must have at least, at first it's 10 quote unquote hot dog products across the range. He later ups it to 20. And it's, yes, it's like the lack table. It's an impossible price for ideally one product in every category that we sell that is just, it's criminal not to buy this thing. Yeah.
  Speaker 2
  And the fact that they just keep whittling it down year over year over year. A great example of this is the Poeng chair. Yes. Another hot dog product. Absolutely. I think they've sold 30 million of these since 1976. They've just been binocul about optimizing. So the initial Poeng chair, which was originally called the Poem, not the Poong.
  Speaker 1
  I didn't know that.
  Speaker 2
  They had it down below $100, and it's effectively flattened out. It's now $130, but with a little bit more inflation. It's astonishing you can get this chair that is a living room chair for $130. Comparable chairs are like $2,000 to $3,000. Right.
  Speaker 1
  You're not going to buy a Poe-ang chair and have anybody mistake it for a Herman Miller recliner. No, but that's not what they're trying to be. But it's pretty darn close for the delta in price. I mean, a Herman Miller recliner is what, $5,000, I think? Something like that.
  Speaker 2
  Yeah, maybe this performs the same function, but you're not going to aesthetically mistake it for a Herman Miller chair.
  Speaker 1
  Oh, I guess my point is like the Delta in the design aesthetics is also way closer than $4,770.
  Speaker 2
  Yes, that's a great point. Has this wow price when you drive home with it you set it up you can marvel at the fact that it only cost you 130 yes okay which brings us to the other i think really uniquely ikea piece of this
  Speaker 1
  Hot dog policy that even Costco doesn't really have. I just love the hot dog policy. IKEA, thanks to the catalog, controls all parts of the demand and the supply chain. They control the supply chain, obviously, as we've been talking about. But the catalog for decades is the primary marketing and demand driving ([Time 1:11:49](https://share.snipd.com/snip/900f8b76-cf3f-4386-aa5c-258f83cd1df2))
    - **Note:** Create things at impossible prices. They make profit and get relentlessly resourceful on it. Breathtaking prices. They control the supply and demand. By the mid 60s the concept is basically formed.
- Thriftiness Fuels Global Expansion
  Summary:
  The company demonstrates a unique blend of rapid scaling and exceptional thriftiness, allowing it to expand into international markets like Canada, Australia, and Singapore without raising additional funds.
  Despite operating with thin profit margins, it leverages high volume sales to fuel future growth while adhering to strict cost management principles. Historical revenue growth highlights this approach, scaling from $20 million to $2 billion in about 15 to 20 years.
  This philosophy is embodied in the founder's belief that effective problem-solving must consider cost, emphasizing the importance of understanding expenses in designing products and solutions.
  The mindset equates profits with potential future investments, reflecting a long-term, compounding value perspective.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  They expanded to Canada, Australia, Singapore. I mean, Ingvar totally got conviction that the newly redesigned store in Stockholm was it, and we were going to copy-paste it and bring it everywhere.
  Speaker 2
  And they're rapidly scaling with profit dollars.
  Speaker 1
  Right. They're not raising money to do this. Yeah.
  Speaker 2
  As we've talked about, they have very thin profit margins. And so what it means is they are just doing tons and tons and tons of volume to enable them to do their future growth with their current profit dollars. Yep.
  Speaker 1
  It's hard to get consistent revenue data on the company because it's a private company still is a private company. But by the 1980s, they're doing $2 billion a year in revenue. So call it 15, 20 years to scale from $20 million to $2 billion.
  Speaker 2
  It's incredible. Yeah, it's interesting. It's a company that is rapidly scaling at the same time that in their DNA, they're unbelievably thrifty. You kind of wouldn't expect both of these things to be true of the same company. Totally. This is the same guy, like just to quote the testament of a furniture dealer, this is like one of my favorite paragraphs. Ingvar writes, it is not all that difficult to reach set targets if you do not have to count the cost. Any designer can design a desk that will cost 5,000 kroner, but only the most skilled can design a good functional desk that will cost 100 kroner. Expensive solutions to any kind of problem are usually the work of mediocrity. We have no respect for the solution until we know what it costs. An IKEA product without a price tag is always wrong. It is just as wrong when a government does not tell the taxpayers what a free school lunch costs proportion. Before choosing a solution, set it in attention to the details is also the same company that is in a decade expanding all over the globe.
  Speaker 1
  Because it's almost like Warren Buffett, you know, in the Berkshire Hathaway episodes where as a young man, he's like, I cannot spend any money because any money that leaves my bank Account will not compound. It's the same thing here with Ikea. They view all of the profits that they are making as like compounded value of future investment here.
  Speaker 2
  That's an interesting way to think about it. ([Time 1:36:06](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5a89bbd5-77c4-4593-8511-e7cdeb3e2bc4))
    - **Note:** They’re scaling the business with profits quickly. Very cost focused but also a ton of scale.
- Value Through Intentional Design
  Summary:
  A company's operational philosophy should be reflected in its product offerings, emphasizing well-designed yet functional items that maintain affordability for customers.
  Quality should be tailored to the intended use of each product, ensuring customers receive maximum value without unnecessary costs. A significant aspect of effective management is the realization that time is a precious resource, encouraging productivity in short time frames.
  Constant progression and the pursuit of improvement are vital, as resting on past achievements can lead to stagnation.
  This mindset fosters a culture of continuous innovation and engagement, essential for both personal and organizational fulfillment.

  Speaker 1
  In 1976, he writes this document that is intended to serve as sort of a like forever operating system of the company. It's almost like the Bezos leadership principles. Yes, exactly. That's exactly what it was like. And he titles it the Testament of a Furniture Dealer, as we've talked about. And literally, he's treating this like it's his last will and testament, even though he stays involved in the business for another 42 years and hands on the whole time. It's an amazing document. We'll link to it in the show notes. You should go read it. It's on the IKEA website. It's really cool. So it has nine testaments, sort of commandments, and you already read one, which was the mortal sin of wasting resources at IKEA. The first one, though, number one, the product range, our identity. We shall offer a wide range of well-designed functional home furnishing products at prices so low that as many people as possible will be able to afford them. Talked about that earlier. Our products must be functional and well-made, but quality must never be an end in and of itself. It must be adjusted to the consumer's needs. This is fascinating. He continues, a tabletop, for example, needs a harder wearing surface than a shelf in a bookcase. In the first example, a more expensive finish offers the consumer long-lasting utility, whereas in the latter, it just hurts the customer by adding to the price. Quality must always be adapted to the consumer's interests in the long term. No effort must be spared to ensure our prices are perceived to be low. There shall always be a substantial price difference compared to our competitors, and we shall always have the best value-for offers in every function. Every product area must include breathtaking offers.
  Speaker 2
  This is before the hot dog analogy in 95. It's great. It makes so much sense. It's so great. The analog to software companies is engineering for engineering's sake. There's many examples of sort of architecting the perfect system that's like wildly overkill. Anyone who's put together IKEA furniture knows anything that's not seen, like things on the bottom that face the floor or that face the wall, are not finished. And oftentimes, like the back of shelving units or the back of cabinetry is like thin, flimsy. You don't need it to be structurally stable. So it's not because they wanted to cut a corner there and make it as cheap as possible because they view that as a value for you, the customer.
  Speaker 1
  It's not that they don't care or that it's sloppy. They care a lot. Right.
  Speaker 2
  It's that it would be insulting to spend money on it.
  Speaker 1
  Yes, exactly. This is the polar opposite viewpoint of the Apple Steve Jobs, the insides must be beautiful. Yes. But it's actually a lot closer in philosophy than you would think. It is intentionality about it. Yes. Nowhere in either company is there sloppiness. At Ikea, it's, we are going to intentionally make the backside and the insides not beautiful so that it is a higher value to you as a customer.
  Speaker 2
  Yeah, there's so much good stuff in this document. Just to illustrate Ingvar's personality, the fact that he wrote this is, well, here it is. Bear in mind that time is your most important resource. You can do so much in 10 minutes. 10 minutes, once gone, are gone for good. You can never get them back. 10 minutes are not just a sixth of your hourly pay. 10 minutes are a piece of yourself. Divide your life into 10-minute units and sacrifice as few of them as possible in meaningless activity.
  Speaker 1
  I'm so glad that you brought this up. I wasn't going to put this in the episode, but I totally highlighted that reading it. And I was like, wow, I need to think about that in my life.
  Speaker 2
  Totally. And there's so many times when we're like 10 minutes away from a call that you and I are jumping on or 10 minutes away from recording an episode. And I'm like, I'm amazed in the amount I could get done in those 10 minutes when I really was forced to. And it's such a good point. Like if you actually force yourself, hey, just go focus and get 10 minutes of work done. You can be astonishingly productive in 10 minutes. Totally.
  Speaker 1
  I hadn't thought about this, but maybe Ikea and Apple are more spiritually aligned than I even realized. Ikea and Apple are very similar in a way that I will get to later. Ooh, okay. I love it. Okay. And then another similarity analogy, the last testament, number nine, is just so early Jeff Bezos shareholder letter-like that we can't not read it. The title of the testament is, most things still remain to be done. A glorious future! So he writes, the feeling of having finished something is an effective sleeping pill. A person who retires feeling that he has done his bit will quickly wither away. A company which feels that it has reached its goal will quickly stagnate and lose its vitality. Happiness is not reaching your goal. Happiness is being on the way. It is our wonderful fate to be just at the beginning in all areas. We will move ahead only by constantly asking ourselves how what we are doing today can be done better tomorrow. The positive joy of discovery must be our inspiration in the future too.
  Speaker 2
  Oh, I share this affliction A hundred percent, me too. I feel for Ingvar that this is his, like, view on life because anytime anything awesome happens, I'm, like, immediately on to the next thing and unwilling to acknowledge. Like, it doesn't give me happiness that something great happened. What gives me happiness is working toward the next great thing. If we ever just decided, all right, we made all the good episodes, we're done, I'd be miserable.
  Speaker 1
  I was going to laugh. I'd be like, this is the story of Acquired, too. It's so funny. But more on the personal life advice from this, too. Engvar, I think, is living proof of this. I mean, the man lives to be 91. He clearly didn't think he was going to live to be anywhere near that age. And the stories we heard of him visiting stores, being super engaged in board meetings, making decisions, making product decisions up until the last weeks of his life at 91 years old.

    - **Note:** Life is a process not a thing a journey. Divide life into 10 minute intervals and monetize those. Yiu can do so much in 10 minutes
