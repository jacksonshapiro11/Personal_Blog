### Highlights

- I know I promised you my own personal method for finding these kinds of interesting employees in a company, so here it is…
  I like LinkedIn.
  When I’m deconstructing a company, I start by reading a few interviews with the founders to plot the growth over time, along with any other major milestones.
  I chart it so I can see any major turning points. For example…

  Then, I search LinkedIn for everyone who’s worked at a place, or was hired around major turning points in a company, and manually plot their…
  • Name
  • Title
  • Department (Editorial, Sales, Operations, etc.)
  • Start/End Dates
  …in a spreadsheet.
  **There’s probably a way to do this automatically with robots or VAs or something, but I do it manually because I find it gives me a much better feel for each person’s actual relationship with a company.**
  For example, on LinkedIn, someone may say they were CMO of a company for just three months, and if you take that data at face value, you may think something very bad must have happened for a company to hire and lose such an important role in so short a time.
  But when you look closer, you see that this person was a sophomore in college at the time, that the company was just a month old, and that actually, it wasn’t so much an executive hire as it was kids trying to get something off the ground.
  That sort of thing happens a lot when you study startups, and that’s why I do it manually.
  At any rate, if you do this, what you’re left with is a map that shows how a company grew over time – where their hiring priorities were, and by extension, the major challenges or opportunities they were facing at any given point, as well as the people who played pivotal roles in their success.
  It’s not perfect. Some people don’t keep their LinkedIn up to date. But it’s directionally accurate, and enough to give you the kind of look into a company you won’t typically find on TechCrunch.
  Once you have that, there are two things you can do:
  • **Sleuthing:** I plug names of lesser-known key employees into Google and Spotify to see if they’ve talked about their work publicly at all – often, they have.
  • **Consulting:** A lot of people are happy to give you an hour of their time after they leave a company, and for $100 or so, you can learn things the original employer paid thousands to understand.
  You don’t need many. In fact, most the time, all it takes is one name, and from there, you can find your way to the rest.
  That’s the beauty of focusing on people – they have such rich context. A ten-minute chat can save you hours of research.
  And so I’ll leave you with one more little tip I got from Zach when we worked together – something small that’s had a big impact on my work.
  When finishing an interview, one of the last questions he always asked was, “Who else do you think I should talk to about this?”
  It’s small. But you wouldn’t believe what comes from that. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq1eg26dkpye1vtf0zebv3zc))
    - **Note:** The best and most accessible advantage is an information advantage and the way to cultivate that is doing something others don't or wont do.
