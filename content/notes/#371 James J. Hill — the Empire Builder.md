### Highlights

- Learning Transcends Adversity
  Summary:
  Experiencing poverty and physical adversity shaped a lifelong love for learning and reading.
  James J. Hill's childhood hardships, including a near-fatal accident that left him blind in one eye, did not deter him from cultivating a voracious reading habit. Despite limited formal education, he became proficient in reading, writing, and arithmetic, demonstrating that passion for knowledge can overcome significant challenges.
  His strong desire to learn, especially about history and biography, illustrates the importance of resilience and self-education in personal development.

  It's said that family led a frontier existence. Later in life, James talks about knowing what it was like to be poor and that his father was not very prosperous. One of his most vivid childhood memories is the fact that he would lay awake at night staring at the moonlight that would beam through the holes in their roof. And that was back when he had two good eyes. When he was nine years old, he was out hunting with a bow and arrow. The bow that he had handmade had snapped and the arrow flies backwards, hitting his right eye and prying it out of its socket. They were able to reattach the eye, but he was permanently blind out of that eye. And even with one eye, he read everything all the time. There's a handful of traits that James J. Hill has, even when he's young, that he carries with him throughout his entire life. One is this voracious reading habit. That left eye proved to be very strong and would serve him faithfully through a long lifetime of intensely close reading and reckoning. Hill would often tell other people about the inadequacies of his education. He says he never went to school a day after he was 14, but he could read, write, and reckon. And more importantly, he loved to learn. And this won't surprise you, but one of the subject matters he loved was history and biography. ([Time 0:04:55](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6ec496fe-a72f-4890-805a-68a13aa059fd))
    - **Note:** Voracious reader who love to learn despite losing an eye at eight. Love Napoleon and believed in the great man, theory of history. His dad dies when he’s 14 and he has to go to work. He has a voracious workload works every hour of the week. Left Canada for the US. The biggest trait is the ability to save money. Very charismatic and high energy. He was a natural born promoter. He does work for wholesale grocers, and this gives him insight on how to handle railroads later. Rockerfeller sees the discounts and favorable pricing grocers got and applied this to the railroads and created his competitive advantage allowed him to control costs. Without these favorable rates the business couldn’t have worked and he learned it young in another industry. He wants to hire entrepreneurs not employees
- Streamline for Success
  Summary:
  James J. Hill's innovative approach involved building a two-story warehouse that streamlined the transfer of goods from riverboats to trains by aligning the levels to eliminate unnecessary steps.
  His philosophy emphasizes simplicity, as he consistently worked to reduce complexity and costs in operations. The principle that 'genius has the fewest moving parts' reflects Hill's clear thinking and focus on perfecting essential details, showcasing that effective solutions require both observation and reduction of excess in processes.

  That is the railroad he's eventually going to buy out of bankruptcy many years in the future. Okay. So his company, this time, they get hired to transfer goods from the riverboats and load them on the trains. And so his first innovation was, Hey, I'm just going to build a two-story warehouse on the riverbank. The first floor is going to be level with the dock. The second story was level with the railroad, making it much easier to transfer from boat to railroad and eliminated the need to unload and reload onto horses. I would say from reading a lot about him and then spending four hours watching the documentary too, he loved, James J. Hill loved eliminating steps. Eliminating that one step drastically reduced the cost of transfer. There's a maxim that I have about this that I think about all the time. It says, genius has the fewest moving parts. This will be a reoccurring theme for everything that Hill does. If you study what he does, he's an unbelievably clear thinker. He limits the number of details and then he makes every detail perfect. And so his first business is founded on an observation that, hey, I could do that a better way. ([Time 0:15:30](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1fa75718-5cca-4ca9-a40b-aa909ba13c6d))
    - **Note:** He was the only railroad that did not go out of business. He was relentlessly efficient and always control his cost. He always saw a better way. He has uncompromising standards. He’s very high agency. He’s very pragmatic and will join with enemies when it suits him. He’s worried about a war and he goes to the Canadian government to settle it so it doesn’t fuck his business. Competitive advantage was coming from the world of transportation versus other railroad people coming from finance. Understood the industry must better. He’s rich and has a great life but decides go go all in to the railroads. He’s obsessed He finds an opportunity hide in plain sight, but he does all the work even learning about the finances of the Dutch holding company who has the railroad. Everyone Thought this was a shitty line that would never work, but James did all of the work to show it would Work. He did all the work.
- Demand Excellence or Be Left Behind
  Summary:
  Hill exemplified the principle of uncompromising standards in leadership by removing a partner who did not meet his expectations.
  His dedication to the railroad project pushed him to take on management tasks himself, showcasing his exceptional skills in leadership and operational control. Hill's commitment involved relentless work hours, balancing strategic oversight with meticulous attention to detail, often at the cost of his personal life.
  This relentless drive underscores the importance of leadership capability and personal sacrifice in achieving ambitious goals.

  So originally Hill and the four associates, that's what they're called, had another guy named Farley in charge of the actual construction of the railroad. And like Hill did in the past, even if you're his partner, if he did not think you were good enough, he would cash you aside. He is going to maintain his uncompromising standards. And keep in mind, he has all of his money into this thing. If this thing fails, he'll lose everything. And so Hill is going to cast aside Farley. Farley is going to be referenced here as the old man. And this is the way the biography describes it. Impetuous and impatient, Hill crowd the old man remorsiously and began taking on more of the tasks of the management himself, eventually removing Farley completely. Hill now entered one of the most dynamic phases of his life. For the first time engaging in the work of railroad construction, he would prove remarkably good at it, demonstrating a rare ability to muster and command men and materials and to control Both a broad strategy and a myriad of details. Hill worked and worried by day and night. He would be at his St. Paul office until after midnight, and then in the field, driving himself to the limit and seeing little of his family. ([Time 0:29:27](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b291c276-43b5-4cc3-b069-bb6279da5a53))
    - **Note:** Hill finds what he’s best at at 40 despite being very successful in other things. Even if it’s a partner, if he think someone isn’t up to standards, he gets rid of them and takes the job himself. Stay close to where the money is spent. He made the building twice as efficient. Inefficiency offends bill. He builds with a philosophy of most efficient lowest lines least curvature. Imports more expensive material but no one else is because he wants to make it built to last and long-term this is the right decision. He’s always seeing from the front. He appreciates people who has dirt under his fingernails. This helped him outcompete his competitors who were in office buildings in NYC. He held those people in contempt
- Build with Purpose, Not for Speed
  Summary:
  Building with a focus on long-term vision and uncompromising quality yields better results than rapid, cost-ignorant expansion.
  While some leaders may rush their projects for immediate gains, such an approach can lead to significant setbacks, as demonstrated by the necessity of rebuilding poorly constructed lines. Successful initiatives involve investing in superior materials and technology, managing workforces effectively, and maintaining capacity through engagement and personal recognition of workers, which fosters a dedicated team.
  The contrast between careful planning and hasty execution underscores the importance of sustainable construction practices.

  While Hill was building carefully and checking his costs minutely, Villard built in ignorance of costs. So Villard is going to drive his line into bankruptcy and JP Morgan's actually going to get control of this. But that happens in the future. So it says Villard built in ignorance of cost. Like other transcontinental plungers and speculators, Villard did in fact build rapidly and poorly. Much of his line would later have to be torn up and rebuilt. He had rushed so he could get massive land grants. Amid mounting deficits, Villard would then be forced to resign in 1884. So I want to go back to Hill in his early days, building his first line. These are traits, the idea of building for the long term, uncompromising standards, using the best materials, investing technology. These are things that Hill's going to do for the next, for the remaining 37 years of his life. But at this point, he's building his first line. He says, keeping work crews in the fields and keeping them working at capacity proved especially difficult. Hill cajoled and coerced his workers. He learned many of the men's names and would walk around along the track, calling out to them. ([Time 0:36:07](https://share.snipd.com/snip/95c9b8c7-b314-4afd-a56c-7edc67dc1fd3))
    - **Note:** Build long-term learns all the men’s names. The government financed Railroads by the mile, so there is an incentive to make it less efficient, which is competitors, but he never did. He manages the rail to profitability right away and realizes that this is his life’s work. Find what you’re good at and do it forever. He had such a deep understanding of the railroad better than anyone else in the world much like Bernard aurnad or Steve Jobs. They built slowly creating profitable lines before they scaled. Competitors built all at once and this is why they all went bankrupt. Start small and scale. He was an intense micromanager. He cannot delegate and live with that. His genius was a photographic manager. He never had fun, but he was always reading. He was difficult to work for and with though. He was a demanding raging autocratic. Worked forever to be the best.
- Monopoly as a Catalyst for Economic Growth
  Summary:
  Monopolies can create downward pressure on prices, benefiting consumers despite potential criticisms.
  Historical figures like Hill illustrate the extreme personalities that can emerge in business disputes, exemplified by Hill's threats to political leaders opposing him. The belief that monopolistic practices can foster connections between people and lands suggests that such strategies could drive economic growth and the development of population centers through mutual interdependence.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And he will continue to make the case that the result of his monopoly is the fact that it helps him push the prices down, not up. And Hill was such an important figure in this time of American business history that he pops up in all kinds of books. So there's this book I read a long time ago called The Hour of Fate, and it talks about the war and temporary partnership between Teddy Roosevelt and J.P. Morgan. And Teddy Roosevelt is the one that's pressuring to break up these monopolies and these trusts. And to give you an idea of how extreme a personality that Hill was, says Hill threatened the president and the attorney general that if they do fight, they will have their hands full and They will wish they had never been born before they get through with me. So definitely an extreme person, if you're willing to say that to the president, attorney general. Let's get back to this point, though. His point is that his product is going to connect people and lands and that this connection is going to promote economic growth and really develop and create population centers. So long term, this is a good strategy to have this mutual interdependence to make sure that they thrive and they develop the land as much as possible. ([Time 0:47:16](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ccf49b95-f714-4758-82a9-e121dc8479da))
    - **Note:** He’s always developing land and made businesses that thrive. He wanted the best workers and would bring people over from Europe because he thought they were great great sometimes whole churches at a time. He was relentlessly, controlling his cost, and keeping prices low price customer. He was so efficient none of his competition could compete at his level. He saw the people who lived on the railroad as partners and wanted prosperity for them because it was good incentives for him because they use it more. He’s constabtly changing and adapting. He realizes he has to build a transcontinental railroad and reached 12 volumes to find one possible route that would work cheapest. He always admires excellence
- In Adversity, True Talent Emerges
  Summary:
  True talent often shines brightest amidst adversity, as illustrated by the challenges faced during the construction of the Great Northern Railway.
  James J. Hill endured countless struggles, from managing a railroad under difficult conditions to dealing with a slow pace of construction and labor shortages. His respect for competency is evident in his response to his civil engineer, John F. Stevens, who defied his orders and continued construction despite Hill's concerns about a necessary 13-degree curve.
  Upon recognizing Stevens' wisdom, Hill not only acknowledged him but raised his salary significantly, demonstrating how honoring true excellence can lead to success.
  Hill approached his business as a living organism, always seeking to adapt and enhance its efficiency.
  His commitment to continuous improvement and focus on core operations, prioritizing freight over frills, exemplifies his passion for the industry. Despite his remarkable contributions, Hill's dual personality displayed extreme traits—his intelligence and work ethic balanced by a fierce temper and manipulative behaviors. The legacy he left behind, cemented in history as the Empire Builder, is a testament to the profound impact one determined individual can have on the economy and social order, proving that adversity can catalyze exceptional talent and enduring influence.

  This decision to build all the way to the Pacific is going to lead to the hardest work of Hill's life. It is just struggle after struggle after struggle. This paragraph just describes some of the problems he had to solve. Trying to manage a railroad while building it west, Hill worked night and day agonizing over expenses and the slow pace of construction. Workers in these remote mountains proved hard to get and to keep. They often had to labor on steep slopes with hand tools and to move dirt in hand carts and terrain where even horses proved difficult to use. The pace of building fell to merely a few miles per week, and Hill fretted as he saw his hope of completion fading away. And yet, even in the most difficult time of his life, you see one of his traits that's most pronounced throughout his life is that he admires true excellence, true talent. I think a part of human nature is that competency is always respected. So keep in mind, his manager on the site is the civil engineer, John F. Stevens. Okay. Stevens sends a report to Hill and he says, Hey, we have to do a 13 degree curve. And he'll look through the report. He's like, this is ridiculous. Remember, he always wants the straightest route possible. So he tells Stevens, Hey, stop all construction until I get out there. And so Hill travels out to this remote part where he realizes, once he gets there, realizes that Stevens did not obey his orders and he kept construction going. So Hill then tells Stevens, show me this curve. Stevens shows it to him and Hill realizes that Stevens was right. It had to be a 13 degree curve. There was no other option. Hill also realized that Stevens was right to defy his direct order to stop construction. And so Hill immediately raises Stevens' salary by 50%. Stevens was the one that made it possible for James J. Hill to reach the goal he had for the Great Northern Railway, which was to get it all the way to the Pacific. And once he reached the Pacific, he didn't stop there. There's a great description of the way Hill thought about this. I think it's a great idea to think of your business as a living organism, something that's always adapting and improving. And he said to Hill, the railroad trunk lines and their spreading branches formed a living, vital organism, which constantly needed to be replenished. Hill's life passion lay in straightening curves, lowering grades, laying high-grade steel rails, raising tonnages hauled by ever-larger cars and engines, and lowering rates and Extending over ever-longer distances. He cared most about freight, never frills. There's a line in the biography of the founder of IKEA that you and I talked about last week that I think could also be a description of Hill. It said, The day he is free of IKEA, life for him will no longer be worth living. He loves it, always wants to lie as close as possible to it, and never tires of improving it. James J. Hill never stops improving his railroad and works on it until he dies. And I think this is the perfect place to close. Like most other robber barons and captains of industry, and like dynamic individuals of any generation, James J. Hill displayed a dualism. His positive traits were quite remarkable. A quick intelligence and a power of analysis, an incredible power of will and personality, and an unparalleled work ethic and commitment. His negative attributes were mirror images of the positive, an extreme temper that sometimes exploded into rage, a willfulness that could turn into outright realness. And I think this is the perfect place to close. A cold manipulativeness that he used on adversaries, and such a preoccupation with the purpose at hand that he sometimes lost sight of the broader perspective. What does one conclude in the final analysis about this remarkable man? Surely the Northwest will never again witness an individual with such sweeping power simply because the unique opportunity provided by an opening frontier and a transportation Monopoly will never again appear. It is entirely appropriate that the passenger train from Chicago to Seattle is called the Empire Builder in his memory, for his hand reached every aspect of building the regional economy And social order, from transportation to agriculture, mining, lumbering, maritime trade, and town and city building. His larger-than stature is well attested by the persistence, nearly 80 years after his death, of his memory and legend. The life of James J. Hill certainly demonstrates the impact one willful individual can have on the course of history. As Hill said, I've made my mark on the surface of the earth and they can't wipe it out. ([Time 0:53:35](https://share.snipd.com/snip/75c48ca1-ab6d-4cd0-a68b-159bd06fb1d9))
    - **Note:** Kid Myers excellence and when someone defies him, but he realizes he was right instead of firing him, he promotes him and gives him a raise. Sees the railroad as an organism. He did what he loved until he died. He was a strong example of the duality of man.
