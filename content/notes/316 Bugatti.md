  And so it says nothing like a Ferrari had ever graced American roads. They were cars built by Italian artisans. Every detail down to the steering wheel handcrafted using some of the same methods used to make Roman suits of armor and the royal carriages of the ancient cars. And so this idea of cutting against the bias to use the term that Balenciaga used last week, you have the trends within your industry that everybody else is adopting and copying. Bugatti was like Balenciaga. Bugatti was like Ferrari. He would constantly cut against the bias. So it says he was too strong to change to new methods as other car manufacturers resigned themselves to doing. So they're talking about changing from this like an artisan handmade factory to mass production. Bugatti had no interest in that at all. And he taught all of his employees to adopt this mindset as well. By his training, Bugatti raised his workmen to the level of artisans and craftsmen. These two words evoke his own personality. He was an artist and a craftsman. He always insisted that his engineers and technicians should never ignore the promptings of their intuition. I was a young engineer at the time and I fell under the spell of his charm and his singleness of purpose. ([Time 0:07:31](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9d6f5708-7e9f-458f-b09e-f18b134fa0e7))
    - **Note:** Bugatti was counter positioned making his cars with artisans and craftsmen when the rest of the industry was adopting the conveyor belt and mass production. Bugattis dad said he could do anything as long as it was not average. Needed to output high quality work. He realized he had a nack for building machines abs he was in the right place and time for the automobile revolution. Came from
      A family of artists. Bugatti was passion personified he loved racing because it proved the specs of his car in the metal and competition. He would sketch a design out on paper in theory done then would spend years financing and building it much like Steve Jobs or Edwin lande who could conceive things easily but getting and organization behind it took time. He could do any job in the factory better than any worker this same anecdote is in the James Cameron and Chris Nolan biographies and he did this at 16. Bugatti had insane levels of self confidence believing his car the first one he built would win the race he entered it in and it did. This lead to his getting a contract from a German manufacturer to make his car. He was happy because he was doing work that felt like play.

  Faster progress. This is wild. Faster progress would be made in all fields if conceit did not cause us to forget or disdain the work done by others before us. There is a tendency to believe that nothing worthy of note has been done in the past. And this has an unfortunate bearing on our judgment. Thus the present trend toward mediocrity. The improvements I have made to mechanical constructions have resulted from such habits of observation. And so he talks about that starts in your mind first. I often think that one should not put pencil to paper before having visualized what one wants to do from all angles. Over the years and after much experience drawing quite novel and complicated things in pocketbooks, I have come to work by a series of mental images. And the drawing board enables me to give effect to those images. A technician who cannot put down his ideas on paper is at a great disadvantage. To sum this up, the powers of observation and a great facility with the pencil are the two attributes that matter the most. And so before he sets up Bugatti as like his own independent company, he is going to design cars for other car manufacturers and then he gets paid per car manufactured on like a royalty basis. And so he does this two or three times, but the way he sets this up, it really tells you like how important independence, like maintaining his independence was. Before I get there though, this is what finding your life's work sounds like. I was hypnotized, drawn more and more to the mechanics of motors. These exciting problems had me completely under their sway. And so began for me, the hard uphill task, the thankless labor of constructing and destroying and beginning again without a break or rest. And for days, months, years even, until success finally rewarded all my efforts. And so he has a little team, there's like three people in the workshop putting together the car, three people in like the design shop putting it together. And they don't have enough money to manufacture it themselves, so he does another deal with this company called Dootz. This is Dootz gas engine. It's also in Germany. So they're going to manufacture the car, but they also make Bugatti the manager of the production department. In his contract though, he makes sure that he's always retaining his independence. And so this is what he says, it was the first time that I had agreed to take an appointment with a firm, meaning an actual day job. Whilst being compensated by the royalties I received on the production of my car under their license, I had retained, this is the important part, I had retained the right to work independently on any other project in which I might be interested. He did not want to be relegated to the servitude of employee. He said so much himself, he had felt fettered by his appointment in the service of others. And so that clause was the most important clause in the entire contract because what he's doing is in his spare time. He is going to build the very first Bugatti. So Bugatti decided to build it himself in his spare time. He worked patiently for many months, gradually assembling it in the cellar of the house where he was living. When it was complete, he gave it a name which would later become renowned, per saying. It means thoroughbred animal and French. And so this is the beginning of the business, this is the beginning of him building his own world within the world. This is the birth of Molshem, where the Bugatti factory is till to this day. So he goes to a banker with his plans, they give him the funding to start his business, and this is his daughter describing this point in their life. At Christmas, we all moved into the new house where we were to live for the next 30 years. So Bugatti's around 30 years old at the time and a description of the early days of his company really tells you a lot about what was important to him. He says his cars were hand built, each an expression of the creator's personality. He retained his independent outlook, his freedom to invent, and his urge for perfection down to the smallest details. He took little notice of trends among rival car manufacturers. That reminded me of last week when Balenciaga was like this with other fashion designers. And Bugatti paid no more attention to the presumed taste of the public. That sounds like Steve Jobs. Essentially what they're saying there is he relied on his own taste. He built the product that he wanted to use. And you're going to see another similarity with Balenciaga. I think last week it said like Dior, Christian Dior made dresses for the rich, and Balenciaga made dresses for the wealthy. Right from the very beginning, Bugatti with his actions is essentially saying, hey, I make expensive shit. I only want to make high quality products and I'm aiming for the top. And he did this from day one. Bugatti made no attempt to compete with the low price popular models already on the market. The price of the Bugatti was higher than any other car of equal horsepower. The reason is that this new production stands in a class by itself. And so they started out making like five, ten cars a year.

    - **Note:** Studied da Vinci and loved the power of his observation and he made that a key tenant in his life. He was able to envision things in his mind then translate them to paper. He found his life’s work he was hypnotized working without resting. Bugatti got a job making cars but wrote into his contract the ability to work on the side. In his free time he designed and financed the first Bugatti. He didn’t like working for others. He built his car independently minded not following trends but focusing on the beauty and power he loved in cars. He relied on his own taste not others. Bugatti after only 2 years knew more about cars than any of his competitors because he was obsessed. He only sold a few very high end cars to the very rich with word of mouth marketing. He kept open the the telephone line to his subconscious so he had strong diffusive learning.
- Bugatti: The Universal Mechanical Genius
  Key takeaways:
  - The book details the perilous journey of Bugatti during World War II.
  - Bugatti hid his racing car engines in the grounds of his estate and was able to recover them later.
  - Bugatti's mechanical genius was not limited to cars but extended to other vehicles as well.
  - Bugatti made airplane engines for the Allies during World War I, including a contract with Americans.
  - Bugatti valued friendships and had several great friendships throughout his life.
  - Roland Garros offered Bugatti all the money in his bank account to help with his difficulties during the war.

  Speaker 1
  And so the book goes into great detail about how like perilous journey is, he ends up getting his family out of Germany, gets them back into Italy. Now this is a crazy thing, he sneaks back into occupied German territory, because he has to hide his engines. Remember this part, because this is going to become really important a few years now. The factory was later taken over by local authorities, but before then, soon after seeing his family safely to Italy, Bugatti returned for a few days, he buried the engines of three racing cars in the grounds of his estate. These engines, which were his latest constructions, were never detected, and he was able to recover them at the end of the war. And so imagine you're in his shoes, you have, I think, three kids at the time, a wife, a successful business, essentially his business is going to be paused for five or six years, he's eventually going to go back and reclaim it, he's going to lose it again in World War II, which we'll get to. But what was he doing during World War I? He's not building cars anymore, and so we see for the first time that his mechanical genius is universal, and he does this for his whole life, like he'll make cars, he'll make boats, he'll make airplane engines, he'll make rail cars. This guy's a legit genius, so he starts designing during World War I, he's making airplane engines for the Allies, and specifically for the Americans, I just want to pull out one part because it made me laugh. This American company, I think this is 1916, maybe, they're on there. He's making airplane engines for him, and says Bugatti received a nice, fat check, less than a week after his first contract with the Americans, and not being used to such promptness on the part of official departments, he went to the bank with the check and had to ask if it was valid. And so this is the first time that the book mentions, but I need to bring this to your attention because it's, I'm obsessed with Bugatti, the fact that the way he built his life, the way he built his business, everything he did, I find him fascinating. But this is something that also is extremely important, this idea that friends greatly enhance the magnificent, mysterious odyssey that we call life. And Bugatti was a good friend, he prioritized it, I thought this was very fascinating, an accountable God's life would not be complete without mention of his friendships. Work was not everything to him, he opened up when in the company of a few friends, he was fortunate enough to enjoy several great friendships during the course of his life. And one of these was Roland Garros, who I'd mentioned the famous French aviator, the one that would land in the meadow at Bugatti's setup, right? Listen to how deep their friendship was, this is incredible. It's even more incredible in the fact that there is war raging all around them, right? These are Europeans in 1915. Garros offered Bugatti all the money in his bank account, about 200,000 francs, it was his whole fortune. You're helping the war effort, Garros said, just as I am, but I know of your difficulties, you have a wife and three children, I'm a bachelor and I might get killed at the front any day. Garros has sent Bugatti a picture of them together, says, to Etorre Bugatti, the incomparable artist, who alone knows how to give life to steal, in admiration and friendship, sign Roland Garros.

    - **Note:** Bugatti had his business disrupted by 2 world wars both times acting quickly to get out of danger. He in war time built engines for the Allies he loved machinery. He also deeply values friendships and relationships. Roland garros who was a deep friend was fighting in airplanes at the front and gave Bugatti his entire fortune in case he were to die in war which he did. He counter positioned his ideas and had to rebuild his company from scratch afyer the war. He built a car for Le Mans using a pre war engine he had buried then dug up after the war. When everyone thought heavy was the key he went light and won Le Mans by 20 minutes. He trusted his intuition but it couldn’t be tested. He focused on winning on the race track as marketing and he sold his race cars. His independent mindedness did manifest as suborness. He only hired the best workers and built his factory as a manifestation of what he believed. It was more than a house but a family environment. The workshop was the embodiment of the founder.
- The Personality of Bugatti: A Remarkable Example of an Unusual Founder
  Key takeaways:
  - The cleanliness of the workshops and doors was maintained by a dedicated employee.
  - Bugatti insisted on strict organization and cleanliness.
  - Bugatti's personality and attention to detail were evident in every aspect of his work.
  - Bugatti had a unique style and manner.
  - He was observant and had a gift for conversation.
  - Bugatti was generous and enthusiastic, with a love for beauty.

  Speaker 1
  The explanation of the shining cleanliness of all the doors in the various workshops was quite simple. An employee, one employee, did nothing else but keep the paths and the workshops floors clean and the door plates from which all oily marks left by mechanics were wiped away immediately when they were made. That is also something that pops up over and over again in the book, that he insisted on everything being organized and clean 24-7 to the point where somebody's job was to make sure the rocks were off the pathway. And if there was a smidge of oil on a door as a mechanic left, that had to be wiped away immediately. And so before moving on, I want to go back to this one line. The personality of its founder continued to show in even the smallest details and unexpected ways. The best way to think about this is a line that I read in one of the 10 or 15 books that I've read on Steve Jobs. This is Steve made and remade Apple in his own image. Apple is Steve Jobs with 10,000 lives. You could say the same thing about Bugatti in another example of his very unusual personality. Bugatti once received a bill for electricity, accompanied by a letter written in terms which he considered to be discretious. He said as much to the manager, adding, Common see me in a year's time. I shall have something interesting to show you. A year later, he had built his own electricity generating plant. There was nothing at motion which did not bear the mark of one man, his taste, his wishes, and even his moods. This is one of my favorite parts of the book because it just goes on and on, page after page, and I finally just wrote. I just wrote this note to myself. All of this is excellent. I love everything about Bugatti. He was always well dressed and wore his clothes with a quiet elegance, whether at the factory or in town. He had a style and manner all of his own. He was an optimist. He had a remarkable gift of observation which spiced his conversation. He was genial and generous in every respect, and his egoism only showed if his habits were threatened. He was excitable at times, young and lively in spirit, tackling problems with enthusiasm. He liked beauty in all things. ([Time 0:46:20](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c0295442-c7fc-4a2d-bbb1-abdf4f9fa3e1))
    - **Note:** When electricity was too expensive he built his own plant. He was an elegant man and his company was him with 10k lives. He loved beauty everything was second to that he was nice except when threatened. He was always thinking and was very detail oriented. He didn’t care about keeping up with the status of others internal locus of control. Dyson praised figuring things out for himself understanding the root principle not just accepting what experts thought or taking things at face value. Had to learn for himself and had no technical training scorned not revered experts. Bugatti has to deal with the Great Depression worker unrest the sudden death of his son who was gonna take over then ww2 eventually this crushes him. Just hit after hit eventually becomes too much and he dies.

  Speaker 1
  I am now 86 years old, and in these last years of my life, I can look back and measure the worth of the men I have known in the course of a career full of surprises. Most of my contemporaries were incapable of making an effort beyond what was required of them. I have therefore very vivid recollections of those few who were capable of actions and initiative. In his book, The Revolt of the Masses, Jose Ortega Iga Set wrote these inspired words. This is one of my favorite paragraphs in the entire book. A human life, by its very nature, has to be devoted to something or other, to a glorious or humble enterprise, an illustrious or obscure destiny. This is a strange but inexorable condition of things. Ortega Iga Set must have known Bugatti at the time of writing those lines. The production of cars and moleshine was really just a game to my friend, and his successes came easy to him. He was one of the last car manufacturers able to imagine whole, to assemble in his mind the most varied and complicated mechanical constructions, effortlessly, yet with exactness. In a word, Itori Bugatti was one of the last mechanics truly worthy of the name. A larger volume would be needed in order to give a full and clear account of his influence. After the war, this truly French technician was the victim of regrettable incidents, and his health was there by affected. He passed away in 1947. In 1913, I lost my brother Charles in a car accident for which a third party was entirely to blame. He was only 30, yet he must have found death to be kind. He was at the wheel of a Bugatti. And that is where I'll leave it for the full story I highly, highly, highly recommend. Buying the book if you can, I think there's only a few copies available. I'm so glad this book came into my life. ([Time 0:58:09](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7a4176a8-9303-497f-91a0-264f8bf3ab88))
    - **Note:** A friends eulogy 20 year after Bugatti died.
