  2. Grooming triggers the endorphin system through specific slow stroking actions on the skin, signaling more intense individual relationships as group size increases.
  3. Laughter is three times more efficient, singing creates an 'icebreaker effect' turning strangers into close-knit groups, with people sharing life stories and secrets.
  4. Singing has been effective for groups of up to 200 people with the larger the group, the better the effect.
  5. Activities like singing are crucial for building relationships and human connection might be undervalued in current society. ([Time 0:00:00](https://share.snipd.com/episode-takeaways/c3c79792-58a0-475a-84c0-09a2fac0e6e2))
