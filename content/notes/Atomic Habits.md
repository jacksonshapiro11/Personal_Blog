### Highlights

- Someone’s habits become internalized like brushing your teeth but then performance may slip so you need to stay on top of your progress to make sure your habits are moving you forward. When you start to slip you need to be most careful. When you feel at the top of your game you need to hold yourself most accountable. Sustaining an effort is vital you must create a good process then reflect t and review it constantly. Reflection and review is key to both create new habits and refine old habits. Create integrity report and a value report. To outline your value and hold yourself accountable to those value. Periodic review allows you to establish and review identity. Keep your identity small and flexible don’t see yourself as a soldier but see yourself as someone who commits to something larger than yourself ect. Stiff and inflexible is death pliant and yielding is life.

      You need to periodically review your values and performance and create accountability. Keep your identity small.
- Work at the edge of your abilities so you can remain in flow and you stay focused. Not too easy not too hard. Really successful people show up when they’re bored. Professionals stick to the schedule even when they don’t want to or it’s boring.

    - **Note:** Keep pushing yourself and embrace the suck. Success isn’t about embracing the highs but managing through the lows. Success is a lagging indicator to embracing the suck
- Habits are easier to perform when they’re within your circle of competence and favor your abilities. Genes can be favorable or unfavorable for certain tasks so align your genes to your habits and goals. Find habits that fit you. Use explore vs exploit and power laws to optimize 80 exploit 20 explore. Do what is painful to you but more painful to others. Where do you get greater returns than others. Win by better or by different. Create your own path. Be the best in a specialized category. Find the favorable environment to find the most optimal odds. Understand our nature and well understand our strategy. You need to work hard on what comes easy. Choose what comes naturally

    - **Note:** Choose habits that favor your unique differentiation competing in games where you have an edge work that feels like play. Circle of competence and interest do what you enjoy. Discover through explore exploit.
- The more immediate and tangible a consequence is the more likely it is to influence behavior. Create a contract that outlines and signs into print what you agree and don’t agree to you’re more likely to act on what you want to happen. The contract is a forcing function. Get an accountability partner to make your failures clear and negative.

    - **Note:** Create forcing functions and accountability when you want to form habits to feel tangible success and failure will increase your chances of success. Include identity increase accountability.
      Increase accountability and tighten feedback loops.
- Tracking your habits can help you keep the streak alive can be inherently motivating and instantly rewarding casting votes on who you want to become. When you fail once it’s ok but don’t miss twice in a row. Once you get to 2-3 in a row you’re starting a new trend it’s important just to accept the failure and get back after it to continue building on the macro trend. Doing something not putting up a 0. It’s ok to not have an A+ work out but just showing up yo keep the cycle compounding is more important than anything. Don’t interrupt compounding unnecessarily. We optimize for what we measure but just because we can or can’t measure something it’s not valuable or bad. Goodharts law when the measure becomes the objective the original goal is bastardized.

    - **Note:** Habits are many times about momentum create momentum then ride the wave. Not every day is your A+ performance but showing up and keeping the habit going on a consistent basis is vital to establishing it. Compound your habits avoid putting up a zero and never stop unnecessarily. Half the battle is showing up
- Make it satisfying pleasure hacks our brain to emplore us to repeat good behavior. What is rewarded is repeated what is punished is refrained from. Guy chewing became popular only after good flavoring was added and it was billed as a way to increase mouth and breath freshness. Make it rewarding immediately. We are built for an immediate return environment but much good behavior is based on a long term return environment. With good and bad habits we have misaligned effects where the immediate effect is counter to the long term effect. With smoking you’re immediately relaxed but long term you can die from disease likewise with working out immediately you’re tired and unhappy but long term you’re healthier. Cost of good habits are in the present cost of bad habits are in the future. Delaying gratification is better long term but often we don’t do it because short term it’s worse. You need to make rewards immediate for long term rewards you want or don’t want that in the short term produce the wrong stimulus. So if you want to save money you can deposits % of the money in a fund to buy a fun jacket or short run can cause pain to yourself for smoking. Align habits with your identity with your habits

    - **Note:** Long term and short term rewards are usually counter to what is intended. Often short term good is long term bad and likewise so we need to create stimulus responses to mirror what outcome we want long term.
- A commitment device - lock in your future actions while in the present. Change the task so it’s harder to back out then just do it. Make good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible. Make the good habit automatic. Using a cash register to limit theft not pushing notifications to maintain focus. Automate many things like commitments to 401 ks out of your daily salary automatically. Make it easy Reduce friction prime the environment master the decisive moment optimize the the high leverage moments. Use the 2 minute rule. Automate your habits or invert all these.

    - **Note:** Structure your environment and commitments so it’s easier or harder to do things. Automatic behavior is vital. Make it easy or hard and have a contract with yourself.
- Decisive moments - the key points that define your day when you set a 5 am alarm do you snooze it or go to the gym. Make habits short the 2 minute rule. First 2 minutes are a gateway habit that leads a larger goal. A habit must be established before it can be improved. Standardize before you can optimize. Master the art of showing up. Take the smallest action that confirms who you are. Make something easy then layer on. If you want to lose weight first go to the gym once a week for 15 minutes then twice ect.

    - **Note:** Our day is defined by the decisions made at key leverage points do we snooze the alarm or get up. Likewise a gateway habit is the catalyst to starting something new both good and bad. Small incremental progress.
- Prime your environment to make what you want to do easier. Hide your phone do you use it less. A little bit of friction can have a huge effect on the outcome. Make what is easy what you want and the inversion as well. Humans are lazy.

- Motion vs action rather do something than say you’ll do something. People who took 100 photographs over a semester produced better work than people who were told to create 1 good picture. Going through the steps and putting in the work trains the brain. Go fast fail quickly rather than think of what to do. Good is the enemy of great just try to be good over many tries and you’ll get closer to greatness than any moonshots. It’s not about days spent doing something but reps

    - **Note:** Getting more reps and Increasing the learning rate is vital to learning. Push through the anxiety and just get going. You need to throw shit at the wall and see how it sticks.
- Desire is where you are now vs where you want to be in the future. You need to frame your mindset correctly. A person in a wheelchair can be bound to it or enabled by it. Thinking they have to have it or without it they would be bed ridden. Having the right mindset can completely change a situation and reframe a desire. Creating a ritual to produce a behavior like a pregame ritual can be vital to success or triggering a behavior.

    - **Note:** Desire is a relative state and your current situation could be seen in a positive and negative light so the mindset is vital. Creating rituals can prime feelings and success
- We often look at our culture to know what to desire. We want to belong we immate 3 groups the close the many and the powerful. Join a culture where the prevalent behavior is your desired behavior. When we are unsure of what to do we default to the group even it’s wrong. We’d rather be wrong with the group then right alone
- Your brain can make the idea of wanting something and liking something equivalent. Where a gambler gets dopamine when he places the bet not when he wins it. We desire things often more than we actually like that thing. Group things you want to do with things you need to do. So if you want to check Facebook but need to read the news check Facebook after you read an article so you associate the thing with a more attractive outcome.

    - **Note:** Create a strong associative memory by grouping what you want to do with what you need to do. Create halo effect and positive association to lower the barriers to doing things and actually make you crave it make you want to want to do something
- Structuring your environment well is vital and stacking habits so when you do one you do the other leads to more success than just saying you’ll do something. 90% of heroine users in Vietnam quit when they went home because of the drastic environment change less stress and availability while drug users who go to rehab go back to their environment and thus 90% go back to using. Don’t trust will power most strong willed people just have well designed environments so create places to read and sleep and eat ect. Habit stacking going to the gym and listening to an audio book good habit stack. But you need to intensity matching it. Easier to avoid temptation than resist it self control is a short term strategy. Best way to create habits is to schedule them.

    - **Note:** Structure your environment to avoid temptation rather than rely on self control. Habit stacking and associations.
- Habits are often invisible so becoming aware of your habits is vital. Point and call out your habits to make yourself aware of the situation. Environment shapes behavior - behavior is how a person acts in their environment so if yiu make your environment more conducive to a behavior it is more likely to happen. Making plans for an action make it more likely to happen if you say you’re going to the gym today bs you’re setting an alarm for 6 am and going to the gym right after until 730 you’re more likely to do it

- Create habits using the 4 laws cue - make it obvious/invisible craving - make it attractive/ unattractive response - make it easy/ hard reward - make it satisfying/unsatisfactory to break habits invert the laws

- Habits are reliable solutions to problems in our environment. Mental short cuts learned from experience. Habits don’t restrict freedom they create it. Need to make the fundamentals of life and master them you’re able to take the next step in life and tackle more complex problems. Habits allow you to do more in the future. Building a habit cue craving response and reward. Charles duhig wrote a good book on habits. Cue triggers your brain to initiate a behavior that will produce a reward. A craving is not what you want but the underlying desired state. You don’t want a cigarette you want the relief it provides. Craving a change which is your reason to act. Cues are meaningless unless it’s linked to a desire that produces a craving and the response is the actual act. The response can only be acted upon if you want to and are able to. The response is about obtaining the reward. The reward is the end state. Cue is noticing craving is wanting response is about obtaining the reward. Rewards satisfy us and teach us. Rewards make sure the reward is worth it do you do it again. This is the habit loop

    - **Note:** Habits are mental short cuts that create mental capacity to expand thought predicated on cue craving response and reward
      Cue triggers the craving isn’t for a thing but a deeper feeling. You want a cig to relax. The response is actioning the desire and the reward is the ulitmate desire
- You can change at 3 levels outcomes actions or identity. True change comes at the identity level. True behavior change only comes in the self. You can’t change unless you see yourself differently. Every action you take is a vote on who you want to be. Eventually your identity will become your habits. Figure out what identity you need to realize your goals and start manifesting that identity. Habits aren’t about doing something but becoming someone. You need to edit your beliefs and update/ expand your identity. Habits matter because they can change your beliefs about yourself.

    - **Note:** You can change at different levels of emergence, but really change only comes when you dig deep and change who you are. You are what you continually do and you will eventually become your habits. Habits aren't about doing something but becoming someone. Charlie munger idea learning is behavior change.

- Habits are the compound internet of self improvement 1% daily increase creates a big change over time and changes happen in the our years when you cross a critical threshold. Atomic habits are small inputs into your system. You call to the level of your system. Habits can compound positively or negatively.

- Habits routine or behavior performed regularly often automatically. The quality of our lives is based on the quality of our habits James went from playing 11 innings of varsity baseball to a stand out player in college and best male athlete at Denison. The habits he formed around working out and sleep didn’t make him an elite baseball player but it did make him realize his potential. Benefits of compounding are only seen in the out years. Bamboo grows for 5 years before growing 90 feet in the final 3 months. Success is lagging indicator if habits. You need to build systems not set goals. You don’t rise to the level of your goals you fall to the levels of your system.
