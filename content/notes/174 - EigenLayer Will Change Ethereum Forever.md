### Highlights

- The Evolutionary Advantage of Humans and the Study of Peer-to-Peer Systems
  Summary:
  The two problems we used to always think about from a theoretical viewpoint is the maximal throughput of these systems, peer-to-peer systems. And I'm like, I have memories of doing this before and that didn't end up well. So I don't want to do this. But it took me like three to six months of thinking about the underpinnings of what this could be. The tipping point was realizing how it fit with one of my core principles.

  And the two problems we used to always think about from a theoretical viewpoint is what is the maximal throughput of these systems, peer-to-peer systems, and what is the minimal latency, right? Like, you know, whenever you see a wireless advertisement, they're like, oh, one Gbps and like 20 millisecond latency. This is the kind of thing that you have to obsess about if you want to design those systems. And he's like, oh, this system's the worst in throughput and the worst in latency. But it has some other like amazing properties. So can do you want to come research this? And I'm like, I have memories of doing this before and that didn't end up well. So I don't want to do this. I came to genomics because that's something that I think is really useful to all of us. But it took me like three to six months of like thinking about the underpinnings of what this could be, why actually I wanted to study peer-to-peer, all of these things. But really, like the tipping point for me was, you know, realizing how it fit with one of my core principles. And this actually comes from Yuval Noah Harari from his book, Sapiens, where he mentions that the evolutionary advantage of humans is that we cooperate flexibly in large numbers, right? Like it's not that we're intelligent, it's not that we're anything else. It's the fact that we cooperate flexibly in large numbers. So if this is the evolutionary advantage of humans, anything that boosts this ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers is a kind of like a civilizational upgrade.

    - **Note:** The super power of humans is we coordinate flexibly in large numbers.
- The Emergence of Ethereum's Block Space Economy and Eigenlayer's Marketplace for Raw Decentralized Trust
  Summary:
  Eigenlayer is a marketplace for raw decentralized trust. And what is raw decentralized trust? Like, what is decentralized trust composed of? Decentless Trust. But it's a marketplace for decentralized trust distilled into a specific product called block space. The block space economy is clearly emerging in Ethereum to be one of the preeminent economies in the crypto space.

  Speaker 1
  You take this like group of nodes and stake and stuff and there's a particular coordination consensus layer called the beacon chain. And then there's a particular execution layer called the EVM. And then on top of which, there's a particular things like the gas limits. And then it induces this thing called block space. Oh, you have 15 million block space, 15 million gas every 12 seconds or whatever. And essentially, Ethereum itself is a marketplace for decentralized trust, right? But it's decentralized trust distilled into a specific product called block space. So you have this notion of decentralized trust. It goes to the consensus, goes to the execution, it goes to the gas limits and then creates an object called block space. And the block space economy is clearly emerging in Ethereum to be one of the preeminent economies in the crypto space, precisely because the raw material of, like I said, every crypto solution needs decentralized trust. And Ethereum is a marketplace for decentralized trust. But it's a marketplace for decentralized trust distilled in a specific direction, using a certain consensus protocol, using a certain virtual machine, a certain scalability layer, and a certain gas limit leading to this economy of the block space. But decentralized trust itself can be supplied potentially in a much more raw manner. And that's what Eigenlayer is. Eigenlayer is a marketplace for raw decentralized trust. And what is raw decentralized trust? Like, what is decentralized trust composed of? ([Time 0:29:28](https://share.snipd.com/snip/36fee1f8-590f-44a8-a8ce-05d98fbb0b93))
    - **Note:** Eigenlayer is a raw marketplace for decentralized trust where ethereum is decentralized trust regarding ethereum blocks eogenlayer expands the surface area v
- Staking Ethereum on Eigenlayer for Increased Yield and Smart Contract Risk
  Summary:
  From a staker's perspective, you could stake your ETH at like 4 to 6 percent. You take on some smart contract risk. And then you opt into the applications or change you want to support. So there's more risk here. But now I may be going from a four to six percent type yield to like a seven, eight, nine, 10 percent.You really can't predict this, because you're just the marketplace for this and the market will determine what the true yield is.

  And then anyone who wants to tap into the trust list, a security of Ethereum is going to have to pay some premium on top of that. So from a staker's perspective, you could stake your ETH at like four to six percent. Analyze, you restake it in eigenlayer. You take on some smart contract risk. And then you opt into the applications or change you want to support. And you can further increase your yield above the risk free rate. So there's more risk here. But now I may be going from a four to six percent type yield to like a seven, eight, nine, 10 percent. You really can't predict this, because you're just the marketplace for this. And the market will determine what the true yield is. Is this all correct?
  Speaker 1
  That is absolutely correct. In terms of things like the smart contract risks on eigenlayer, I think definitely that is a significant aspect of how we think about when we try to build systems, we are trying to think of not only mechanisms on how to audit the contracts, how to make sure that we have very minimal surface. But still, we also think of other things. For example, in eigenlayer, there is when before you withdraw your money out, there is a withdrawal lag of seven days. And this is true for most taking and unstaking protocols. It is not a short term activity like a bridge where you're like, oh, you know, why is my funds still there?

    - **Note:** Restaking allows you to pledge eth to secure more things and this enhances your return on eth stake above the base level.
