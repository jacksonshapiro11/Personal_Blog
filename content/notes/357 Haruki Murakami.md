  Speaker 1
  One runner told his mantra, here it is. Pain is inevitable, suffering is optional. Say you're running and you start to think, man, this hurts, I can't take it anymore. The hurt part is an unavoidable reality, but whether or not you can stand anymore is up to the runner himself. So I suppose it's alright to read this as a kind of memoir centered on the act of running. This book does contain a certain amount of what might be dubbed life lessons. They are personal lessons I've learned through actually putting my own body in motion and thereby discovering that suffering is optional. That was an excerpt from the forward of the book that I'm going to talk to you about today, which is what I talk about when I talk about running a memoir and it was written by Haruki Murakami. So before I jump into the book, I want to give you background into the unexpected way. I was not expecting to make a podcast about this book. I didn't know this book existed before a couple days ago. So I actually stumbled across this book on Twitter. So then what I did is I love to read. I always read physical books. But what I'll do is if I discover a new book, I will test it out by buying the Kindle version and I'll start reading it. And then usually if I like the first few chapters, then I'll order the physical book because that's how I prefer to read and that's how I like to make the podcast and everything else.

    - **Note:** Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional. He’s consistency over intensity. He runs a 10k every day and writes for five hours, but knows he can do more gives up every day before it stops becoming fun. He was a writer and a runner because it fit his personality. You must find something unique to you, you can’t fake who you are long term. Running down a dream do things that are authentic to you. He sets a high internal bar for himself and doesn’t worry about what the outside world says to him. He runs to let his mind rest and wonder it opens a line to your unconscious. He lives up to his own standards that’s his own bar and doesn’t worry about others strong internal locus for control. Create your own independent self. Emotional hurt is the pain someone has to go through to be independent. He processes pain through physical activity when he’s annoyed he goes running.
- Embrace Direct Feedback from End Users

  The transition to a writer led to weight gain and decreased energy levels due to a lack of physical activity, highlighting the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle while pursuing creative endeavors.

  Readers though, seem to love this new book. And that is what makes me happiest. There's a great quote about this from James Dyson. If you can try to go direct to the end user of your product because he said the entrenched professional is always going to resist far longer than the private consumer. Thank God that gatekeeper, that publisher didn't get in the way. Oh, we don't like this. We're looking for something more mainstream. That is the entrenched professional, right? But the private consumers like we love this, give more. Now we've been talking about this journey from bar owner, jazz club owner to novelist, but how does this tie with the book, with his, this diary, this inner monologue about running? How did he, he's not a runner yet. Now he's a novelist, he solved that problem, but he hasn't found that second obsession, that second obsession that's going to serve his first obsession. How does he do that? Well, he tells us. The problem arose. With my decision to become a professional writer. The question was how to keep physically fit. Running the bar required hard physical labor every day, and I could keep my weight down. But once I started sitting at my desk all day writing, my energy level gradually declined and I started putting on pounds. I was also smoking too much as I concentrated on my work. Back then I was smoking 60 cigarettes a day. ([Time 0:29:13](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fcf1ca8f-fc36-4e48-8c35-ed1f07758e7c))
    - **Note:** He is working at a jazz club and owns it and he’s a workhorse not a racehorse has a strict schedule every day and despite having no business knowledge is able to make it successful but one day he’s at a baseball game and has the idea to write a novel so he just does it send in the only manuscript autotelic action because it’s something done for itself he’s just happy he wrote it doesn’t care if it gets published or anyone reads it. Book gets published does well still running the club and writes another book in spurts but realizes he wants to be a writer full time and this is his chance so he quits and sells the jazz club despite that being his main source of income to go all in on writing. People tell him not to but he follows his dream. He wanted to go all in he doesn’t like half assing wanted to give this writing thing a go. He knew he can probably go start another club, but this was just one moment to be a writer. The publishers didn’t love his second book but the people and his fans did which is who matters.

  Speaker 1
  Thanks to this, I've been able to work efficiently these past 24 years. And now he's into, you know, 40 years he's been doing this. I also found this interview, when I got to this part, I was also reading and listening to interviews that he's done. And I found this interview about his daily schedule, very interesting. It was this from this 2004 interview. And so he describes his daily schedule, but I think the last few sentences is really what's important. So he talks about, you know, I get up at 4am. I've already told you this, he writes for five to six hours, then he'll go run 10 kilometers and swim 1500 meters, then read a bit, listen to some music and go to bed early. Now, this is the important part. I keep to this routine every day without variation. The repetition itself becomes the most important thing. It is a form of mesmerism. I mesmerize myself to reach a deeper state of mind. The power of routine is a reoccurring theme throughout the entire book. He goes back to it. I'm struck by how, except when you're young, you really need to prioritize in your life. Figure out in what order you should divide up your time and energy. If you don't get that sort of system set by a certain age, you'll lack focus and your life will be out of balance. I placed the highest priority on the sort of life that lets me focus on writing. Why? Because writing is an act of service. ([Time 0:34:01](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1bffafbc-530e-4fcc-b27e-17d179d992f0))
    - **Note:** When you’re young, you need to purposefully divide your life into how you can effectively split up your time or else your screwed. He had a followed a good routine that made him successful. His routine and systems made him yiu must develop good routines and systems to chase your dream the younger the better. He also realized when he became a writer he was smoking 60 cigs a day and putting on weight so he picked up running this Fit his personality of being able to do it alone for self reliance and was able to be healthy. This was something he did because he really enjoyed it. Focuses his life on routine and the most important relationship he has is with his readers business comes as a result of service Henry Ford your customers are the most important. Built an invisible Relationship with his mass of readers was indespensible. Actions express priority what you do leads to your successful or failure

  Speaker 1
  Maybe 70% says, this sucks. 10% says, this is OK. 10% is like, yeah, I kind of liked it. But 10% really love it. And so he talks about the fact that he just focused on writing what other people thought was unorthodox, but it was completely authentic to him. It was differentiated from the other novels out there, and it found its market. And over time, since he was doing this for the long term, he says every time he released a new novel, he had more readers. It didn't matter if a new novel came out and 90% of the stuff said, you know, that's not for me, that 10% loved it. And then they told other people and that 10% slowly grew over time. And he has a great line in the book to describe this perspective. He says there's no need to be literature's top runner. And I was like, Oh, I read that. And in the context of everything else that's going on the story, it's like, oh, he approached building his customer base the same way you would approach building up and increasing the Length of distance that you can run over time, year after year. And so then he illustrates this point through training through running. This goes back to this idea of he's clearly, if you analyze what he's doing, he's clearly prioritizing consistency over intensity. And it's clear as he's talking about these dual obsessions that his skill at running and his skill at business were built the very same way. There's this little bit every day. I'm going to read this to you. And then I want to quote one of my favorite essays, which is how to do great work by Paul Graham. So Mirakami says, when I first started running, I couldn't run long distances. ([Time 0:38:11](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b3e5112c-c122-4ad8-92db-bf1740728201))
    - **Note:** His writing philosophy was similar to his running philosophy and he learned it when he ran the bar you can’t keep everyone happy but if you keep one to 10 people coming back, you can build a very successful business, but those people have to love your product you need to be very successful within a niche, but that does not have to be the world. Focus on your unique differentiation. People who do great things don’t get a lot done every day, but if you’re at a page a day, you write at a novel in a year. Power of routine. When something suits you it’s easy for you to do. Find what suits you you can’t fake passion. Optimize for freedom and do what you love. No one can tell you what you wanna do. You have to figure that out for yourself and it’s different for everyone. There is no magic bullet or general answer. The meaning of life is 42. Decide who you want to be and become this person. There are some days where you don’t want to run but greatness is showing up when you don’t feel perfect, 100%. You don’t need good feeling to do things all the time sometimes when you don’t want to you just gotta push through and do it

  Speaker 1
  It's pretty thin, the walls separating healthy confidence and unhealthy pride." And his reaction to this was perfect. You go back to the basics and you recommit yourself to your training schedule. He says, as I ran this race, I felt I never ever wanted to go through that again. Right then and there, I decided that before my next marathon, I was going to go back to the basics, start from scratch, and do the very best I could train meticulously and rediscover what I was physically capable of, tighten up all the loose screws, one by one, do all of that and see what happens. And part of what happened is, you know, he said, as you get older, you get busier, he becomes, you know, more well known, he's got all kinds of different opportunities to go his way. A lot of those are just, you know, the external world is largely an external distraction. And what he realizes is there's always going to be more reasons not to run, not to spend the time doing this than there are to do that, You have to hold on to the few precious, valuable reasons. And he says, even if there were two of me, I still couldn't do all that has to be done. No matter what, I keep up my running. Running every day is a kind of lifeline for me. So I'm not going to lay off running or quit just because I'm busy. If I use being busy as an excuse not to run, I'd never again. I only have a few reasons to keep on running and a truckload of them to quit. All I can do is keep those few reasons nicely polished.

    - **Note:** He committed to running a marathon every year, but one year he had to walk to finish it and this was because he got cocky and didn’t train enough. There’s no substitute for the work. You just have to do it always be excuses, but you need to prioritize what you wanna do because there’s always more you can do than you wanna do , once you do that commit to those things deeply don’t waffle. Keep the few reasons to keep doing something at the fore front ignore all the excuses. What made him a great writer was deep focus and endurance consistency over time. There is a benefit to sitting at a table for 8 hours a day with nothing to do but write even if you don’t write you give yourself no alternative and eventually success comes through this practice. He wanted to live life to the fullest and live his unique life. He lived life to the fullest fully alive given into his obsessions lived the life he wanted every day surrendering to the life he wanted to live. He is having the time of his life living his life to the fullest. Anything worth doing is doing to excess. You can go too far he ran an ultra marathon and this excess made him hate running for years. Broke his spirit. Be very introspective before finding your life’s work then forget it completely and surrender to the thing once you do. Ben Franklin on dating. When you find what you want become a shark wake up and move. Essence of decision is cutting away all others paths.
