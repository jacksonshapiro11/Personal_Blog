  Speaker 1
  That is an excerpt from the book that I'm going to talk to you about today, which is titled Tiger Woods, and it was written by Jeff Benedict and Armin Contain. There is a companion to this fantastic biography. It is an excellent documentary that I watched a few years ago, maybe like a year ago, on HBO, it's simply called Tiger. And so when they said, hey, you know, why we read this, why we writing this book, very few individuals are known throughout the world by one word a few months ago, I was in Los Angeles and I was going to a bookshop, a bookstore, and I noticed this book. And it speaks to what they're talking about, the fact that he is known just by the word tiger, but he's also known by just his face. I saw the book. There is no title on the cover of the book. All it is is Tiger's face and I immediately knew what it was about. And then the reason I picked it up is because it says on the cover that it was the basis of the HBO documentary Tiger. I was like, Oh, wow, I should actually, I like the document. I should read the book. And so in addition to reading this book, I also rewatch the documentary. And so I want to start in the prologue with a main reoccurring thing that you and I have talked about over and over again that pops up in nearly every single biography that you and I talk about that you can always understand the son by the story of his father, the story of the father is embedded in the son. That is a quote from Francis Ford copilos biography regarding the relationship that Francis had with his father. I covered all the back on episode 242. ([Time 0:04:12](https://share.snipd.com/snip/26222ca3-f854-4eab-9db0-e870b1f424a3))
    - **Note:** The story of the father is imbedded in the son. Tiger was a transcendent athlete and introvert.
- The Strong Religious Element in Mozart's Life and Earl Woods' Belief in Tiger's Genius
  Key takeaways:
  - Mozart's father had a strong religious element in his life and thought educating his son was a profound spiritual and professional business
  - Earl Woods believed that Tiger was a gift of God to golf and dedicated his life to his son's amateur and professional golf career
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  When Mozart was four, his father decided to concentrate on bringing him out and virtually gave up on composing and performing himself. Earl was retired from the Navy. He had no other job than dedicating his, his, his self to his young sons, golf amateur golf career and then professional career. He soon came to the conclusion that he had father to genius. That's what Earl's just said. Being a very highly religious man, he that he was responsible for a gift of God to music. So he talks about the fact, Earl talks about the fact that this is like, you know, just what's meant to be. This is from God. I don't know if I consider Earl a religious man. There's a lot in this, this biography that's actually shocking. Back to Mozart. It is important to grasp the strong religious element, raiding from his father that existed in Mozart's life from his infancy. Mozart's father felt that the musical education of his son was a profound spiritual business as well as a professional one. So did Earl. He literally thought that, that, that Tiger was like the anointed one. Like he just said, that he's going to that through golf, he's going to like cure racism and all this. He just got a very interesting, like almost like Messiah like vision for his son. I guess is the way to put that. And then one more highlight before we jump back into the Tiger book, he, Mozart's father's often seen as a tyrant towards his children. There's no way you're going to read the book and not think Earl's the same way. But the fact is he surrendered his own future as a musician for their sake and their progress justified his sacrifice. ([Time 0:09:13](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3efa2b32-c8a1-4732-8bb8-73c07adb7cf6))
    - **Note:** Parallels between motzart and tigers fathers. They both thought their sons were gifts from god. They started at their craft before they could walk and had a great work ethic and a ton of talent. Transcendent people.
- Tiger Woods' Early Years: Intense Training and Remarkable Observation
  Key takeaways:
  - Tiger Woods was nicknamed after a comrade from Vietnam
  - Tiger spent between 100 and 200 hours watching his father hit golf balls by the time he was one
  - Tiger was so transfixed by his father's swing that he'd wait to eat until the swing was done
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  He immediately nicknamed his son Tiger and tribute to a comrade from Vietnam. And then we go back to more notes where I feel even silly for writing intense training before Tiger was won. By the time Tiger turned one, he had spent 100 and between 100 and 200 hours watching his father hit golf balls. So what they would do is they got the garage, they'd put him in a high chair and Earl would just sit there and swing and hit into the net over and over again. Tiger got so transfixed by this, he would watch his mother would try to defeat him and he would not eat. He'd wait till the swing like the swing was done. Then he'd turn and open his mouth so his mom could feed him. He'd take one bite, then look again, stare at the stare at the swing back and forth. That's how he ate. When Tiger was about 11 months old after watching his father practice, Tiger slid down from his high chair and picked up a club that Earl had cut down to size for him to make a new tour. He waddled over to the carpet patch, stood over a golf ball and swung. All these things that I'm reading or having over over many, many pages, it's insane how consistent this is. Instead of carrying around a security blanket or stuffed animal, Tiger dragged around a putter from one of the house to the other. It's seldom left his hand. Earl deserved credit for recognizing so early on that his son possessed rare natural talents and abilities just like Mozart's dad. When he was 18 months old, his mother started bringing him to the driving range to hit balls. After Tiger, like the baby version of Tiger, toddler version of Tiger, would hit balls. ([Time 0:12:09](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3cc3014d-5d62-4fc7-af9c-eca7cfdeddfd))
    - **Note:** His dad was a green beret who fell in love with golf. Tiger at the age of 5 would go to the range every day after school. Extreme introvert. Walking around with a putter at 2.
- Earl Woods' Bold Prediction: His Two-Year-Old Son Will Revolutionize Golf and Race Relations
  Key takeaways:
  - Earl Woods aggressively pursued attention for his son's golf skills from a very young age.
  - Earl Woods called a TV station to declare his 2-year-old son would revolutionize golf.
  - Earl's bold declaration to a sports anchor yielded positive results as the anchor witnessed Tiger's golf abilities firsthand.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Earl is, this is the strange part where he's like constantly trying to get attention for a son even from a very early age. And we see how wild and like almost like Messianic, his, how he feels about a son. Earl Woods made a decision that would alter the course of his young son's life. He placed a call to a television station and asked for the sports anchor. My son is two years old, Earl said, and I'm telling you right now that he's going to be the next big thing in golf. He's going to revolutionize everything including race relations. This sentence might be the funniest sentence in the entire book. It was a blunt way to open a call with a complete stranger. So this sports anchor goes out, it's like, oh, yeah, there's a lot of overzealous parents. This might be BS, but let me go out here and see if that's the case. And he's like, oh, well, he might be right, not on the really race relations, but this might be the next biggest thing in golf. I see this little tiger hitting golf balls straight. I mean, straight, not kind of straight, straight. He was only a couple feet tall, yet he was hitting at 50 yards and he was hitting the ball flush every time. And so anybody that sees Tiger Woods golf, it's like you have a gifted, you know, once in a century talent, his teachers would say the same thing. Tiger showed unmistakable signs of being a bona fide gifted child in school. He shared the textbook attributes of the gifted child, quiet, sensitive and isolated. And so his parents don't really have any money, but they find ways throughout the entire book to get professional help, even from an early age. By the time I think he's 13, Tiger's getting recruited by like Stanford. ([Time 0:14:45](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0058bc52-9ce2-4949-a09f-997807004d10))
    - **Note:** Tiger was incredibly gifted and talented.
- Tiger Woods' Motivational Self-Talk Messages from Childhood
  Key takeaways:
  - Tiger Woods listened to motivational self-help tapes provided by his father in grade school
  - Tiger wrote the key messages from the tapes on a sheet of paper and taped it to his bedroom wall
  - The messages included phrases like 'I believe in me' and 'My will moves mountains'
  - Tiger listened to the tapes so often that he wore them out
  - Tiger Woods shares similarities with other great athletes like Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant in their commitment to studying and improving their craft
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So says Tiger was in grade school when his father furnished him with a cassette player and motivational self-help tapes. Tiger was filling his mind with words that were intended to make him great. He wrote some of the messages on a sheet of paper that he taped to his bedroom wall. So he taped it to his wall and then read it over and over again. What are these messages? I'm going to read that every line to you. I believe in me. I will own my own destiny. I smile at obstacles. I am first in my resolve. I fulfill my resolutions powerfully. My strength is great. I stick to it easily and naturally. My will moves mountains. I focus and give it my all. My decisions are strong. I do it with all my heart. And then the author says, Tiger listened to those tapes so often that he wore them out. So now we're going to see another parallel with Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant as well. Michael Jordan would watch tapes of like Dr. J, all these other NBA players that came before him. And then Kobe in turn, certain watch tapes of Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson. Same thing. 10 year old Tiger. You don't get to the top of your profession without studying the great people who came before you. This is very clear. Now we're 301 biographies in and this is in nearly every single one of them. 10 year old Tiger Woods started stared intently at the television. ([Time 0:18:25](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a45d6dd3-17b7-42c4-b3af-c7c6d8471146))
    - **Note:** Tiger studied the greats in his field and formed his mental strength from a young age through listening to Tony robbons like mental affirmation tapes.
- Tiger Woods' Inspiration: Hanging Achievements on the Wall
  Key takeaways:
  - Tiger Woods emulated rappers like Nas by printing out their lyrics and hanging them on the wall as inspiration
  - Tiger had a specific set of goals based on achieving golf milestones at a younger age than his idols
  - The misconception about what drives Tiger Woods is that he was solely focused on breaking Jack Nicklaus' major records
  - Instead, Tiger was striving to achieve his own set of first-time golf milestones, including breaking 40 and 80, winning his first golf tournament and amateur championships.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I've heard interviews with him and he's also mentioned some songs. When he was young, he would literally print out other rappers like Nas that he looked up to and print out their lyrics and hang them up on the wall. That is exactly that Jay Cole's version is exactly what Tiger is doing with Jack Nicholas's achievements. Tiger mentions this in the book and is also in that file that David Parell sent me that his goals were confused that what he was chasing was pure numbers. He's like, no, I wanted to do it when younger than they were. He talks about this is a quote from Tiger that David sent me. Is there a misconception about what drives you? This is what Tiger says. Here's the major misconception that people have gotten all wrong. It's what was posted on my wall about Jack's records. It was not the majors. That one was on there, but it was the first time he broke 40. The first time he broke 80. The first golf tournament he ever won. First time he ever won the state amateur. First time he won the US amateur and the first time he won the US Open. That was it. That was the list. It was all age related to me that was most important. This guy is the best out there and the best of all time. If I can beat each age that he did it, then I have a chance at being the best. If you buy the book and read it, which I highly recommend, there's no reason not to. And watch the documentary. I'm focused on like things that you and I can take for our work and our career. That's the point. Learning from history is a form of leverage. ([Time 0:20:55](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4a5e8788-a71c-481e-b992-c0b3a978c495))
    - **Note:** He hung jacks accomplishments on his wall and tracked how he was doing at each age when he broke 80 ect.
- Insights on Tiger Woods' Family Dynamics and Father's Unmarked Grave
  Key takeaways:
  - Tiger's mother called for his father's death at 11 years old
  - Tiger's father is buried in an unmarked grave due to his mother's actions
  - Tiger's parents were separated and his father cheated on his wife over and over again
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  He's just in a nigma where you read Jordan's biography and his autobiography. You have a sense of who he is. This is very different. Now, that's the thing that popped mine. This is a note I left on my page on this page. Okay. Later on in this book, Tiger's mom said that Tiger's dad was soft because his because his dad cries and he forgives. And then they make the connection. The book opens up with the death of his father and then bearing his father. I think it was in Kansas where he was born. And they make the point that a decade later there's no grave. There's he's in a Tiger's dad is in an unmarked grave. And he's not in an unmarked grave because of Tiger. He's in an unmarked grave because of his mother. They were they were they were technically never divorced, but they were separated to live separately. You know, he cheated on his wife over and over again. And this you never make the connection, right? She's telling her 11 year old go kill him. No mercy. Go for the throat. Don't act friendly at all. Later on, she's like, there's no point in having friends in life. Like she's a uh, Earl and her almost like the same person. And so these are not people. My point is it's like, I would never wish I don't think any parent is going to wish for this environment for their kids. So the reason I don't I'm not going to get heavy into judging him is because this happens. ([Time 0:24:46](https://share.snipd.com/snip/eedd9d79-1228-47ec-bed3-5d2d16edc6d0))
    - **Note:** His parents were momstered not great people but instilled the killer instinct in tiger at a young age. She never forgave and burried his dad in an unmarked grave.
- Tiger Woods: Dominance on the Junior Circuit and High School Golf Boundaries
  Key takeaways:
  - Tiger Woods dominated the Southern California Junior Circuit at an elite tournament
  - Tiger was considered a decade ahead of other junior players
  - Tiger's high school adjusted boundaries to keep him on the golf team
  - There are comparisons between Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan throughout the book
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Tiger simply overwhelmed the competition on the Southern California Junior Circuit at an elite tournament that attracted the finest players in the region. Tiger absolutely dominated. He was in their estimation a decade ahead of the other kids. And then here's just one of another insane story that it's hard to believe it's in the book. Imagine being so good at golf that the school district changes the boundaries for you. Tiger entered Western High School. Western High's golf coach Don Crosby felt like his fledgling golf team had won the lottery when Tiger arrived. Months before school started the district was considering a modest boundary change that would have put Tigers home just outside of the Western High District. In an urgent meeting with Western High's principal Crosby took out a map and drew a circle around this specific parcel of land. Whatever you do this summer Crosby told the principal do not lose this track. Why? The principal said because a kid named Tiger Woods lives there. And then we go back to the Michael Jordan is Tiger Woods. Tiger Woods is Michael Jordan. Something that pops up over and over again in this book. My favorite maxim for this is the public praises people for what they practice in private. And we see that over and over again. Tiger often average more than 10 hours per day on the practice range. Tiger was far more inclined to practice than to play a round of golf. There's a line just like that in Michael Jordan's Michael Jordan's biography. ([Time 0:30:25](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e17ece90-b168-4ee0-a9f8-e4a7539d58d6))
    - **Note:** Tiger spent 10 hours on the range and never played. People praise what happens in private. His dad used prisoner of war techniques to sharpen his mind and make him mentally tough.
- Tiger Woods' obsession with US Navy SEALs and the 'violence of action' mindset in his golf swing
  Key takeaways:
  - Tiger Woods became obsessed with US Navy SEALs and trained to become one, which likely caused problems with his golf game due to injuries
  - Tiger Woods learned about violence of action from the Navy SEALs and it reminded the author of the speed and power of Tiger's swing early in his career
  - Tiger Woods swung so violently that he had raw spots on his forearm from the friction created by their rubbing together on his release
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Later on Tiger Woods is going to be obsessed with US Navy SEALs he winds up training with them has this idea to quit golf and to become a Navy SEAL later on likely causes like a lot of problems with his golf game because he aggravates some of his injuries like this intense training that he's going to but he has this idea which like this US I think it comes from the Navy SEALs about violence of action and violence of action is the unrestricted use of speed strength and surprise and aggression to achieve total dominance against your enemy. I have no idea why but when I got to this section their description of Tiger's swing early in his career reminded me of violence of action. It was the speed and power of Tiger's swing that left the most lasting impression the adjective that came to mind was violent. Tiger swung so violently that he had raw spots on his forearm from the friction created by their rubbing together on on his release. What's your go-to shot when you aren't swinging well? Harmon asked. I think it's first or second swing coach. Swing as fast as I can unleash everything I have through the ball then I go find the ball and I hit it again. Swing as fast as I can unleash everything I have through the ball then I go find the ball and hit it again. Violence of action in the form of a golf swing and so then it goes into some of the ([Time 0:33:06](https://share.snipd.com/snip/90f161d3-fe6a-4b10-abec-def44ffd0170))
    - **Note:** Tiger believed in violence of action to the extremes he even trained with navy seals.
- Bill Bowerman's early emphasis on rest and recovery in athletics
  Key takeaways:
  - Bill Bowerman was the co-founder of Nike and a legendary track coach who was decades ahead of his time in understanding the importance of resting recovery.
  - Bowerman emphasized the importance of resting and recovery to his athletes and was admired by Phil Knight, who he never let over train.
  - Bowerman's speech to incoming freshmen track athletes emphasized the importance of taking care of one's body for optimal performance.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  But Bill Bowerman, I read his biography back on episode 153. Bill Bowerman is the co-founder of Nike. He's a legendary track coach. Phil Knight, you know, has been on record over and over again saying that there is no Nike without Bill Bowerman. And the interesting thing about Bill Bowerman was, wait, this is decade, people know the importance of resting recovery now, but he was decades ahead of the curve. And so in that biography, back on episode 153, I'm going to read from it real quick, he talks about the fact that he just sees class after class after class of track, track stars, right? And they all make the same mistake and that they don't rest and they get injured and then their career goes to shit. And I just wonder if he had a strong influence, you know, Phil Knight is a very formidable individual. And yet he was able, like he listened to and admired Bowerman. Bowerman never let Phil Knight over train. And so this is the speech that Bowerman would give to the incoming freshmen incoming track athletes every year. Take a primitive organism. Any week pitiful organism, say a freshman, you make it lift or jump or run, and then you let it rest. What happens? A little miracle. It gets a little better. It gets a little stronger, a little faster, a little more enduring. That's all training is stress, recover, improve. You think any damn fool could do it, but you don't. You work too hard and rest too little and you get hurt. ([Time 0:40:17](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a1320a21-1618-48bf-9af6-ebb25fcc9fa4))
    - **Note:** When you work too hard and rest too little you get hurt. Work add stress then rest and recover.
- Tiger Woods turns pro and receives praise from Michael Jordan and Phil Knight
  Key takeaways:
  - Tiger Woods turned pro with Nike's encouragement and secured 60 million dollars before playing his first round of golf as a pro
  - Michael Jordan was one of Tiger's idols and Jordan publicly stated that his only hero on earth is Tiger Woods
  - Tiger's father publicly spoke about his son's potential to be greater than Gandhi and Mandela
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I'm independent in strong will that way you survive. And so eventually Tiger makes the decision much with Nike's encouragement. Phil Knight's a character that pops up as much cameos of him in the book as well. And so he makes this decision. He's going to turn pro and he gets to meet starts getting to meet Michael Jordan who he idolized says Jordan was another story. Tiger had idolized him throughout his teenage years. Phil Knight even saw Tiger as Jordan's equal. When asked whether Tiger was comparable to Jordan Knight said flatly you bet your ass he is. Jordan the world's most famous athlete publicly stated that his only hero on earth is Tiger Woods. It was a hell of a compliment for a 20 year old. Tiger was too young to drink but with two strokes of a pen he had secured 60 million dollars before playing his first round of golf as a pro around this time. This is where his dad's start starting to talk publicly about his 20 year old son. He's going to be Gandhi's going to be Mandela's going to be better than all of them. I know I was personally selected by God himself to nurture this young man. That is exactly exactly what Mozart's father said. And so they have an entire chapter dedicated to the 1997 Masters. I just want to go back to this point that the world is a very malleable place. Tiger had sat in his living room at age 10 watching Jack Nicholas win the 1986 Masters on television and dreamed of doing just that. ([Time 0:42:25](https://share.snipd.com/snip/53c07ef3-081f-41d1-aed4-7ad5418400a7))
    - **Note:** The world is a malleable place.
- Tiger Woods' Early Regimen and Compulsive Habits
  Summary:
  Tiger Woods, influenced by watching Jack Nicholas win the 1986 Masters at age 10, developed a rigorous practice regimen characterized by hitting 600 balls, working on short game and putting, playing rounds of golf, and spending hours in the gym.
  Woods exhibited compulsive habits with a relentless drive for improvement, even after significant victories. Winning tournaments only briefly satisfied him, as he was addicted to continuous practice and improvement, showing a relentless intensity and competitive spirit that defined his approach from a young age.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Tiger had sat in his living room at age 10 watching Jack Nicholas win the 1986 Masters on television and dreamed of doing just that. Here he was 11 years later and Jack Nicholas was now elbowing his way through the masses of spectators trying to get a glimpse of Tiger. And so we go back into what was his practice habits like what was his regimen after he turned pro and it goes back to maybe this is who knows you have to ask if he went back and did it would he Would he take more like a baron approach or is it like hey he just has this like ruthless intensity and drive and competitive spirit that maybe he couldn't even control. And so it says Tiger had compulsive habits. By the spring of 1997 he was consumed with practicing and working out a typical practice day for him and tailed hitting 600 balls working on a short game working on his putting and then Playing around a golf and working out in the gym for two or three hours. That was the life I wanted he said and he never rested after win. The joy he derived from winning tournaments was always fleeting. Even after shattering records at Augusta wasn't enough. I didn't care if I won I didn't care that I won by 12 shots he said I was addicted to staying on the range for hours. And so right away as he turns pro he's breaking records he's winning all the time and then this is a this goes this is really helpful to have David Peral text me and and send me all this stuff Because you know I'm not I don't understand golf the way he does and he's like listen the man is wild. ([Time 0:43:39](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ee2996b9-030a-4193-b20f-04ecd275e956))
    - **Note:** Relentless never resting on his laurels. Go to bed on a win wake up with a loss. He rebuilt his swing as world #1 twice while he was still #1. Relentless improvement. He wanted to win and loved collecting trophies. He saw his swing long term wasn’t optimal so would change it. Insanely ruthless
- Tiger Woods' Obsession with Perfection and Visualization Technique for Golf Success
  Key takeaways:
  - Tiger Woods stands out as a rare athlete who enjoys practicing and playing.
  - His obsession with perfection and ability to perform without fear gives him a psychological advantage.
  - Woods' visualization technique before games gives him an edge.
  - His ability to do things that nobody else is capable of gives him an exceptional advantage.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  As far as he hits it there's no reason for him to even bother practicing his short game but he has and that is why he is winning. I don't know if anybody can play the way he does. He has the ability to do things that nobody else can. And then there's a bunch of golfers in this book just talked about if you competed with him at this point it was very intimidating. Woods was a rare athlete who liked to practice so much and he liked to play. Whose obsession with perfection and ability to perform without fear gave him intimidating psychological advantage. And so then goes into his mindset his inner monologue. He's the night before the last day of play. He would just he'd get in a room. He started doing this visualization. He says no one else stands a chance tomorrow. That night alone in his room room Woods would close his eyes. He visualized the first tee. From there he played every shot in his mind one by one all the way through the 18th hole. Then he went to sleep. The next day he shot 65 in the opening round with three rounds still to play. Everyone else had already recognized that they were playing for second place. So I thought that was the night before the last day that was wrong. I still have three rounds to go. This idea of visualization sounds to a lot of people about hey it's Willie Fufu. It's like some nonsense. All I can tell you is that it is in a ton of the biographies that I read. When I type in visualization in read wise I pull up all the notes and highlights I have about this. This is Estee Lauder. ([Time 0:47:25](https://share.snipd.com/snip/80fdbf65-a7f1-47c6-a7ff-47f294f12358))
    - **Note:** Tiger would go through every shot on every hole and visualize success. Believe before you achieve. Este lauder also did this. You need to visualize success.
- Tiger Woods' Attention to Detail in the Game of Golf
  Key takeaways:
  - Tiger Woods was a master of every facet of the game, including equipment
  - Nike sent Woods six prototype drivers to test, which he put through their paces
  - Woods noticed a difference in the feel of one driver, even though all six were supposed to be the exact same weight
  - Upon investigation, Nike found that an engineer had added a dab of extra goo inside the head of one driver
  - This two-gram difference in weight was imperceptible to most people but Woods noticed
  - Woods had an unsurpassed talent for noticing even the slightest differences in his equipment
  Transcript:
