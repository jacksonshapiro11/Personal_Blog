  Speaker 1
  And Kett is now at this section about the retreat. I think he's around 70 years old going back and reflecting on everything he learned from this guy named Neil McLaughlin. So it says, Neil taught his pupils to think in and around and through, Kettering recalled, or Kett recalled. Youngsters, and this is Kett continuing, youngsters naturally have exploring minds. He said expressing his philosophy of education. They should be encouraged to quest and question. The trouble is we don't get interested in the commonplace things and it is the commonplace things that make up the universe. So Kett definitely implies that philosophy when he's a teacher. Now Kett, like many of the people we said in the podcast, they're very resourceful. And we see this early resourcefulness because he's walking three miles to school and three miles back. And he's like, Hey, let me not waste this walk. And so he says, in those daily walks, in those daily walks back and forth between the farm and school, Kett often stopped at the big flower mill in the town, which was powered not by water, Not by a water wheel, but by a steam engine. Remember, he most of his life is is consistent working on engines. And so this is the first time he starts learning about it. He made friends with the men who tended the engine and ran the mill.

    - **Note:** Charles wanted to know how everything worked he didn’t just care that combustion made a car go but wanted to know what combustion was. He was unwilling to believe anything was impossible. He inspired everyone around him. Interested in the common thing that make up the universe and relentlessly resourceful. He believed in practical knowledge over theory and the importance of understanding versus knowing. His exposure to windmills as a kid set his entire life for working with engines. If you can’t do anything about a situation you can’t worry about it it’s useless. Understanding principles not rote memorization. He was a misfit and thought independently about situations. He wanted to integrate knowledge into a larger system. Collected people and learned from others.
      Good quote so leaving and adding more notes here
      He cares about simplicity and first principles Feynman on magnets. Didn’t believe anything was impossible high agency and very resourceful practical over theoretical knowledge and knowing vs understanding. Thought independently and collected people integrated knowledge is a system not just at a point by understanding deeper principles can’t connect the dots looking forward b
- Henry Ford's Perseverance
  Key takeaways:
  - Henry Ford faced numerous moments of discouragement and wanting to quit throughout his entrepreneurial journey.
  - Listening to this podcast can help reinforce belief in oneself and cultivate resilience.
  - Believing in one's ability to achieve goals is a common trait among successful individuals.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  There's times where we're discouraged. I think back to that that that that excerpt in our that paragraph, I guess sections better way to put it in my 40 years with Ford, where this is third, this is now for its third attempt at Building an automobile manufacturing company and he comes to see chart the author of the book is Charles Sorensen and he comes to see Charlie and he's just like, you know what, we're About to run out of money. I guess I'm just not going to have my, you know, I'm just not going to be able to accomplish this goal. And you know, there's this conversation that that takes place between the two people and eventually at the end, Ford is like, he's fired back up. He's like, you know what, I felt like quitting at the beginning of this conversation. Now I don't and that in just a few short years later, he winds up attaining his life goal as one single goal of building a car so inexpensively that, you know, the average people can have It. So I just think it's important. Like that's Henry Ford, one of the most successful entrepreneurs of all time. And he there's so many times in his life story that he wants to quit that he's disheartened. And I think the difference is that the benefit of listening to this podcast is like you're going to be brain, like a lot of people already believe in themselves. So there's two things are going to happen. One, you're going to be brainwashed into believing in yourself and the people that are already believing themselves, you mean you brainwashed into not quitting because that's the Two main traits of almost every single person is like they believe in their ability to do what they were setting up to do. ([Time 0:23:13](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1eb40aaa-3d98-4cc8-b02b-e4e8c2e5fbd2))
    - **Note:** Believe in your ability to do what you want to do and never quit. Kett was going blind but worked hard to turn this into a strength. He developed his mental abilities at this time. He refuses to accept defeat he got asked to do something he didn’t know how to do and just accepted he didn’t know but he’d figure it out. Fan of trial and error and tinkering never giving up. Tinkering your way through a situation not just thinking this is the way and it’s being right. All great successes come from repeated failures and organic. Kett hung around the sales people and realized sales was the key to growing any business great products are awesome but sales is key. Kett worked at national cash register which provided a good graduate school like experience. He was great at lateral thinking for technology he took cash register innovations and applied it to cars.
- Rapid Growth and Financing of Delco: How They Became Part of GM
  Key takeaways:
  - Delco, a company owned by Ket, experienced rapid growth and caught the attention of Billy Durant, leading to its acquisition by GM.
  - Delco had to transform into a manufacturer in order to build the electric starter, necessitating significant financing.
  - Delco grew from 12 to 1200 employees very quickly.
  - Ket and Deeds mortgaged their personal assets and borrowed money on their life insurance policies to finance Delco.
  - Delco also utilized patents, contracts, and advance payments from Cadillac, as well as the sale of preferred stock, to raise funds.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And so this one invention is where we see Ket's company, which is called Delco, have rapid growth. And eventually that rapid growth is noticed by Billy Durant and Billy Durant's going to buy it and that's how he's folded into GM, okay? We're not there yet. But I want to get to the point about, well first of all, Delco has to, I already said that they're going to turn, they have to turn into manufacturers, right? Or else the electric starter doesn't get built. So I thought it was interesting how they financed the company. It became necessary for Delco at the finance stage of this company, should say. It became necessary for Delco itself to set up the job of manufacturing a large part of the equipment. There were only 12 men on the payroll at the time. They grew from 12 men to 1200, very, very fast. But to get even that small endeavor under the, under way, Ket and Deeds had to put all the money they could, they could scrape up. They mortgaged everything they had. Deeds put a mortgage on his house and Ket put on a lot that he owned, put a mortgage on a lot that he owned. Both borrowed money on their life insurance policies. They also put up patents and contracts with Cadillac as collateral for a loan from the bank. Cadillac also paid them some money in advance. They're doing whatever they can, right? They sold some preferred stock and raised money in every possible way. ([Time 0:40:48](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f63f488d-a36e-4a07-a903-2169e71e69b5))
    - **Note:** Kett worked from light until dark with a great team. He mortgaged everything he owns to raise money for gid company. Kett always knew what he didn’t know and had someone run the business side of his endeavors. Kett saw air travel as the future and realized we always overestimate the world and what we understand and under appreciated the great unknown people thought trains were good enough Kett realized air travel was the future. An ounce of experimentation is worth a pound of theory. Intellegent ignorance is vital to doing anything great if you think it’s too hard you never try. Kett believed in seeing from the front. No one can get experience for you hed veer off the path often because there was a great lot we didn’t know and you couldn’t learn that by staying the course.
- I HATE COMMITTES + importance of DOING testing yourself!
  Key takeaways:
  - Ken hated committees because they were a waste of time and they didn't do anything useful.
  - It is important to get your own firsthand experience in order to develop new ideas.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  This is why Ken hates committees. He does a lot of work for the country in both World War I and World War II. So during World War I, the army or the military has an issue. There's this thing called knock. It happens in engines and cars, but it's also happening in engines and planes. And so through trial and error, he discovers, hey, gasoline, for whatever reason, gasoline that's produced in California causes the engine to knock less than gasoline that is used From that is created in Pennsylvania. So he tells them the result of his experiments, but they, the committees doesn't agree. That's what it says. It was accordingly suggested that California gasoline be used as fuel for airplanes flown in combat. But unfortunately, there was a wartime committee which turned down the recommendation. Recommendation is not practical. I think it's the definition of practical, actually. It was this frustrating experience and several others, which cuttering had with committees, acting on progressive ideas that caused him to say later. If you want to iron a thing down to the most simple, commonplace, low form of mediocrity, what a committee to pick the flaws in it. Why? Because there isn't one man in a thousand who has any imagination. When 10, now he's going to give a, this is a great story that illustrates his opinion on this matter. Ten years afterward, when his wife read about Charles Lindbergh's solo flight across the Atlantic, she said to her husband, how wonderful that he did it all alone. It would, and this is cat's reply to Larry's. It would have still been more wonderful if he had done it with a committee. And so, cat has this philosophy. I love this idea he says, and this is very similar to a lot of, like Henry Ford would say something similar. We find that in research, a certain amount of intelligent ignorance is essential to progress. For if you know too much, you won't try the thing. This is cat on the importance of first-hand experience. It may seem strange that with all his responsibilities and with as, as much capable of help as he had, cat would devote so much of his own time to road testing, meaning driving the automobile To make sure that what he fixed is actually fixed. It was done in the exercise of his belief that it is a mistake for any person engaged in research to leave the practicing of it, the practicing of it altogether to others. It takes personal practice to drive delusions out of a fellow's mind, he said, in an illustration of this belief he once told this story. I was running some tests off the coast of Florida in connection with automatic steering devices for small boats. And when the weather was bad, I used to work out there every day from about 9 in the morning to about 3 or 4 in the afternoon. The test had to be run in bad weather because we couldn't find out anything in good weather. Some friends of mine down there for a vacation said, we think you're crazy running that little boat up and down in the stormy golf stream all day long. Why don't you get somebody else to do that for you? One of those men happened to be a very good golfer and the other was an excellent violinist. So I said, I'll tell you what I'll do. You fellows get somebody to play your golf game for you and to practice your fiddle for you. If you find that works, let me know and I will get somebody to ride that boat for me. Right now I do not know how anybody else could get my first-hand experience for me. One of the fundamental principles of Cass life was the fact that he would, you know, he'd veer off the path. If you believe that there's more things that we don't know than we do know, then just traveling on a well-worn path is not the way to discover new things. And so what was interesting is he applied this even in his travel. So he's talking to this person. They both have to drive back from Dayton to Detroit quite a bit. And at the time, Route 25 was like the main highway to do so. And so, Kat tells him, you know, I can get there, whatever. I think it's like four. The guy says you couldn't make the drive in four hours. And Kat says, well, I do make it in four hours. And so he's like, all right, I'm going to ride with you next time you do this because I want to see how you do this because you're doing it so much faster. I'm so says often Kettering used this story to emphasize to young people and others the importance of getting off the beaten track, especially if one is to be successful in developing New things. Invention, he would say, is nothing more than getting off Route 25. So what this guy discovers is when he's riding with Kat, this guy would stay on Route 25 all the time. So it takes him, you know, six hours, seven hours, whatever it was. Ket discovered to trial and error that there's you get on and off Route 25 and you can get there faster. And so he uses that as an illustration. And it's like, okay, it's the same thing when you're trying to do new things. Kat was a master salesman, not because necessary he wanted to, even though it does have, you know, extreme practical uses in life. But because he understood that the hardest job in life is selling you ideas. ([Time 0:49:43](https://share.snipd.com/snip/bb0a29be-b0b6-4033-a73c-44fac1ca814d))
    - **Note:** The importance of avoiding commitees and seeing from the front.
- The importance of getting off the beaten track
  Key takeaways:
  - The importance of getting off the beaten track to be successful in developing new things
  - Invention is nothing more than getting off the familiar route
  - Trial and error can lead to finding faster ways to reach a destination
  - The importance of being a master salesman to sell your ideas
  - New ideas are the hardest things in the world to merchandise

  And at the time, Route 25 was like the main highway to do so. And so, Kat tells him, you know, I can get there, whatever. I think it's like four.

Kat was a master salesman, not because necessary he wanted to, even though it does have, you know, extreme practical uses in life. But because he understood that the hardest job in life is selling you ideas. One of Ket's important functions was that of selling the results of research to practical engineers and executives in the manufacturing divisions. That was seldom easy. Out of his experience, Ket had said that new ideas are the hardest things in the world to merchandise. This is hilarious. He's got a, he's very funny, actually. Concerning one man with whom he had to deal, one who made it an invariable practice ([Time 0:53:31](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5384c029-8568-4857-a4dd-3a048c9d756e))
    - **Note:** You need to get off the beaten path to learn and sell your new ideas. Kett would cultivate learning he wouldn’t take his book but prood ideas to launch and trigger others creativity. You often couldn’t tell his position just from talking with him. Cultivated and allowed for people who thinking differently. After you release something you encounter a big early hiccup most things fail here but everyone experiences this and true success comes from pushing through this. He believes in releasing products when they were ready and not making them perfect. When you release it you’ll feel more agency and learn more by having it in the real world. You need to try things and put yourself out there but action without intelligence is failure.
- The Price of Progress and Action
  Key takeaways:
  - Once a product is useful and better than what is currently available, it should be made accessible to people.
  - Making a product available sooner benefits users and supports faster and more intelligent product improvement.
  - Taking action is crucial, as intelligence without action is foolishness.
  - Troubles are to be expected when introducing new things; the price of progress is trouble.
  - Overconfidence can be dangerous, and finding the opposite of Kett would be Josiah Stamp.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  The answer is this. I have found that once a product has reached a stage at which it is useful to people, are better than what they have otherwise, it is time to begin making it available to them. Doing this serves two purposes. The first is that people get the benefit of the improvement sooner than they would otherwise. The second is that the further improvement of the product will proceed faster and more intelligently when there is such practical use to stimulate and guide it. This is the summary of this quote is really you must act, you must move. You have to try things, Kett says. Action without intelligence is a form of insanity. But intelligence without action is the greatest form of stupidity in the world. This is Kett on the price of progress. In putting on new things, troubles are not the exception. They are the rule. That is why I have said on many occasions that the price of progress is trouble. This section about the read-tuse, you could summarize it saying that over confidence can get you killed. Another way to think about this is this person is the, if you could find the opposite of Kett, it would be Josiah Stamp. ([Time 0:59:27](https://share.snipd.com/snip/51ea7fd6-fef0-42c2-98f4-8893c82dc89a))
    - **Note:** Trouble is the price of progress. Let the competition think your ideas are crazy work out the kinks and when you’re living in the future they’re tell trying to optimize and are behind. Don’t look for rest look for progress the only park benches are outside the undertakers office we must push progress. Humans don’t know that much and we this can’t plan new industries. The more education people have the less likely they are to invent and the more likely they are to avoid failure. Inventions need to embrace and learn how to fail intelligent. Humans know nothing thus we need to keep trying and failing. Running from discomfort is a disservice you need to run at difficulty. Grow through hardship. There is no use for timidity. He fights to own his ideas by doing the work then sticks by them. We are always at the beginning of our consciousness beginning of infinity.
