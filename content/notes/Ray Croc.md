### Highlights

- Each man makes his own happiness and is responsible for his own problems. A man must take advantage of any opportunity he sees come up. Saw milkshake machine called the multi mixer quit his job and went out on his own after working for 20 years. Heard people calling for multi mixers like the McDonald’s brothers had in California. Eventually he got so many of these he had to see what these guys were up to first hand. He was shocked they had 8 multi mixers churning at the same time. He learned about how they had a simple menu with simple ingredients and ray saw these stores all over the us. The brothers didn’t want to franchise they were happy with their one restaurant but ray wanted to think bigger and offered to franchise the concept. Despite being 52 and diabetic with a host of other problems ray was ready to go it at his own. He couldn’t square the McDonald’s brothers work ethic or lack thereof.

    - **Note:** Ray was high agency and quit his job of 20 years once he saw the multi mixer a better opportunity, then look to see what his customers were using it for saw from the front discovered the McDonald’s brothers saw the franchising opportunity and took it. He was an asshole, but super high agency and work ethic. No one is coming to save you you must save yourself
- Bias for action. Works very hard but work was play to him. He was working from 7-2 am every day but Sunday. This destroyed his relationships but he needed to work.
  It’s not what you do but how you do it. Ray was making 2% on the franchise but when he switched to owning the land he printed money.
  How reading and rereading change your. The books don’t change but your mental models do so you gain a deeper understanding of the words on the page.
  After years of doing many jobs including working at an illegal nightclub during prohibition that land him in jail he decided to focus on selling cups. Focused intensity leading to greatness.

    - **Note:** Ray just worked and worked didn’t compromise on anything so he had a terrible family life and was an asshole but got rich. Focused intensity in anything and deep understanding of the craft lead to greatness.
      Ray found the leverage point was in owning the land not franchise fees.
- His dad was money hungry and made a lot in the predepression real estate bubble but confused luck with skill and lost it all when his luck turned Don’t confuse luck with skill. His dad dies because of this stress.
  He decided to quit his old job and got seed capital from them to sell multi mixers. This ends up being a terrible deal and he mortgages his house to get out of it. His wife was very unhappy with all this behavior.
  10 years on and he realizes he’s in a shrinking business. He starts looking for other things and that’s when he meets the McDonald brothers. He makes a bad business deal with them but he thought he wanted to open McDonald’s to sell multi mixers and didn’t realize what it could become stand alone. Going all in on McDonald’s officially ends his marriage.

    - **Note:** Don’t confuse luck with skill and remain mentally flexible and opportunity focused.
      Don’t expect others to change and this is unique problem solving. He has constant drastic career changes in his goal to be successful
- The genius in McDonald’s was in its simplicity a few well executed ingredients.
  He’s driven persistent and ruthless and never claimed to be a good guy.
  He demanded perfection and would even mop in a nice suit yelling at people when even a tiny detail was wrong.
  He couldn’t get money based on his 1.4% contract so he bought the land leased it to operators came up with management procedures and plans. And generated float to reinvest in the business which catalyzed growth.
  You can only connect the dots looking back not forward. Ray went from cups to multi mixer to McDonald’s to the franchise concept. These were all emergent.
  He expected early workers to give it all missing kids birthdays ect. Then he fired these old guard people. He wasn’t a good person relentlessly business focused.
  Ray saw advertisement as an investment the McDonald’s brothers saw it as an expense.

    - **Note:** the power of simplicity was in the ingredients. He found the leverage point in the system was the land and simplified the processes. You can't connect the dots looking forward him selling cups led him to mcdonalds through the multi mixer the world is emergent.
      He was not a good person and had people sacrifice their lives then fire them when he used them up.
      Advertising is an investment not an expense
- Ray needed to get out of the contract with the McDonald brothers. He lined up financing with 12 pensions and investors for 2.7mm for the brothers contract of .5% of sales. They made 12mm. A small tax on a growing pie is still a lot. By the 70s that piece would be worth 15mm in cash flow a year.
  Ray had a religious faith in McDonald’s. God family McDonald’s but in the office those priorities were reversed. He had a religious zeal for the company.
  Failing to spend the money on advertising is failing to invest. His ad campaigns drive a ton of business.
  He believed in decentralized management if you don’t empower people to do what they want you lose your best people. Give people the room and ability to make mistakes.
  Nothing recedes like success. You need to be determined to be successful but once you gain success you lose this fire and it kills you. Nothing can take the place of persistence. Press on. Genius and talent get beat every day by persistence. Never stopped dreaming.

    - **Note:** Ray bet on himself and bought out the McDonalds brothers. He believed deeply in the business risking everything missionary zeal. He invested in advertising.

You need to be constantly determined to be successful. Persistence. Hard work beats talent and keep dreaming
