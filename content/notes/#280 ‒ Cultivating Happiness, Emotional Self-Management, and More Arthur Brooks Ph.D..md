### Highlights

- Feelings Are Not Happiness
  Summary:
  Happiness is a distinct concept separate from feelings, often misconceived as being one and the same.
  While feelings serve as evidence of happiness, they do not encapsulate its essence. Many individuals chase fleeting happy feelings, mistakenly believing these sensations represent true happiness.
  This pursuit can lead to dependency on external factors like sleep quality or relational dynamics, rather than fostering a genuine sense of happiness.
  Furthermore, happiness and unhappiness can coexist, with individuals experiencing both simultaneously, a notion supported by advancements in neuroscience.
  The brain processes emotions through the limbic system, highlighting four primary negative emotions—sadness, anger, fear, and disgust—that evolved to protect and inform us about our environment. For instance, fear and anger trigger immediate survival responses, while sadness signals social disconnection. Interestingly, humans uniquely engage with aversive emotions through controlled exposure, allowing them to find value in uncomfortable experiences, such as extreme sports or cold plunges. This ability to engage in metacognition enables better emotional regulation and a deeper understanding of one's mental states. Positive emotions include joy, stemming from achievement after effort, and interest, driven by the innate pleasure derived from learning and exploration.
  These emotional responses have evolutionary roots, emphasizing the importance of both understanding and navigating the complexity of emotions to achieve true happiness.

  Speaker 2
  There's a lot of stuff I want to talk about with you on this topic, but let's begin with a question, which is what's the difference between happiness, which is what you write about and Happy feelings. Are they the same thing?
  Speaker 1
  They're not. And this is a really important misconception. All of my students and most of us actually have, we live in the era of feelings. If you'd talked to my parents or God does my grandparents about feelings, they would scratch their head. What are you talking about? I mean, talking about your emotions all the time, ephemera, feelings seem so counterproductive. And in point of fact, our grandparents were right. Feelings are not happiness anymore than the smell of the turkey is your Thanksgiving dinner. Feelings are evidence of happiness. And that's incredibly good news. I mean, a lot of people think that happiness is a feeling. It's quite incorrect. There are many better technical definitions of happiness, but they produce a lot of feelings. They're associated with a lot of emotions, which is limbic system activity, a part of the brain, a 40 million year evolutionary process that developed the limbic system to create emotions. That signals information is what it comes from. If you mistake these feelings for the underlying phenomenon of happiness, you're going to be chasing it all over the place. You'll be chasing ghosts. How I slept last night, what I ate for breakfast, if my spouse yelled at me this morning, that's what's going to determine my happiness. You wind up being managed as opposed to having any prayer of managing your own happiness. So that's the first thing to keep in mind. It's not feelings.
  Speaker 2
  It's hard to differentiate, though. Having read this stuff several times, you have to remind yourself when you're in the throes of what I just refer to as negatively valenced feelings that this is not a statement of my overall State of happiness. Yeah, for sure. And then what's the relationship between unhappiness and happiness? Are they polar images?
  Speaker 1
  How do they coexist? Well, for the longest time, if you even go back to the ancient philosophers, there was the idea that happiness and unhappiness exist on the spectrum. So unhappiness would be the lack of happiness. We know a lot better now, given the explosion of neuroscience and the way that emotions are produced, that in fact, you can be happy and unhappy or have happy and unhappy feelings in parallel. So for example, the average person spends about 40% of their time with predominantly positive feelings. It sits in a neutral idol of positivity. Most people do not everybody. About 16 or 17% of the time the average person has predominantly negative feelings. Something is going on. That's more intense. Part of the reason is because negative emotions get your attention and they're supposed to. Evolution favors negative emotions. Positive emotions, nice to have. Negative emotions, pay attention because that could cost you your life.
  Speaker 2
  What are some of those, if you think about this evolutionarily and not even going back to millions of years ago, but just going back hundreds of thousands of years ago to the origin of Our species as homo sapiens, what do we think are some of the most powerful negative emotions that would drive action?
  Speaker 1
  There's basically six fundamental emotions or basic emotions. These are the building blocks of all emotional life that are produced by the limbic system of the brain, four negative and two positive. The four negative emotions are sadness, anger, fear and disgust. All four of those have a very strong evolutionary basis. Fear and anger of course have to do with threat. They involve the amygdala of the brain. You know, when a car is about to run you over in your pedestrian and a crosswalk, that crosses your visual cortex and is recorded in the occipital lobe of your brain as an enormous predator. That signals to your amygdala to send the signal through the hypothalamus of your brain to your pituitary glands, which signals your adrenal glands above your kidneys to spit out stress Hormones. That happens in 74 milliseconds. By that time you're sweating, your heart is pumping, you've jumped out of the way and you flipped off the driver, a combination of fear and anger in response to the enormous predator. Three seconds later, your prefrontal cortex catches up and you say, I shouldn't have flipped him off. That's not my values or whatever it happens to be. So that's your limbic system keeping you alive. That's fear and anger. Then of course there's disgust, which involves the insular cortex of the brain, also part of the limbic system. That's when you pull something out of the back of your fridge you forgot about a few weeks ago and you hold it and you're like, that signals don't eat it. And so anything that might carry a pathogen signals that basic negative emotion of disgust to you. Now it can be misattributed to people. That's what demagogic politicians always do. That's what the media does to us. It tries to reprogram the insular cortex, the insula of the limbic system of the brain so that when somebody disagrees with you politically, you look at them like a cockroach. That's what demagogic leaders and dictators have done for time immemorial so that people will undertake barbaric acts against people in their own countries, lisas of war, et cetera. And then last but not least is sadness. Sadness is also evolved. Sadness is what you feel largely in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex of the brain and another part of the limbic system. That's mental pain. Usually when you're either socially excluded or you're separated from a loved one. Now that's something that's evolved because you don't want to be separated from your tribe. You don't want to walk the frozen tundra and die alone. But what happens, for example, in grief, grief is un-remediated sadness. And the reason is because your brain is saying, make this separation go away and you can't just because of other person is permanently gone, aka dead or divorced or whatever it happens To be. And so the grief is just this pulsating activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex of the brain saying, I must be reunited with that person, but I can't be. And it takes a lot of time in many cases for the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex to stop registering that sadness that pain.
  Speaker 2
  The sadness we feel when a person dies, which would be the ultimate form of separation, is a more extreme version of say a social isolation that you might feel like what... ([Time 0:05:26](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a443431c-0707-494b-9a9c-3cf1175e6d51))
    - **Note:** Feelings aren’t happiness they’re evidence of happiness. 60% of feelings unhappy only 40% of feelings happy. Seperate feelings from emotional state. 4 negative emotions and 2 positive. There are 2 types of feelings in pain there’s there is sensory pain and affective pain. One actually hurts the other is your perception of pain. One you can control like extreme sports. This is why humans like spicy food this is how humans can dominant conditions. Hurts so good. Then the positive is joy and interest.
- Happiness vs. Evolutionary Imperatives
  Summary:
  Evolution prioritizes survival and gene propagation over individual happiness, challenging the assumption that happiness is favored by natural selection.
  While humans possess various desires, including those for joy, Mother Nature's focus is on reproductive success rather than emotional well-being. The presence of dark triad personalities indicates that unhappiness does not deter mating success, suggesting that happiness is not an evolved trait.
  Instead, the pursuit of happiness often requires resistance against evolutionary drives.
  Research into the heritability of happiness reveals that mood balance varies significantly among individuals, leading to distinct personality patterns regarding emotional experiences.
  These patterns include varying intensities of positive and negative emotions, resulting in four main classifications of emotional response within the population: the 'mad scientist' quadrant with intense emotions, the 'cheerleaders' with high positive and low negative emotions, the 'poets' characterizing those with high negative and low positive emotions, and 'judges' who maintain low levels of emotional intensity. This distribution highlights the complex interplay between genetics and emotional well-being.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  When you think about the arc of evolution, a purely Darwinian approach to our existence would be evolutionary fitness. Where does happiness fit into that?
  Speaker 1
  Now that's a question that I've dealt with or thought about for a long, long time. And a lot of people sort of assume that evolution would favor happiness. And the reason is basically this. Evolution gives me a bunch of desires. It gives me desires for calories and interesting things and sexual partners and all those things that evolution wires into me. And there are certain things that I want. And one of the things that I want is those things, but also I want to be a happy person. So therefore, evolution must favor happiness. That's wrong. There's no indication that Mother Nature cares about your happiness. She cares really about two things, survival and gene propagation. That's what Mother Nature wants you to survive and pass on your genes. You being happy? Does that help that? Maybe? Maybe not. Maybe it doesn't. I mean, we find that dark triad personalities, malignant narcissists, they tend to be way unhappier than normal and they're extremely sexually attractive to the opposite sex. What's up with that? People are finding terrible mates that make them miserable and they have extremely high levels of success in mating markets. And that militates against the idea that happiness would be evolved. And so I've become persuaded that happiness is sort of the divine path versus the animal path. And it's many times you need to stand up to Mother Nature's imperatives so that you can be happy. I give a lot of examples in my own research of actually how that's the case.
  Speaker 2
  Let's talk about a bit of them because in part where I want to be able to go with this is the heritability of happiness, which we know about. Let's talk about both of those things. What can we learn about the genetics of happiness and talk maybe a little bit about your research as well?
  Speaker 1
  The baseline levels of mood balance, which is not the same thing as happiness. It's the extent to which you feel positive and negative emotions or the course of the day varies a lot between individuals. There's sort of four personality patterns with respect to positive and negative emotions over the course of your day. And they have to do with the intensity and the frequency of negative and positive emotions. There are four equal sized groups.
  Speaker 2
  Yeah, let's talk about them. And I haven't taken the test yet, but I'm positive. I know which one I know you are too.
  Speaker 1
  So there are people who have extremely intense positive emotions and extremely intense negative emotions. Now it doesn't have to be extreme. In my case, it is. It has to be above average to be in a quadrant called the mad scientist quadrant. That's a quarter of the population. They're above average positive intensity in mood and above average negative. There are some and this is the one that everybody wants to be is above average positive and below average negative in intensity. These are the cheerleaders. There's a quarter of the population that's above average negative and below average positive. Those are the poets. And that's a really interesting from a neuroscientific perspective. These people, that's a quarter of the population as well. And then there's the low low. People are low affect people. People who have low intensity positive, low intensity negative. It doesn't mean they're not unhappy or happy. It means the intensity of their feelings puts them in that bottom quadrant. And those are the judges. Those are the unflappable people with enormously good judgment who don't get freaked out about anything.
  Speaker 2
  And this is roughly a quarter.
  Speaker 1
  It's actually by construction a quarter because it's above and below average across the population. So it has to be in those quarters. ([Time 0:17:32](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fcffa7b9-65d0-4b2c-b80b-b926655bb58e))

- Master Emotions, Don't Let Them Master You
  Summary:
  Effective self-management is crucial for maintaining emotional stability, especially for individuals characterized as 'mad scientists', who often experience heightened emotional states.
  Knowledge of emotional management techniques rooted in science facilitates better practices, allowing individuals to cultivate positive mental habits rather than succumb to emotional whims. Seeking constant highs can be detrimental, as stability—achieved through awareness and regulation of emotions—is essential for personal and professional well-being.
  Emotions should be experienced consciously through the prefrontal cortex, rather than impulsively driven by the limbic system, which governs emotional responses.
  The interplay between creativity and emotional states, particularly in individuals prone to depression, highlights the dual nature of strengths and weaknesses.
  This duality necessitates learning to manage emotional patterns, as they can hinder or enhance creative processes. Embracing metacognition fosters a proactive approach to understanding one's emotional landscape, enabling individuals to navigate their emotional complexities without destructive consequences. Ultimately, the journey towards emotional mastery calls for harnessing personal strengths while addressing associated weaknesses, guiding one towards a balanced, integrated existence.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  So what do you do with your knowledge base? So as a mad scientist, what are the tools you use from that to manage yourself, which is kind of a recurring theme here? We keep coming back to it and I want to come back to it more formally to talk about metacognition. But just briefly maybe one of the most important things that you think about as a mad scientist to regulate your own emotions and to presumably keep the balance more on the positive versus Negative valence.
  Speaker 1
  For the longest time, I mean, the reason I've done this research, Peter, is because I need it. This is me search. That's really what it is. And I know you do too. I mean, you do this work because you want to live a long time and have a high quality of life in our community of health and wellness and fitness and longevity. And we're all doing the best we can for our own lives and then sharing with other people. And this is absolutely the case with me. If you're a mad scientist and you don't self-manage, you're going to be all over the place. You're going to be a big mess. You're going to have difficult relationships. A lot of the time you're going to be miserable. And it's avoidable. It's actually unconstructive not to self-manage, but self-management is not one weird trick because they like to say on the internet. There's no hacks. It's really all about mental habits. It starts with the knowledge of the science. It goes into specific practices and then a lot of it has to do with teaching other people. As you know, the best way for you to live better is to teach other people how to live better. That's, you know, like, do you want to be healthy, start a health podcast or something and make sure you've got good science on your side? So when it comes to mad science, the mad scientist profile that's hard to manage otherwise, the mistake that people get into is they try to stay on the positive side.
  Speaker 2
  That's a logical thing to do.
  Speaker 1
  My polar disorder, we find that the biggest problem that they have is staying on their meds because they like the manic and they don't like the depression, but they can't time it. And so you actually have to stabilize your mood so that you're not seeking the highs and trying to avoid the lows. And by the way, I'm not saying that every mad scientist has bipolar disorder. I'm just saying that they tend to have mania. They tend to have this kind of a hyper manic as, you know, John Gardner talks about the hyper manic edge. And that's what most mad scientists have a little bit of. That's why they tend to make pretty good entrepreneurs like you, but they fall prey to a lot of mood issues that are pretty avoidable. At the pro level of self management in the mad scientist category is to not seek the highs because the highs don't help you that much, which you actually need to be as a full person, not Writing the wave of your emotions. You need to manage your emotions and never let them manage you. And that gets into the whole topic you're talking about, which is metacognition. That is to experience your emotions in your prefrontal cortex as opposed to living according to your limbic system. Never be managed by your limbic system. Your limbic system is nothing more than the factory for your emotions. That's really what it's doing. And if you're basically taking raw factory materials and trying to live according to them as opposed to assembling them, making them into a set of experiences, learning from them, Growing from them, you're not fully alive. You're subject to something. You're subject to a crazy machine all the time. And so that's a lot of what I write about is actually how do you experience emotions more fully in the pre-fall the cortex of your brain? What are the techniques for doing so? And when you're doing that, what is the repertoire of reactions and responses that you can bring to a highly volatile emotional state?
  Speaker 2
  Are there any folks where, for example, the poet, where you actually push them to be more in that limbic system or is it the same for everyone? Because the poet, of course, is the one who's disproportionately down, right? These are the great artists.
  Speaker 1
  So poets, there's interesting research that parallel to this that doesn't use the same pianist's test, but it's pretty provocative nonetheless. The people who have a tendency toward depression, not bipolar, but depression, they tend to be more creative. They're ruminators. And they also tend to be romantics. And this follows a pattern. You've met people like this that have this pattern of romantic, creative, depressive, poetic people. Really interesting neuroscience research suggests that there's a part of the brain that's especially active for these people. It's called a ventral lateral prefrontal cortex. And this is the part of the brain that you use a lot when you're ruminating on something, which depressive people do. They think about the thing and think about the thing. This is also what's going on when you're in love with somebody. You can't stop thinking. You're ruminating on another person. This is the same thing that's going on when you're working on a business plan or writing a symphony or actually writing a poem. So that's what they're really good at, but also what they're really bad at. They can't stop thinking about things, which is good for them and really bad for them. Their strength is their weakness. And Peter, this is the same thing across all the profiles. Your strength is your weakness. Your weakness is your strength. Learn to manage it. Wire to the strengths, remediate the weaknesses and complete yourself. So I encourage everybody to be more metacognitive, everybody so that you're a poet. You can be really, really poetic, but it won't ruin your life.
  Speaker 2
  Do we think that, and this is tangential and maybe not relevant, but do we think that the most extreme form of greatness that we've seen, the most genius type of phenomenon that we've Seen as a species always come from extremes in these categories?
  Speaker 1
  It's almost certainly not true.
  Speaker 2
  It's sort of a caricature of what we think to be true. ([Time 0:25:39](https://share.snipd.com/snip/dc2a86ef-8b40-485f-abbb-17e4a1c27e77))
    - **Note:** How to be a mad scientist are realizing your strengths are your weaknesses
- Pursue Enjoyment, Not Just Pleasure
  Summary:
  Attaining enjoyment satisfaction and meaning requires strategies beyond simply seeking pleasure, which can lead to addiction and temporary satisfaction.
  True enjoyment, engaging the prefrontal cortex, is derived from shared experiences and memories, particularly with loved ones, rather than solitary pleasure pursuits. Ads for products focus on social connections rather than individual indulgence for this reason.
  While some substances may provide transient pleasure, their effects are detrimental when pursued alone.
  Balanced patterns of social interaction, such as moderate drinking within a communal setting, can offer benefits distinct from the substances themselves.
  Ultimately, enjoyment is linked to meaningful interactions and memories, and prioritizing these can lead to a fulfilling life.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Enjoyment satisfaction and meaning. And you have to have strategies to understand why they're so hard to attain and what you need to do exercises to make sure that you can be better and more skillful at attaining each one.
  Speaker 2
  So let's start with enjoyment.
  Speaker 1
  It seems sort of straightforward. I want to enjoy my life. Get a lot of pleasure. That's wrong. Pleasure is limbic. Enjoyment involves the prefrontal cortex. Enjoyment is a much more complex phenomenon than pleasure. Pleasure is a signal for an olympic system that says this thing that you're doing will help you survive, usually through caloric needs or pass on your genes through something like sex. So that's what pleasure is really all about. There's nothing more. It's just like any positive emotion. It sends a signal saying do more of this. That's not the secret of happiness. That's incredibly evanescent. It's extremely temporary. And if you pursue pleasure, what you'll be doing is you'll be engaging systems in your brain, the dopamine system, for example, which is the anticipation of reward, the reward being Pleasure. You'll hit the lever, get the cookie, hit the lever, get the cookie. It will never last and you'll become an addict. Pleasure seeking. It would be phenomenon, the hippie motto of it feels good to do it is life ruining advice. It's just the dumbest thing ever. If it feels good to do it, you'd never go into the ice bath. I mean, you wouldn't stay married if it feels good to do it all the time. It's just terrible advice. So what do you need for enjoyment? The answer is the source of pleasure adding two things, people and memory. That's where you're engaging your prefrontal cortex. So anizer bush never runs ads for beer of a dude alone in his apartment pounding a 12 pack. They never do that, right? A lot of people use the product that way. Why don't they show that? Because that's the pursuit of pleasure and that's dangerous. That's bad for you. Use of methamphetamine is bad for you. What we're incredibly good at using science today is to take things that give a little bit of pleasure evolutionarily and supercharge them. People and dorphins that you get that will block pain under normal circumstances, we can supercharge them in a lab and make fentanyl and 100,000 people died last year. That pursuit of that pleasure is utterly ruinous. We look at a random series of events and when it's random, we get payoffs a little bit. We'll seek those events and that gives us a little bit of pleasure. We turn that into slot machines in Vegas and then you're sitting there at 4M by yourself. Really, really bad for you. That's the problem. Pouring pleasure alone, not making memory, will make you miserable. Usually, if something gets you a pleasure and you're doing it alone, you're usually doing it wrong. Pornography is a problem. It uses the sexual function in a way that leads to addiction and huge problems in people's lives. It's contraindicated. It's not good for especially young people to use that, but that's the same thing as fentanyl in this way. Okay. What do you do? You make sure you're with people, especially the people you love and you're making memories. That's why Anheuser-Busch's ads have two dudes or ten dudes or a family, cracking open a bud and drinking it and laughing. In the ad, they want you to associate the beer with happiness, which is enjoyment is the central factor, not the pleasure that the little bit of alcohol will bring you. That's what we need to do. That's the strategy.
  Speaker 2
  We're working on a, maybe by the time this podcast come out, it'll be out, but we're working on a very, very in-depth newsletter on basically the conflicting data on alcohol, specifically Around wine. Why is it that at a biochemical level, and certainly looking at the Mendelian randomizations, alcohol is toxic at any dose and it's a monotonically increasing function, so there's No amount of alcohol that is healthy. Yet the epidemiology is pretty significantly in favor of modest drinking over abstinence. Once you even strip out all of the obvious confounders that would lead to that, you're left with the phenomenon you describe, which is if you dig into the data really deeply, it's the Mediterranean drinking pattern that seems to be associated with some benefits at low doses.
  Speaker 1
  People in memory, not the alcohol per se.
  Speaker 2
  The food and the wine and the people combo that seems to be beneficial, not the vodka and red bull in the dorm issue.
  Speaker 1
  Even though it's the same molecule, it's a very different experience. Process sugar is the same thing. You find that people who eat candy one to three times a month on average live a year longer than people who abstain completely from candy. Candy's terrible for you. It rots your teeth, at least a metabolic syndrome. Eating candy one to three times a day is very different than eating it one to three times a month. And so the whole point is you do something that you enjoy, something that gives you a little bit of pleasure, which something really sweet does because of our evolution. Something that gives you a little bit of euphoria, like alcohol, makes you feel good, but you do it with people and you make a memory, unless all your friends are drunks, which is bad, You can get into a unhealthy community that you're doing it in a pretty moderate way. And then it's life enhancing despite the fact that it's a poison. And you can use a little bit of poison in a productive way, but it has to be about enjoyment never about pleasure per se.
  Speaker 2
  Such an interesting distinction.
  Speaker 1
  Man, I'm 59. It took me this long. This is information that I wish I had been able to use when I was in my 20s. It would have saved me a lot of grief. It really would have because all the time that I wasted with drinking, with just unproductive activity and the way that I missed opportunities to love and be loved and to have a happier Life. This is really, really news that people can use. ([Time 0:35:47](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0d27c49b-abb5-482e-8e9a-fe6fa17b41a7))
    - **Note:** Pleasure vs meaning enjoyment isn’t just pleasure macro nutrients of happiness and pleasure seeking doesn’t make us happy
- Satisfaction Struggles: Embrace Less to Achieve More
  Summary:
  Satisfaction arises from the joy experienced after overcoming struggles.
  This joy is deeply rooted in our biology and evolutionary psychology. However, the fleeting nature of satisfaction leads to misconceptions about lasting happiness, prompting individuals to pursue more in hopes of achieving perpetual satisfaction.
  The cycle of desires creates a 'hedonic treadmill,' where despite continual efforts to attain more, true contentment remains elusive.
  Recognizing this, the wisdom of Buddhism suggests that real satisfaction can be achieved by managing our attachments and desires.
  Using a 'want less' approach, individuals can cultivate fulfillment by focusing on what they have rather than endlessly chasing what they want. Instead of viewing life as a canvas with limitless additions, it should be seen as a sculpture that requires subtracting unnecessary elements. A practical exercise, such as creating a reverse bucket list that identifies and negates attachments, can help foster this mindset, allowing for greater freedom and lighter living.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Okay. So what is satisfaction then?
  Speaker 1
  Again, people are like, enjoyment is complicated and it's all complicated. That's why the knowledge is so critically important. I mean, that's why happiness is a serious business. Satisfaction is the joy after struggle. That's what satisfaction really is. As you struggled for it, you worked for it, you got it. It feels awesome. With my students cheat to get an A on my exam, there's no satisfaction. But if they worked really hard, you might say chump, stupid. Brooks probably gave the same exam last year. Go find Latchur's exam. But if they actually struggle for it and they study for it, they get a ton of satisfaction when they get an A because that's how we're wired. We're wired after you struggle for something a lot. Again, this comes back to the evolutionary psychology, even biology, is that you go looking hard for something and you get it, you want that to be reinforced as a good thing to do. That's why Mother Nature really wants that to happen and that's why we have that evolutionary imperative. Okay. So that's great. But here's this little twist that Mother Nature throws into it. If you knew that that satisfaction, that joy wasn't going to last, you'd think twice before going through the struggle. You'd think twice about the cost benefit analysis. Like if you said to yourself, I mean, like that watch, it's a nice watch. I don't know what kind of watch that is. It's a sea master or something, right? It's a GMT. It's a nice watch. But if you'd thought to yourself, it's a pretty expensive watch. I'm going to really, really like it for a week. You'd think twice about it. Trivial example, but there's all kinds of things that we do, that relationship, that conquest, that business plan, that feeling of blanks. I'm not going to enjoy it for very long. So Mother Nature shields you from that truth. You have to have it wear off quickly because you wouldn't be ready for the next thing. If you're a caveman and you're looking for calories and you find berries on a bush after a long hike, that's incredibly satisfying. That gives you a bunch of joy. But if you sat there enjoying them for the next week, you'd be a saber to tiger's dinner. You have to be ready for the next set of emotions. That's homeostasis. You go back to the baseline, physical baseline, emotional baseline. You always go back. But if you realize that, you won't make the effort in the first place. So Mother Nature tantalizes you with a joy that's going to come after the struggle and then veils the knowledge that you're not going to enjoy it forever. So people actually think, if I move to California, I'm going to be happy for the rest of my life because of the sunshine. I got the data. It's a few months. The taxes are forever. I mean, I see this constantly with people. My students, the reason they think they're going to be happier at 38th and 28th, which is generally not true. Generally your happiness is lower at 38th than it is at 28th. And lower at 48th than it was at 38th. The reason they don't know that, they get it exactly upside down is because they think that they're going to get things they want and they're going to be satisfied forever with them. When they get married, they'll be permanently happier.
  Speaker 2
  Have you been able to quantify the length of satisfaction, the duration of satisfaction when they get admitted to Harvard Business School?
  Speaker 1
  There are some studies on that and it shows that the satisfaction they get is usually a few weeks. So before they even matriculate? Oh yeah, for sure. So there's interesting studies that ask this question. When you get a bonus at your job, when do you enjoy it the most? When it hits your check or the day you find out? It's a question that answers itself. You go home because your boss says, you're the linchpin in this company. What a great job you're doing. 40% bonus. Boom. Dollars. You don't have the dollars, but you go home and open a bottle of champagne with your spouse. I earned it. It's great. Three weeks later, she goes up in your check and you're like, huh, yeah, good. Good. You're going to get up with that. But that's not where the real satisfaction happens because of the homeostasis. Now the fact that that surprises you, at least a deeply suboptimal behavior, if you keep getting surprised again and again and again and again, this satisfaction doesn't last, natural Conclusion is that you just needed more. It just wasn't enough. So go get more and more and more. And this leads to this chase, what we call it in my business, the hedonic treadmill that a lot of people know that expression at this point. Hedonic means feelings. The treadmill is you're running, running, running, and running to keep, maintain, and to get more of certain feelings. And you never figure out that you're on a treadmill and not making progress. The homeostasis is that you catch up immediately. You get ahead by two inches and immediately starts running you backwards. Unless you keep running, running, running, running, then you're going to be going the wrong direction and that's terrifying and terrible. So people not figuring out Mother Nature's cruel little hoax, they wind up on the hedonic treadmill of more and more and more and more and more have more. But why are we fooled by this? Because Mother Nature wants us to be fooled. I mean, we're born to be fools when it comes to this satisfaction problem.
  Speaker 2
  So this is actually one of the macronutrients where it seems that evolution is fully engaged. Clearly evolution favors pleasure over enjoyment, but evolution is all for satisfaction. All for satisfaction.
  Speaker 1
  And all for fooling you into believing this is the one that's going to be the eternal satisfaction. That is the animal path, absolutely. But there is a glitch in that matrix that we can exploit if we're willing to stand up to our natural impulses. This is where every philosophical and religious tradition comes in. Because most, I mean, life is suffering, according to the first noble truth of Buddhism. That doesn't mean life has to be suffering. It means life is naturally suffering. What the Buddhists are saying is that left to your devices, you're going to suffer. And the word for suffering in that first noble truth of Buddhism is mistranslated. The word in Sanskrit is dukkha. And dukkha actually means dissatisfaction. The first noble truth of Buddhism is that life is unsatisfying because of the hedonic treadmill, because of homeostasis. And how do you get beyond that? Well, you recognize that the reason for your dissatisfaction is the second truth is attachment. And the third noble truth is that you need to detach. And the fourth noble truth is the eightfold path, which is entirely contrary to nature. The eightfold path is not natural. That's why it's hard. So here's the way to think about it, just in sort of drive listener terms. Mother Nature says satisfaction will come and stay if you have more, more, more, what's your life strategy? More, more mone... ([Time 0:43:52](https://share.snipd.com/snip/543b5ae4-b57c-4968-9fb8-6d8629426076))
    - **Note:** Issues and solutions to satisfaction. Happiness is balancing haves and wants. Let go of opinions and attachments.
- Seek Clarity in Life's Essence
  Summary:
  A sense of meaning stems from three key components: coherence, purpose, and significance.
  Coherence refers to the belief that events happen for a reason, which fosters a sense of order amidst randomness. Purpose involves having a clear direction or 'north star' guiding one’s journey.
  Significance emphasizes the importance of each individual's existence and their impact on the world.
  To help identify whether one is experiencing a 'meaning crisis,' two diagnostic questions are proposed: 'Why are you alive?' and 'For what are you willing to die today?' Genuine answers to these questions, rather than socially acceptable ones, are crucial for personal introspection and growth.
  Engaging in self-reflection, meditation, reading, and seeking guidance can assist in discovering these profound answers, ultimately igniting the quest for a more meaningful life.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And everybody knows when they don't have a sense of meaning because their life is empty. They're the most miserable when they don't have a sense of meaning, but nobody knows exactly what it is. It's like I need this thing, but I know what it is. So philosophers and psychologists, by the way, define meaning is actually a combination of three things. Coherence, purpose and significance. Coherence is things happen for a reason. That's the first part of meaning. I believe that things happen for a particular reason. It doesn't mean my way is the right way and it might be randomness. My father was a PhD biostatistian, also very religious. And he used to say that the greatest miracle in the world was randomness, that God built the universe with randomness and regular distributions of events. He thought that miracles were extreme tail events in random distributions and God loved randomness. In other words, there's lots and lots of different ways to understand the coherence part, why things are coherent. The second is purpose, which is direction. Your life has direction. There's a word called the rum line, R H U M line. It's actually a much more common word in Spanish, a rumbo, and it's actually part of common parlance. A rumbo means the end point toward which your voyage is tending.
  Speaker 2
  You're not going to get there and you're going to vary from it, but you have to have a north star. You have to have something. You have to have something. Navigationally.
  Speaker 1
  And the last is significance. It would matter if I weren't alive. It would matter if I'm not here. So these are the component parts. Now, these are worth thinking about in detail in our lives. But here's the way I have a kind of a diagnostic test to see if somebody has a meaning crisis. And the reason this is useful is a two question exam. And if somebody doesn't have real answers, everybody's got PC answers, answers you give your mom or whatever. But if you don't have real answers to this, the good news is these are the two questions to go looking for answers to in your life. This is your vision quest is to find the answers to these by reading, by experiencing, by meditating, by spending time by yourself, by praying, by asking people's advice, by therapy. I don't know. Do your thing. Question number one is why are you alive? Why are you alive? You got to have an answer. It's not my answer. Your answer. A real answer. The question number two is for what are you willing to die today? Now you flunk this quiz by saying, I don't know. That's how you flunk the quiz. But then the adventure actually begins after you flunk the quiz because like I'm going to figure that out. I want to go find those answers. I'm going to read. I'm going to consider. I'm going to do all the things that you do metacognitively to find the answer to the questions.
  Speaker 2
  Let's think about that for a second. There are probably a lot of people who cannot answer one, who can answer two or who can answer one but can't answer two.
  Speaker 1
  I'm alive because of some biological process, etc, etc. But number two is I don't know what I'm willing to die for. ([Time 0:58:00](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6fc75668-2408-481f-8ec3-48e8b429fe7b))
    - **Note:** Meaning of life is the coherence purpose and significance. why are we alive? and what are we willing to die for today? Find the answers to these questions transcendence is admiring beautiful parts of nature and you feel small which gives you perspective and brings peace.
- Embrace Distancing for Clarity
  Summary:
  Experiencing emotions like sadness can simply be viewed as informative events rather than personal failures.
  Engaging in self-analysis fosters scientific detachment from one's feelings, which can be enhanced through practices such as prayer, allowing for a connection to a higher power. This approach affords individuals an opportunity to process their emotions consciously, ideally from the prefrontal cortex, where effective decision-making occurs.
  Alternatives like immersing oneself in nature or studying complex music compositions also serve to create a vital distance from emotional turmoil.
  Ultimately, it is crucial to manage one's emotional responses, with mindfulness practices being effective means to achieve this psychological separation.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Peter's feeling sad right now. How interesting that Peter is feeling sad. It's just information. Just information. Just analyzing information. Being a scientist about yourself. Prayer is really good for this. Why? Because you're bringing in a higher power to help you manage these things. And in so doing, you're experiencing them very consciously in the executive, the bumper of tissue right behind your forehead. That's where you wanted to reside. Some people do this through intensive exposure to nature, walking before dawn for an hour without devices. Some people will do this indirectly by studying the fugues of Johann Sebastian Bach and learning how to analyze them, whatever happens to be. One way or the other, you don't want the living system in charge. And then when you get this distance.
  Speaker 2
  So just be clear. You feel that this can be done without a mindfulness based meditation practice, which is clearly the potent exercise that one uses to distance self from thought. ([Time 1:10:40](https://share.snipd.com/snip/48037bfd-c683-4249-95af-e968d593ffa2))
    - **Note:** The first step in metacognition is giving yourself space to think either through therapy or meditation or journaling really anything. Anxiety is unfocused fear and meta cognition allows you to focus fear which allows it to go away. Keeps a failure journal then revisit the events in 30 days and 6 months to see the progress you’ve made. Learning loop. Happiness faith family friends and attitudes to work have changed which has all made us less happy. We’re less connected, and happiness comes from physical touch. Happiness isn’t a destination it’s a journey.
- Transcendence Through Discipline and Commitment
  Summary:
  Transcendence is not an inherent feeling experienced daily; it requires deliberate choices and the establishment of disciplined routines that prioritize creativity and spiritual well-being.
  Morning rituals, such as exercise and spiritual practices, set a tone for the day, facilitating focus and productivity despite feelings of reluctance. The act of love, whether in marriage or friendships, is similarly rooted in commitment rather than sentimentality; it involves a conscious decision to prioritize another's well-being over one's own immediate desires.
  This commitment transcends emotional fluctuations, embodying Thomas Aquinas's notion of willing the good of others.
  Happiness emerges not from fleeting feelings but from deliberate actions and choices that reflect one's values and responsibilities.
  Viewing life as a personal enterprise, akin to a startup, highlights the importance of leadership in one's health and happiness. True fulfillment and joy stem from applying discipline and commitment, enabling ongoing growth and transformation along a purposeful journey, rather than relying on momentary gratifications.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  This is an important thing to understand about transcendence. You don't feel transcendence all the time. You decide to experience transcendence and put yourself in the circumstances to experience awe. I'm sure you go outside and there's a lot on your mind. You've got a very busy and hectic and stressful life. And you don't feel it. You don't feel it every single day. Like I got a mask every day. I don't feel it every day.
  Speaker 2
  I wake up in atheists alive. And why do you do that?
  Speaker 1
  I do that because it was part of the protocol for living the life that I want to live. I mean, I get up at 445 like you. I work out for an hour, body. I go to mass, soul, then I work. That's when my creativity is highest. Now, of course, I'm also, you notice, I'm optimizing my dopamine. I'm sucking as much dopamine into my prefrontal cortex, which gives me creativity and focus for the three hours that I need to write. And that's a good motivation to do so. But I also want to optimize both body and soul at the very beginning of the day. So I'm centered on the things that really matter to me, notwithstanding how I feel. I wake up at 445 in the morning. I'm like, back day, I don't want to do back day. I don't want to leg day. I don't want to do that, but I do it. I do it. It's the discipline of the will that in and of itself is so important. And then I go to mass. I don't want to do it a lot of days. I don't want to do it, but that's not the point.
  Speaker 2
  Do you think that there is a deficit of that as well of that idea? So for example, you alluded to marriage earlier and anybody who's listening to this, who's married, especially who's been married for many, many years, they'll acknowledge that So much of the almost perverse joy of marriage is that you make a lot of sacrifices for another person and you find yourself putting someone else ahead of yourself. For me, that's a very hard thing to do. I'm just so hardwired to be such a selfish guy that it's really a wonderful practice to do something where I know, like, I'm going to make my wife's coffee today because she would do the Same for me.
  Speaker 1
  Well, part of that is that you have discovered and not enough people have that love is not a feeling either. Happy is not a feeling, but love isn't either. Love is a commitment. Martin Luther King, one time he gave this very beautiful sermon on the most transgressive passage in the Christian Bible, which is Matthew 544, love your enemies. And he says, Jesus says, today I give you a new teaching. You have heard that you should hate your enemies and love your friends. I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you. He says, Jesus doesn't say to like your enemies because that's a sentimental thing. The like is to feel. To love is to decide. This is what's going on between you and your wife. The satisfaction, the disciplining of your own will comes from the decision to love her. That's the magic. That's the magic in marriage. That's the magic in friendship. That's the magic that you can have in a relationship with your kids. Like if they were all about your feelings, hell, I'd be divorced. God knows my wife would bail on me. I'm just a pain being around me. She decides every day to love me. Thomas Aquinas, based on Aristotle, Aristotle talked really compellingly about love and friendship. Aquinas in 1265 raised the Sumithiologica, his magisterial contribution to philosophy. He introduced Aristotle to the West. Everybody was a Platonist, Till Aquinas. He defined love as to will the good of the other as other. When you're making your wife that cup of coffee notwithstanding your feelings, you're willing her good for her not you. That discipline of the will to love another person like that, that decision to do so, is completely transformative. That's transcendent to the day to day experience. The animal path is, I don't like to make coffee. I don't feel like it. The divine path is to love her, is to will her good as her. That's the human distinction. That's organized life.
  Speaker 2
  It really seems that that's almost a theme here of happiness. That happiness is much more about deliberate decision making, deliberate choices as opposed to reactive feelings, which that's obviously the extent to which we've discussed it. I think I like this thing that Oprah said, not happiness, but happiness. Happiness.
  Speaker 1
  The thing I like the most is she said it was, let's write a book, but totally. She said, let's spread this idea to a bunch of other people. I've been listening to your show for a long time. This is the salient theme. Take charge, man. Take charge. Don't leave your health up to what feels good right now. Take charge of it. I mean, you're the boss. The startup is you. You're the entrepreneur. The guy in charge of the enterprise. You're the CEO. Treat it as such. The CEO doesn't do what feels good all the time. The CEO does what's right, notwithstanding her, his feelings. That's the secret to happiness. It's treating your life like a startup. It's your philosophy of health and longevity is my philosophy of happiness because it's all one thing. When you talk about better, happier years or health span, I'm talking about happy span. That's what it comes down to. You're just not going to do it by doing what feels good in the moment. You're not going to discipline the will sufficiently to be able to make the decisions that lead you on this divine path that can give you this thing that you actually see. Is it perfect? No. Can you learn and grow and have progress all throughout the journey? Absolutely. Absolutely. ([Time 1:36:42](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0be7d6cd-13b5-4549-a832-2d14794f2ad3))
    - **Note:** Definition of love and loving your enemies. transcendence and doing things when you don’t want to. Discipline the will to stay on the divine path.
- Embrace Complexity to Discover Happiness
  Summary:
  Human problems can be categorized as complicated or complex.
  Complicated problems, though tricky, can be solved and replicated effectively. In contrast, complex problems, such as love and happiness, are inherently difficult to solve but easy to understand.
  Attempts to resolve complex issues with simplistic, complicated solutions—like technology—often lead to dissatisfaction.
  True happiness emerges from engaging fully with life's complexities, experiencing successes and failures, and receiving genuine feedback in relationships.
  Using relationships as a reflective tool can offer valuable insights into one's happiness, emphasizing the need for active participation in these complex human experiences.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And that's our proxy marker for the underlying construct, which is happiness. Here's the problem with that. Here's the fundamental problem. It's a different species of challenge. We talked about this one time before. There's two types of problems in human life. There's complicated problems and complex problems. And for those who didn't actually listen the last time that we did our show, you're sure together, the complicated problems are really, really tricky and take a lot of computational Horsepower and learning. But once you solve them, you can replicate the solution with effortless ease forever. You can do the biomarkers. Complex problems are incredibly easy to understand but impossible to solve. Impossible to solve. There are too many permutations of what can actually happen. So you like formula and racing. And so I'm going to set up this unbelievable. I'm going to take a bunch of Unix machines and I'm going to wire them together and I'm going to be 250,000 lines of code. And I'm going to simulate every F1 race for the rest of the year. You're like, you're an idiot. Why? Because F1 is complex. That's why it's interesting and you want to watch it. That's why it's so exciting to watch a formula one race because it's complex. I know what winning looks like. You crossed the finish line before the other guys. It's the simplest thing in the world. But a million different things can happen. A quadrillion things can actually happen. It's the fun of it. All of life's joys are complex problems. Most of the solutions that we get from technology and science are complicated solutions. The biggest problems that we have right now have to do with the fact that we want to solve our complex problems like love and we're trying to do it with complicated solutions like Instagram. A complicated solution to a complex problem will always leave you cold and make you worse off. Basically, I'm going to get rid of all the formula and races because it's dangerous. I'm going to have nothing more than computer simulations of it. It's like, that's the worst thing I've ever heard. That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. That's the key thing for us to understand. That's the reason I can't appize this. Happiness is a complex and adaptive human phenomenon. You can only get it by living it and working on it and making progress and failing. Just like your marriage. I just described your marriage.
  Speaker 2
  In that sense, at least I get feedback in my marriage because when I screw up and I apologize, I see that my wife forgives me. When I make a mistake, I feel the lenience and the love. When I need the help, the help is there. Indirectly, I'm getting really good feedback. Conversely, if a person was to take an honest assessment of their marriage and realize we're two ships passing and we don't fight but we don't have anything in common, if they were thoughtful Enough, they'd recognize things are not well. So they'd have a barometer there. Do you think that using others as a mirror is the best way to get the true barometer of happiness or do we rely on our own internal assessment? ([Time 1:42:52](https://share.snipd.com/snip/95be4b71-9a84-498e-a452-83b5d61d4fff))
    - **Note:** Complex problems are simple, but impossible to solve and complicated problems are very difficult to solve but once you have the solution it’s over and complex problems are the more interesting
- Measure Happiness with Multi-Dimensional Metrics
  Summary:
  Relying solely on a single metric for happiness is inadequate; a comprehensive approach is essential.
  Happiness can be assessed through three main dimensions: enjoyment, satisfaction, and meaning, which require deeper analysis. Utilizing a spreadsheet to track various 'micronutrients'—such as relationships, career fulfillment, and personal interests—allows for a nuanced evaluation of well-being.
  Regular assessments help identify areas needing improvement, mitigating the impact of short-term fluctuations in mood or events.
  Emphasizing a multi-dimensional framework enables better solutions to complex problems, fostering a structured path toward progressive growth in happiness.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  We wind up with our own internal assessment, but it's not good enough to have that be one single metric. How happy am I? We have three so far today in the conversation, levels of enjoyment, satisfaction, meaning we can know whether or not we have those things on the basis of the science that we've talked About and the ways that we can get better at and practice it. The techniques for getting more of those things are they family, friends and satisfying work. I break it down even further, by the way. I don't try to make it complicated, it's still complex, but I have a spreadsheet that I keep on my own happiness that the micronutrients behind the macronutrients, dozens of dimensions, And I'm rating myself, I weight those things according to my experience of how they feed into the macronutrients, and then I have scores on those dimensions and I want to make progress Every year. I do it on my birthday and half birthday, my half birthday is coming up in November, November 21st my half birthday, and I'm going to fill out my spreadsheet and say, I'm not on pace to get The progress that I had in my strategic plan for my happiness for next May when my birthday comes around again. What are the things I need to actually touch up? What am I doing? I'm kind of doing a curve fit to the complex problem I'm trying to solve with a little bit of a complicated solution. I give all those dimensions to my students and I say, look, do the reading, do the work. I've read 10,000 articles about this so you don't have to, but I do try to break it down a little bit so that I can have a multi-dimensional problem. One of the things that we know with complex problems is the more multi-dimensionally you make it, the more likely you are to get better solutions. The worst thing that you can do is like, how do I feel today?
  Speaker 2
  You're not going to make progress into those circumstances. What are some of the micronutrients that go into this for you?
  Speaker 1
  It'll be the warmth of my marriage, the relationship with my kids, how well things are going with respect to the value I'm trying to create with my career, the stability that I have in My friendships, the degree to which I feel like I'm properly philanthropic, the interest I'm taking in my professional life, the closeness that I have with certain intimates in my Life, the extent to which I'm avoiding or finding conflict in my work relationships, all these things that go into my spreadsheet. I know that they really matter across these three dimensions, the extent to which I'm enjoying my life of the course of each day. I do these particular ratings and then I put them together with a weighted sum across them and I've messed with a weighted sum and I've messed with it and experimented with it until I said, Yep, that seems about right, that seems about right with respect to what I'm experiencing at this point in my life. You make it a multi-dimensional problem. This is a huge body of social science that talked about imperfect linear models where you take big problems and make them into a bunch of little tiny problems and that curve fits to the Complex thing you're trying to solve.
  Speaker 2
  You evaluate that twice a year and therefore you can't have it be dependent on the technical noise of the day or the week. You're trying to answer these questions through the lens of the last half of the year.
  Speaker 1
  If I'm having a big conflict with my wife on my birthday, I don't do it that day. I don't do it that way because I don't want the noise is what it comes down to. If something really, really great happens to me, the book is doing great. I don't answer it that day either because I don't want my neurochemistry to be affecting it unduly. Although at this point in my life, I've been doing it for 25 years. I'm pretty cold and calculating.
  Speaker 2
  I think that would be a reasonable app to start with.
  Speaker 1
  Could be. Could be. That's very different than the biomarkers for sure because I don't actually know what you would look at. What are the biomarkers? I want to make sure I don't have a problem with my cortisol. I want to make sure that my hormones are balanced. I want to make sure that my adrenal system is not.
  Speaker 2
  Oh, yeah, yeah. But when I went biomarkers. I was talking about it. Yeah, no, no, no. ([Time 1:45:40](https://share.snipd.com/snip/99a57d41-29f5-46b1-9c36-47a85317f6af))
    - **Note:** Measuring the macro and micro nutrients of your happiness and making it a multidimensional problem so you’re clear if you’re on the right track in your life and following what’s important. Do an internal assessment of happiness
- Balance the Eye Self and Me Self
  Summary:
  The distinction between the 'eye self' and 'me self' is crucial for understanding one’s place in the world.
  The 'eye self' involves observation and awareness of the external environment, while the 'me self' focuses on self-reflection and social perception. An imbalance, heavily favoring the 'me self', can lead to discontent, especially in a society consumed by social media and self-image.
  To increase happiness, individuals should minimize self-reflection and external validation, reducing exposure to mirrors and social media notifications.
  Engaging more with the world and less with self-obsession can enhance overall well-being and fulfillment.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  William James talked about the eyesight self versus the me self. You must have both. When you're looking in the mirror, you're two people. You're the looker and the looky. And you need both because you need to be able to look to understand what's going on around you, but you need to have a reflection of yourself to understand who you are. I need to see, but I need to be seen by me so I can understand my context. I can understand my place in the world. If you don't do that, you'll get run over by a car. If you don't have the eye self or you'll have somebody kill you because you've offended them repeatedly because you don't understand the me self is the way that this works out. The problem is in our society, it's all me self. No, I self. Most people are not observing the world very much at all. They're being observed and they're observing themselves. They're trying to be observed and they're observing themselves. So social media is a classic case of this. Seeing your notifications is nothing more than a me self obsession. What are they saying about me? What kind of impact am I having out of the people? I get it why we do it. We're evolved to one understand where we are in the hierarchy. Social comparison, even envy, are evolved phenomena because it helps keep us alive and make progress. But it's misery when it takes over and when technology supercharges our ability to be in the me self state. There are moments when you can be really confused about the eye self and the me self. Sometimes I was really thinking deeply about something and I was kind of obsessed. My daughter and I were in the car and I put gas in my car and I filled up the car with gas. Took off from the gas station and I'm just kind of lost in thought. And about a block later, I heard this weird thing getting getting getting getting getting getting. Like, what's going on? Somebody's dragging a muffler and then I'm like looking for somebody's dragging a muffler around me. And then I noticed that cars are honking at me and pointing at me and like, what the hell? So I stopped the car. It turns out I hadn't pulled the hose out of the car out of the pump and I was dragging the gas pump down the road, right? And I had to go back to the gas station. I found out how happy they are when you do that, which is not and how expensive it is when you have to replace part of a gas pump. It was pretty bad. But the whole point was I was the eye self and the me self all at once and it was this weird, disequilibrating experience. One of the ways to get much happier is to be more in the eye self and less in the me self state is to minimize the reflection. It's to think a lot less of what other people are thinking and to observe yourself a lot less. And there are different ways to do that. So in the book I talk about this guy I work with pretty closely who he was a fitness influencer and a fitness model. I mean, imagine that. I mean, you're living by your abs. What a way to live. If you're seeing lower abs and you're an adult, that means you're never eating anything you like ever and you're not getting enough enjoyment of your life. And he was miserable for 10 years. He didn't eat what he liked. He always had headaches. He didn't feel good. He didn't have normal relationships. And so he decided he had to make a change in his life. It wasn't living. So he literally got rid of every mirror in his apartment and showered in the dark for a year so he couldn't see his own abs and his life completely changed just on the basis of getting rid Of those mirrors. When people are miserable in my classes, I say take off number one, take the notifications off your social media, turn off the notifications so you're not getting notifications. Don't look at your mentions. Under any circumstances, don't pay attention to that. And then actually literally start getting rid of some of your mirrors, your literal mirrors. And what you'll do is you'll get into more of a state of looking outward. And the more you look outward, the happier you'll be. The better off your life will be when you're walking around going, man, that's amazing. You know what's not amazing? Me. Indeed.
  Speaker 2
  Arthur, what surprised you the most when you set out to write this? You're writing a book on a topic that you've studied for decades. ([Time 1:50:22](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ed0b360f-4120-4608-b903-26d2cfa45a7e))
    - **Note:** The i self versus the me self. The i Self looks at the world and sees the reflective beauty of it, but the me self is very relational leading to problems like checking social media or comparison when we can just embrace the amazingness of the world.
