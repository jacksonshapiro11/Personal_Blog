### Highlights

- Embrace criticism expose yourself to a range of ideas. Think about who you can’t listen to and why are they judging tell bad stories or are they just not important to you. Understanding your listening motives can say more about you than others. People change and your view is people change when you listen
  The best communicators are the best listeners who know what the audience wants most and tailors the conversation that way. The stories you tell and the way to tell them depend on your audience. You should read others reactions as you speak listen as you speak and then ask them if they enjoy the topic or want to move on. We can be taught about being wrong but we can never be wrong about what we like and dislike

- In conversation we expect true information quality 2 we expect the information to be not too much and not too little quantity and that we don’t already know 3 we expect relevant information 4 we expect reasonably brief and orderly presentation
  People who feel the need to brag are insecure people regret speaking vs listening. So listen more speak less
  Listening to gossip and shared stories build trust with people. When you meet someone you’ll slowly scale up what you tell them from most open to most secret
  When you can’t talk you listen more and don’t think about you’re next point
  Listen to people embrace silence and thought for others. Don’t jump in too quickly allow for silence to fill the air. By remaining silent you learn more than talking
  Left ear non dominant is the emotional ear while the right ear or dominant is the logic ear
