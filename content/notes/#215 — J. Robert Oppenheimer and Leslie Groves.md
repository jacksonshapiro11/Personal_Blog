### Highlights

- Elon Musk's Inspirational Reading Habits and the Power of Biographies
  Summary:
  Elon Musk finds value in biographies and autobiographies rather than general business books because he believes they provide helpful insights.
  Musk was inspired by Benjamin Franklin's autobiography, appreciating how Franklin started from nothing, built a printing business, and excelled in science and politics. Musk admires remarkable people whose lives are documented in books and believes in studying their achievements for personal growth.
  Musk emphasizes that successful individuals often read biographies, apply the ideas of great people to their work, and discuss their reading habits.
  By learning from the experiences of extraordinary individuals, Musk highlights the importance of drawing inspiration from biographies for personal and professional development.

  Did that by recruiting scientists and engineers, inspiring them, and under Groves' supervision, leading them in creating the new bomb. In Groves, Robert Oppenheimer found the man who would reinvigorate his career and give direction to his life. Groves did that by giving him an unimaginably grand scientific and engineering task, along with virtually unlimited resources. Hundreds of thousands of people in research laboratories and plants across the United States helped to create the atomic bomb. But the successful development of this weapon, in record time, is in no small part due to the complex, sometimes tense, but always productive partnership between Groves and Oppenheimer. That was an excerpt from the book that we talked about today, which is The General and the Genius, Groves and Oppenheimer, the unlikely partnership that built the atom bomb, and it was Written by James Kanekka. So before I jump into the book, let me tell you how this connects with everything else that you and I have been learning and how I came to discover this book. So there is something that I discovered in reading a bunch of biographies of Steve Jobs, a trait that he had that I think is a good idea to copy. And that's to learn from every experience he had, figure out the underlying principle of that experience and then apply that to his work. So for example, he's a young boy, his father was a meticulous craftsman, saw his father build cabinets, build fences, and he would ([Time 0:00:44](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2e174c0f-84f0-4b60-aa26-e8eebd803605))
    - **Note:** Learn from every experience learn the underlying principle of that experience the Meta lesson. This project collected and leveraged the best prople to build something incredible the bomb. Team of a players in war time. General groves made massive altering decisions and was accustomed to making and living with them. He never would relinquish his role in doing this. Never passing responsibility. Groves built the bomb and pentagon. Formidable individual. Groves was a task master who would put his workers to the screws in everything he did he pushed people to do their best and was definitely a hard ass. He demanded excellence very high standards. He didn’t believe in praising for a job well done as everything could always be better. He works people very hard and pushed them to their limits. He was egotistical airways knew he was right and pushed people to work as hard or harder than him but every country tried to build a bomb and only he succeeded. Groves too over the project from Marshall. Marshall couldn’t push the project at the speed needed. Jordan they were deceiving themselves about what the gane required. Nobody thought it would suceeed and he didn’t want the job but once he got it he realized it would define his career.
- Working with General Groves on the Manhattan Project
  Summary:
  General Groves admired spirit and independence in his team, delegating tasks but holding high standards.
  His style involved criticizing projects at every stage, never praising a job well done. Despite his gruff demeanor, his subordinates like Colonel Nichols recognized the results he achieved.
  The Manhattan Project was initiated due to intelligence reports of German nuclear weapon development in 1939, preceding America's entry into World War II, with multiple countries striving towards the same goal.

  Fission projects could be conducted and coordinated. And that is exactly what they're going to build at Los Alamos in New Mexico. What was interesting too, to think about this, is when the announcement is made that Groves chooses Oppenheimer. Even though everybody around Oppenheimer thinks he's brilliant, he didn't have any administrative experience, didn't have any experience managing anything. And so they're quite surprised. Let me just pull out a couple quotes here. These are people that had worked with them. The names are relevant. This guy didn't think Oppenheimer was the most obvious candidate. He had no experience directing a large organization. One of Oppenheimer's closest colleagues found it in an almost improbable appointment. I was astonished Groves thought otherwise. Shortly after the war, he told an interviewer about Oppenheimer. He's a genius, a real genius. Oppenheimer can talk to you about anything that you bring up. He looks right through you. I feel like he can read my mind. So a lot of the people that knew Oppenheimer at the time, they're like, yes, he's the smartest of the smart that you could possibly find. But they didn't particularly think that he could be an effective leader in his own career at the time, which is also going to lead into why Oppenheimer desperately wanted this. It was kind of like middling. He's one of these people that you might have run into your life with. They're way too smart, that are really, really smart, but they have yet to achieve any kind of remarkable achievement to match up with their intelligence. I guess it's a way to ([Time 0:15:59](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0752eb28-1f87-44fa-851a-f74ee800e14c))
    - **Note:** Oppenheimer was incredibly smart and practical but hadn’t achieved anything of note his career was kinda floundering. People were shocked he got the opportunity given his lack of admin experience. Oppenheimer was 40 he hasn’t really done anything of consequence despite being a genius. They were fighting the Germans and they thought they were under threat of all our nuclear extermination needed a full speed all out attempt. Groves was rude with everyone but evenhanded with Oppenheimer even light because he knew how deep his commitment was. They went from nothing to bomb in 27 months. They also had to convince people to move to the desert give up on their research and commit with little vacation or rest. He needed to sell the mission. Finding talent was the most important and hardest thing that made the difference between their success and everyone else’s failure.
- Recruiting for Los Alamos: A Complex Task
  Summary:
  Recruiting for Los Alamos was a challenging task as Oppenheimer needed to attract highly talented individuals to the remote desert location.
  He faced difficulties in convincing top talents to join him in the middle of nowhere for a military project during the war. Oppenheimer framed the invitation as a scientific adventure and act of patriotism to overcome objections.
  His strong communication skills played a crucial role in convincing and collaborating with his scientific colleagues.
  The successful completion of the project was attributed to the partnership and mutual dependency between Oppenheimer and Groves.

  A pattern of assisting, mentoring, and gently prodding his director. And it's interesting, which has popped to my mind too, is because they talk about this later in the book, but Groves, like even at this stage, is obvious. We can't do this, we're just a hundred people in a few buildings. And you hear of other plans. I think there was one group in the Soviet Union that were trying to do this at the same time, and they had to do, they had put like resources of like 20 people. It was like laughably small when you figure that not just the laboratory in Los Alamos, but all over the country. There's all these spread out like research laboratories that are helping, and then the production of materials, it gets over a hundred thousand people needed. The idea, you think you could go 20 people at as laughable, but this idea where we can learn a lot from Groves management style, there is a book I did a long time ago. It's about the most influential retail of all time because his ideas were used by people like Jeff Bezos, Sam Walton, Jim Synego, his name is Soul Price. And he said something in that book that was fascinating. And he says, you train an animal, you teach a human. And I really feel that's what Groves was doing. He's teaching Oppenheimer how to manage. There's also a great quote in that same book because Jim Synego, the founder of Costco, was a soul price was his mentor. And he says in that book, he's like, somebody asked him a question one time, he's like, oh, you must have learned a lot from Soul Price. He's like, no, no, I learned everything. Everything I know. I learned from Soul Price. And he used the lessons he learned to build Costco. And so he echoes what his mentor, Soul ([Time 0:27:01](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2cf17686-8e29-43be-98c1-8e916fa1a2eb))
    - **Note:** The recruitment was difficult and constantly groves was coaching Oppenheimer on management. If you’re not spending 90% of the time teaching you’re not doing your job. There is managing by understanding the big picture or mastering details jobs and groves/Oppenheimer did both. The only way you develop your people is you spend a ton of time teaching them what’s important so they know you. To atttact their best talent you need to give them an opportunity other people can’t Elon did this at SpaceX. Everyone knew they could be part of history and this was the attractor. Groves worked relentlessly at full speed and hated how lazy other people were he scorned them. He new every day mattered and if you could save even a day you needed to report that. Groves was blunt forceful really smart hired only a players clear organization structure hated stupidity and sloppiness and was open to criticism. He treated Oppenheimer with respect and deffetence.
