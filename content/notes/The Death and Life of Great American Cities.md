### Highlights

- Think about processes and think inductively from the small to the large. And think about particulars and take small microcosms which will then generalize to the larger system. Top down management of complex systems is very hard so you need to start bottom up to have a chance at solving them with any accuraxyv
    - **Tags:** #system-construction, #seeing-from-the-front, #systems-thinking, #bottoms-up-not-top-down
    - **Note:** Understanding the system bottom up is better for the system development than top down. Understand the incentives and how things really are not how they should be.
- 3 problems simplicity ie how one motion effects another. Disorganized complexity measuring systems with statistical measures based on many variables not just 1 or 2 at large numbers the average system behavior becomes directionally predictable. Organized complexity moderate numbers of variables that are interrelated. Complex system with path dependenancy. Important to label the problem and understand it correctly so you can apply the correct mental models from similar tasks. Replaced the problem so it was easier. Assumed a city was just numbers not about the complex human interrelationships that exist in cities. If you can’t even recognize the problem there is no hope of a solution.
- Sometimes You need to realize that destroying things and rebuilding from scratch with a high level idea instead of building organic communities is the way to go. Things exist for a reason chestertons fence

    - **Note:** Before you get rid of something understand why it exists
- Slums are misunderstood they don’t need to be knocked down they just need to grow abs develop
    - **Tags:** #systems-thinking, #system-construction, #leverage-points, #system-vs-point-change, #negative-externalities
    - **Note:** Systems must be understood. Negative extranalities of systems are a result of the system and knocking them down doesn’t change the cause that perpetuated them.
- Lending wants quick profits not slow build up but Rome and communities weren’t built in a day but slums need investment to grow. It’s easy to blame others but we all share the blame for these issues

    - **Note:** It’s easy to think short term but true creation must happen over a dedicated focus over a long time horizon. Planting trees.
- Boarders are not specific to one group or area so it just becomes no group taking ownership with no one taking ownership the area falls apart. Ownership and community are important in a city (complex system)

    - **Note:** When everyone owns something no one owns something. Boarders are a tragedy of the commons issue where no one owns it so it degrades
- Strong city has strong diversity. When people want to move to nice areas it hurts diversity and the long term prospects of the area decline. People try to pile into hot areas but they are the reason they hurt the diversity and area

    - **Note:** Cities thrive because they are complex systems with a ton of diversity and areas contract due to homogeneity. Cultivate diversity and complexity as this is key to a system.
      Diversity leads to self organization and emergence cultivate it.
- Cities thrive when there is more diversity so more specialization and there is more opportunities for invention abs growth. More people more specialization more progress and progress compounds as ideas will move faster too. There are many inputs needed to make cities in neighborhoods successful but missing one can make them capitulate. Initial state of the system and path dependence.
    - **Tags:** #diversity-(within-systems), #path-dependence, #network-effects, #initial-conditions, #compounding
    - **Note:** Diversity in systems importance of compounding growth and having the right initial conditions and path to create a successful system. Construction of a complex adaptive system. Hierarchy self organization and resilience all helped by diversity.
- Good mix of old abs mew buildings can decrease barriers to entry and lead to more diversity in a system. Lower barriers to entry more interactions better system. Likewise if there is no new investment then it can’t grow so you need a healthy mix of strong investment and low barriers to entry.

    - **Note:** Lowering the barriers to entry increases the nodes and interactions in the system and creates a more diverse and robust ecosystem. Increase self organizing properties through diversity.
- I’m a dynamic system like a city you want to maximize the interactions
    - **Tags:** #complex-adaptive-systems, #increase-learning-rate
    - **Note:** Increase learning rate in systems.
- There are benefits to scale in cities that scale exponentially as size increases especially to support new and small business
    - **Tags:** #scale
- When the choice is sharing much or Shari g nothing people will opt for nothing unless you have a strong community. Sidewalk contacts are the small chains fr where the city’s culture and safety grows

    - **Note:** The small emergent public spaces in cities come to define them while the crafted top down areas often become overrun by negative externalities. You want to create community which is very hard and must be fostered organically.
- The streets of city are its life blood. When people talk about safety they first think on the streets. People’s ability to be safe and protect sidewalks is the mark of a good neighborhood and city. The sidewalk and the people on them create an organic community that protects the streets. A bar to keep people around can grant as much community as a schoolboys house

    - **Note:** The streets are the commons of a complex ecosystem. They’re vital for any functioning ecosystem and provide an almost anti tragedy of the commons a benefit of shared space for community formation. Diversity and community. Increase the velocity of interaction for a better community.
- The practitioners don’t look in the right places and don’t understand the problem they do what makes sense but their intervention is doing all harm and no good. When these people get conflicting evidence they do not shrug it off but just neglect it. They learn and think what ought to work without caring what does. Look at the world with an open mind. This is just a culture of people who though they knew what would work decided that it did work and despite their answer being completely wrong they held steadfast. They called organic complex fractal cities slums because it didn’t fit into the box that was supposed to work and they never questioned their box

    - **Note:** This is the theory induced blindness and bias of practitioners who see anomalies as just that and reject it instead of remaining open minded and looking for deeper truth. They think they know how the world works so they don’t care to really think. Take feedback from reality.
- Everything is a dynamic complex system in cities. Debating cities declining economies and social troubles travel together
