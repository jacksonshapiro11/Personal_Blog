### Highlights

- Knowledge is complexity that extends across universes Free will you choose a path in a cause and effect infinite version of spacetime both path exists and the results exist in space time as well some copies on the multiverse choose one thing others the other thing Each of the 4 strands are narrow and have gaps but taken as a grand unifying theory explain a lot about the world
    - **Tags:** #multiverse, #free-will, #structural-knowledge, #knowledge-gain, #probabilitic-thinking, #definitions, #favorite, #motivation, #writing-topics
    - **Note:** Knowledge is like structure across the multiverse. When we make a decision we step into a deterministic point in the multiverse but we have free will to traverse within the infinitely possible universe
      Each choice puts us in a deterministic multiversal point but we can choose which point
- Time is a set of parallel continuous space times and time travel causes a disparity between the interval in between two snap shots and our own experience between these 2 snap shots like a clock in time travel we are going from one universe to another to go in the past we need to travel into similarly connected universes traveling from one universe to another when you go back in time you need a multiverse for time travel time travel follows from general relativity people dint take it literally even though they probably should because it follows from theory Knowledge comes in the world through creativity and then goes through an evolutionary and error correcting process until it is fully formed start with problem criticism new theories ect. We can go to any other universe to go back in time
- Time is a continuum not a past present and future now is relative and there is the current moment and the past history up to that momrnt because observers moving at different speeds do not observe moments the same we need to consider time as a 4 D space time as the observed moments are the same but how they’re viewed is differently there is discrete moments and change through space time. All moments are fixed there is no free will or determinism the past is as fixed as the future other times are just special cases from other other universes ie hypothetical scenarios happen somewhere in the multiverse and we can judge their outcome relative to our universe or the entire multiverse for the likelihood/ effect of that event other times can both be in our universe or in other universes in the multiverse it doesn’t matter we have split other times in our observable universe with other universes wholistically but we realize these two are very similar near identical Cause and effect exists because you can check how much an event occurred in the multiverse based on another event occurring and see if there is any correlation when you flip a coin the future is known but not to any one person so each person in their own universe doesn’t know the outcome but across the multiverse we can understand what will happen. One person flips a coin and then 2 types of universes form the outcome once it is in the past is single valued for all observers but is still 2 valued in the multiverse Time is not a sequence of moments nor does it flow Our understanding is broadly true certain things have cause and effect relationships relative to an observer the future is uncertain and the past fixed we exist in multiple versions of things we call moments physical laws link all these moments with none more real than any other Time does not flow other times are just special cases of other universes

    - **Note:** Time is a bunch of discrete moments we observe it back to front but it's really not that. All events are fixed in the multiverse but our choices in the moment give us free will to occupy different emergent areas of the multiverse. Cause and effect exist and we have free will even within a fixed multiverse. The world is a bunch of infinite slices and all exist you cant create a new one past present or future but you can occupy different areas in different places in the multiverse. There is a chance we are in any of the bounded probabilities so it’s up to us to be where we want.
- A set of rules that always proved true things and never false things and prove them consistent. Goedels incompleteness theorems says and proof that validates arithmetic couldn’t validate itself tsp there is no hope of finding probably consistent rules if something is consistent there must be some method of valid proofs that the rules fail to designate as valid he took a set of rules proved that an inference couldn’t be proved or disproved under those rules From Wikipedia on incompleteness theorem. The first incompleteness theorem states that no consistent system of axioms whose theorems can be listed by an effective procedure (i.e., an algorithm) is capable of proving all truths about the arithmetic of natural numbers. For any such consistent formal system, there will always be statements about natural numbers that are true, but that are unprovable within the system. The second incompleteness theorem, an extension of the first, shows that the system cannot demonstrate its own consistency. Relationships of abstract entities are defined by themselves math studies core truths Necessary truth is the subject not the result of mathematics we just need mathematical explanations some of our knowledge is reliable but nothing perfect Mathematical entities are abstract and exist objectively but are not a higher truth or above other subjects Proof start with premise get to conclusions through inference vs a computation that models the abstract properties of some entity and who’s outcome established the entity has that property Complex abstract entities exist autonomously proof doesn’t confer fact but is based on our theories that underlie the proof
    - **Tags:** #goedel-incompleteness-theorem, #reality-(nature-of), #math, #world-altering-moment
    - **Note:** rules validate truth and never are falsified. I will be honest I am not sure what this says. The internet is saying the 2 points basically says in a consistent system of math, which means one that has a solution or answer there will be things that cannot be proved right or wrong, so there are in essence no real answers and no consistent systems. I think this means all math isn't really right or true
- Classical systems are unpredictable due to the inability to determine their initial conditions quantum systems are not unpredictable overall but behave differently in different universes so in any universe they are unpredictable Intractability is computational complexity that tender something unable to be computed in a reasonable amount of time ie billions of years Because there are millions/ billions of parallel universes all interacting at the quantum level it is intractable to understand any quantum system during and experiment even though we can know it’s outcome so classic systems are tractible while quantum systems are intractable Quantum computers can make previously intractable problems tractable the multiverse quantum computing allows us to use different states throughout the multiverse to make computation All practical any solid body contains atoms that without quantum effects would lead to complete chaos quantum effects are continuous across universes but discrete in any one universe quantum interference by charges particles in parallel universes prevents catastrophies and makes solid matter possible if a group of atoms is interfearing with other atoms it creates quantum decoherence which invalidated computational results Quantum computation would destroy public key cryptography because RSA relies currently on large numbers that are unfactorable ie intractable but quantum computers make this intractability a likelihood and very computable If our reality is all their is there is not enough atoms in the universe to calculate a prime factor and destroy public key cryptography so you need multiple universes to do this

    - **Note:** The multiverse draws on the computation power of different universes and quantum computation uses this to gain exponentially more computation. quantum decoherence is the splitting of two quantum universes from one (no longer coherent); this quantum decoherence produces a system too complex to predict through classical physics and makes computation across the multiverse intractable
- Animate vs inanimate matter a phenomenon is fundamental of a sufficiently deep understanding of the world depends on understanding that phenomenon understand as talked about here is about logic and physics that gets a more general more connections and deeper understanding of the world explains more with more fundamental phenomena implicated in a lot of other phenomena as a base explanation but don’t necessarily have a big effect a gene is a replicator but it can only function in certain environments replicator causes its environment to copy it. An organism is a copier of that organism genes and environment gene based understanding of life organism are just modes for genes Genes encode knowledge of processes and traits to make/ do that lead to survival so genes are just fundamentally passers/ conveyors of knowledge if the knowledge replicated it is helpful to survival although life is based on replicators life is actually the fundamental embodiment of knowledge Turing principal it is possible to program reality/ every law of physics genes are analogous to these programs all programs are indirect effect of life life is the means in which the turning principal in nature The cosmos will be fundamentally changed of humans/ life are to survive for billions of years so life can effect everything in the cosmos life can fundamentally alter the entire universe things can be more massive or stronger but knowledge is the most powerful force in the universe you can blow up a planet with knowledge Knowledge bearing matter has special physical fundamental properties Genes are arranged randomly but if you look at the genes of all humans across all universes some genes will be constant regularity in seemingly random area is proof/ a key to life Where there is real knowledge we get distinct and similar structure across universes Life is associated with the Turing principal of physics uniting biology and quantum theory

    - **Note:** Genes encode for knowledge that will get replicated if that knowledge it beneficial. Turing principal it is possible to program reality and every law of physics. Genes are analogous to these programs and all programs are indirect effect of life. Life is the means in which the turning principal exists in nature. Something represents a deep truth if it is interconnected with many other truths. Animate vs inanimate matter
      Evolutionary knowledge is local human knowledge is multiversal.
- Theories can be justified by explanation by being the best current theory after all relevant contenders are proven to be worse explanations the discoverer rarely had the best insight into a theory argue about the truth not about people. Arguments and explanations have the form of mathematical proofs going from assumptions to conclusions the process of argument doesn’t start with axioms and go to conclusions but starts in the confusing middle with gaps and inconsistencies the argument gets refined to include some axioms arguments end when explanations is satisfactory the axioms adopted are tentative theories argument isn’t deduction it’s purpose is to solve problems proving a given problem is explained by a given explanation

    - **Note:** Theories start in the confusing middle with gaps and inconsistencies aiming to solve a problem and it gets tested refined and replaced over time. We make theories to solve problems and take our best explanations at the time.
- The relationship between virtual and actual reality is part of the fabric of the world we can envision a vr object that can imitate any actual human feeling. The feasibility of a universal vr generator is the same as a universal computer a single machine that can calculate anything that can be calculated but since calculation is a physically process math is constricted by the laws of physics There exists an abstract universal computer who’s repatuar contains any computation that any physically possible object can perform ie the universal Turing machine or quantum computers if something is uncomputable there is no way of proving or getting an answer to the question It is possible to build a virtual reality generator that includes every physically possible environment a single physical object can perform with unlimited accuracy the task of mimicking any part of the multiverse if the world is to be fully understood this machine must exist to express all this knowledge The laws of physics because they’re physically possible must be able to be understood and somewhere in the multiverse some group or person has a perfect understanding of the laws of physics It is possible to build a vr generator no upper bound to the universality of vr generators somewhere in the multiverse
    - **Tags:** #physics, #virtual-reality, #bound-by-laws-of-physics-only, #computation, #multiverse
    - **Note:** Virtual reality can be made to mimic real reality making anything computable within the laws of physics possible. At some advanced point our knowledge of those laws is so complete that we’re basically the universe and god like. Only bound by the laws of physics everything else just a lack of knowledge which comes in time
- We can reproduce all functions by figuring out how the brain feels something and creating a machine that simulates those nerve triggers so no need to actually replicate it every time just figure out what the brain see and replicate this through virtual reality of it’s physically possible we can do it Any vr system needs sensors to detect humans nerves or what is coming from the human brain things to stimulate humans nerves song also to send into a brain and a computer to generate everything For something to simulate perfectly it needs to perfectly match the qualities of what it is simulating ie a roulette wheel has to be perfectly random We can never show a virtual reality configuration is accurate only that it is in accurate science is about understanding the whole of experience not just our senses if the environment is physically possible we just need to find rules for the environment and ever more accurate rules come from ever better explanations explanatory theories we need to know the physics to create a vr rendering and only after we create a be rendering can we know that we know all the physics All knowledge is encoded on our brain in basically virtual reality all reasoning thinking and all external experiences are forms of virtual reality physical processes that are observed virtual reality humans depend on this to survive Virtual reality is not just a simulation it’s an important part of the fabric of reality the basis of computation and human thought and experience art fiction and reality
    - **Tags:** #virtual-reality, #understanding-vs-simulating, #perception-vs-interpretation, #knowledge-(bound-by-the-laws-of-physics)
    - **Note:** virtual reality can be created. Everything is just sensory perception and if we reverse engineer these perceptions we can create a virtual reality. Understanding vs simulating. We can do this because it is physically possible
- The idea that our explanations are correct is very pompous and probably wrong given how wrong we have been in the past through even our most fundiMental explanations ie god so we should be very careful about it confidence in our knowledge gallaleos ideas of motion weren’t problematic because of the science behind it but from the shift it works view it causes as scientific method being a better explanation than god Explanations are judge by their superior ability to solve the problems they address an explanations that can’t be defended isn’t true We need to see if entities in competing explanations are real or not we need reasons for accepting or rejecting ancillary explanations or contending theories ie we need a definition/ criteria of reality If something would require immense computation effort to simulate we should easier assume it is real. What is out there is a reality that will respond with evidence when tested given a theory the evidence is out there to test it and improve and distinguish between theories it if need be people only need to look at things in the right way with good problems to get answers

    - **Note:** Explanations are judged by their superior ability to solve problems. We see explanations as competing for our interest and mindshare and we need to reason through what we think. We should assume lower probability events are true if they occur because a lot has to be true in an explanation for that output to occur.
      There are things we believe with fundamental certainty that are deeply and objectively false and we don't know what they are. We are being pompus to think we are at the end of history.
- The same observational evidence can be use to give opposite interpretations a farmer is feeding a chicken more because he likes to chicken or because he wants to eat it and justify both the true nature of knowledge prohibits inductivism because you can induce opposite outcomes from the same premises so it must be false we need an explanation centered theory of knowledge of how explanations come into being and how they are justified how why and when we allow perceptions to change our worldview once we have this theory predictions will follow Popper recalls science as a problem solving process when our best theory is no longer adequate we have a problem and need a new theory after finding a problem the next stage is conjecture and new theories the existing explanations should or could be improved upon one solves a problem by finding new or amended theories confining explanations without the previous deficiencies but keep the existing merits explanations are the best answers at the moment but are more the best forever and cannot predict future explanations that will unseat it or else it would already be that explanation 1. Problem 2. Conjectured solutions 3. Criticism/ experimental tests 4. Replacement of erroneous theories 5. New problem Incorrect predictions can be disproven but you cannot prove a prediction correctly Theories with more detailed explanations are preferred to less detailed ones because the more specific the easier it is to disprove and criticize so it needs to stand up in many more cases if it survives criticism it hemps its case more These stages are not iterative but fluid choosing new and better problems and looking for better explanations modify problems to be better formulated more solvable and more interesting constant backtracking revisiting old problems New problem explains new theory why it holds up to criticism and is better than the current one and why it is a good replacement All theories are subject to evolution and selection theory like a gene and explanations like a biological niche Knowledge can only grow through conjecture and refutation

    - **Note:** Inductivism is false and we should instead opt for the pursuit of good explanations and ever better ones from the existing ones we have. Build on past knowledge and constantly look to improve what we know through conjecture and criticism. Theories need to be replaced as all theories are wrong simply disproving one is inadequate. Our knowledge creation is fluid and conjectural
      We start with knowledge that we’re constantly trying to improve. We expect it to be wrong and replace it when we have found something better that has deeper explanatory power and this cycle just repeats
      pursue good explanations criticize existing ones replace with better explanations. Fluid state of conjecture and criticism backtracking inversion ect. Life is a process similar explanation to paradigms. Iterative learning process.
- Inductivism says theories come from observations while science says theories start as unjustified conjectures which proceed the observations. Fund broad deep and specific explanations we need to accept an explanation when it is the best explanation we have. Smaller effects I’m science are driving bigger conclusions science is not about predictions but about good explanations new theories are slight improvement on the last one we seek knowledge by solving problems and seeking better explanations human mind is subjective and fallible so how can we draw definite conclusions
    - **Tags:** #good-explanations, #inductivism, #fallability-(of-knowledge), #explanatory-knowledge, #subjectivity-of-knowledge, #problems-(studying-better-problems), #explantion-vs-prediction
    - **Note:** All our knowledge in fallible because we are fallible and subjective. We need to start from explanations extrapolating from data isnt science. Science isn't about predictions but frameworks for good explanations and solving better problems
- Interference effects really exist and so shadow photons must be real as non real things cannot interact with real things. Interference effects are weak because every particle has a counterpart and these are only intercepted with by its counterpart particle so interference is only observed when a particle and its counterpart separate and converge. The universes need to be close to display interference if they are too far apart these counterparts particles won’t interact at all. We don’t need deep theories to prove the multiverse but we need deep theories to explain and predict what other universes are like ie laws and how they effect each other and how this fits in with other subject. There is no real tangible and shadow we see ourselves as tangible and all other universes as shadow but we are no more tangible or shadow than anyone else is to their world this is subjective
    - **Tags:** #good-explanations, #multiverse-(interference-effects), #perspective-taking, #theories-(accept-best-explanation), #most-things-are-perspective, #shadow-photons
    - **Note:** Multiverse and interference effects. Creating deep and good explanations to predict how universes interact. We have real and shadow photons, but this is all a matter of universe perspective. Most things are perspective. We don’t need deep theories to prove the multiverse but we do to explain it.
      Multiverse exists due to shadow photons and most things are perspective
- Single particle interference phenomena rule out that the tangible universe around us is all that exists ie there must be a multiverse. Shadows when considered carefully require a new set of laws and a mew level descriptions and explanations that goes beyond what was previously regarded as the scope of science revealing the existence of parallel universes. Light does not travel in straight lines but bends slightly. Two pairs of slits so 4 parallel slits is not a combination of 2 2 parallel slit experiments but shows a different pattern ie some places that were illuminated with 2 slits are dark with 4 slits went dark with extra pair of slits so there is interference and whatever causes this interference behaves like light it could be the photon is interfering with other atoms in the light beam which pushes it off course but if we change it to only shoot 1 photon of light the pattern is the same so it cannot be altered by any photons in this universe. Photon passes through a slit and something Interferes with it deflecting it based on what other slits are open this thing that interferes is a photon as well that we cannot see a shadow photon or photon from a parallel universe. Shadow photons travel exactly like light but we cannot detect them the only thing it effects is a tangible photon which is interference is the only way we know the multiverse exists. When an opaque barrier is placed in front of shadow photons they are stopped but they are not absorbed by the barrier. Only a small amount of shadow atoms effect shadow photons analogous to what happens in the real world particle are grouped into parallel universes as particles interact with each other in each universe the same as they do in the tangible one and effect each other. Single particle interference shows there is more that exists than we can see

    - **Note:** This experiment is proof of the existence of additional universes within our own universe. Taking ideas seriously can lead to really interesting a near unthinkable results being a logical prediction. Interference effects prove Multiverse.
- Scientific knowledge consistents of explanations that can be proved by facts but facts cannot prove explanations our knowledge is getting broader and deeper we are converging towards a state in which there is one unifying theory with a wide theory that is not reductionist but also of high level emergent properties
    - **Tags:** #knowledge-(lies-in-the-connections), #good-explanations, #theory-of-everything, #systems-thinking, #inductivism
    - **Note:** Anti induction our knowledge is getting deep more systematic and generally applicable.
- Moving toward depth over breadth in knowledge. Emergence is when simple outcomes come from complex systems. Theory is everything is not a fundamental theories of physics but explains all fundamental and emergent phenomena. Under certain circumstances many small molecules move in a certain way that leads to the building of statues for war hero’s or economic policy. Quantum theory is deeper because it reaches outside of science. The best theories contain the deepest explanations about life thought and complex human systems not just physics depends on its closeness to our deepest explanatory theories 4 main theories are mostly high level 1. Quantum theory 2. Theory of evolution 3 theory is epistemology ie theory of knowledge 4. Computation theory the theory of wgat is computable these 4 are all intertwined can’t know about one fully without knowing the others These 4 combined form a basic theory of everything

    - **Note:** Due to emergent phenomena system systems can exhibit complex behavior and different explanations function better at different levels of emergence. We're increasingly becoming more specialized. The 4 key theories that Deutche thinks will form the theory of everything. Best theories contain the deepest explanations
- You can know everything not by knowing all the facts but by mastering all the concepts and theories memorizing formulas is not about knowing but memorizing a different set of facts. Knowing relativity formula doesn’t mean you understand relativity but you can just predict it better facts can’t be understood by being summarized in a formula but only by being explained best theory explains things and provides predictions. Most valuable attribute of human thought is ability to explain the fabric of reality. Instrumentalists are worried about making the right predictions but not worried about the underlying explanations Understanding comes through explanatory theories with high generality just knowing the facts is not important. Theories are about the why and what must be so about simplicity understanding is a high function Only humans can truly understand an explanation through creative thought. Theories explain more than we are immediately aware of. Modern theories are about creating fewer more general and deeper theories. New theories extend human understanding into areas of new knowledge

    - **Note:** This is about the power of explanation and formula could spit out a fact but true human knowledge comes from understand explanations and concepts then applying that in the abstract. To understand the fabric of reality you don’t need to know the relativity equations but what those equations mean.
      This is system vs point level understanding simulating vs understanding. Create explanatory theories
