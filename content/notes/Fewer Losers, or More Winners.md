### Highlights

- Episode AI notes
  1. In the world of bond investing, it is not enough to avoid losses, but to find or create winners. Investing in distressed debt can provide opportunities for capital appreciation. Oaktree now pursues strategies that aim for winners.
  2. Risk control is the primary focus for Oaktree. Understanding the difference between risk control and risk avoidance is crucial for investors. Risk control involves managing risks that align with desired outcomes and potential rewards. Intelligent risk bearing can lead to profitable investment opportunities. The focus should be on managing and minimizing losses rather than striving for a portfolio of only winners.

    - **Note:** Risk control vs risk avoidance is an important mental model. Avoiding risk is just taken unforeseen risks like opportunity cost. You need to play a game and play it well. You can go for a system with very few winners that avoids losers or a system that shoots for the moon and accepts a higher risk of losers. Here it’s all in the relative risk and return and executing well neither strategy is better.

  And since non-convertible bonds have little upside potential beyond their promised yield to maturity. It truly was the case that our main job was to avoid the non-payers, with the assumption that some subset of the payers would likely give us exposure to positive developments that occurred. It was an appropriate way to sum up our approach as bond investors. But fortunately, I joined up with Bruce Karsh in 1987. And in 1988, we organized our first distressed debt fund. Now we were investing in bonds that had defaulted, or seemed likely to do so. We thought we might be able to buy them at bargain prices because of the cloud they were under, giving us the possibility of capital appreciation. Bruce has since become well known for his investing acumen, and certainly his returns since 1988 can't be attributed to the mere avoidance of losses. Can you aspire to returns well above those available on bonds? It's not enough to avoid losers. You actually have to find or create winners from time to time. The returns generated by Bruce and his group show that they've done so. Oaktree now has a number of what I call aspirational strategies, meaning they need winners.

    - **Note:** Consistently being 2nd quartile over 20 years puts you in the top 5%. If you’re able to have winners and avoid large losers you’re able to progress more rapidly. This is especially true in debt which is a negative art you can only get back p+i but you can lose everything. Risk contro vs risk avoidance. When you take no risk yiu get bad returns so to get better returns you must take risk but you must balance or control this risk vs your goals or timeline. Investing is the intelligent taking of risk and risk control is a framework to do that. You won’t get paid without risk.

  While I haven't figured out exactly what that phrase means, I'm firmly convinced that for Oaktree, risk control isn't everything, it is the only thing. Risk avoidance. Understanding the distinction between risk control and risk avoidance is truly essential for investors. Risk avoidance basically consists of not doing anything where the outcome is uncertain and could be negative. And yet at its heart, investing consists of bearing uncertainty in the pursuit of attractive returns. For this reason, risk avoidance usually equates to return avoidance. You can avoid risk by buying treasury bills or putting your money into government-insured deposits. But there's a reason why the returns on these are generally the lowest available in the investment world. Why should you be well paid for parting with your money for a while if you're sure to get it back? Risk control, on the other hand, consists of declining to take risks that A, exceed the quantum of risk you want to live with and or B, you wouldn't be well rewarded for bearing. I've written in the past about what I call the intelligent bearing of risk for profit. Here's the backstory. I got my start managing money in 1978 when City asked me to run portfolios of convertibles and high-yield bonds. The farmer were mostly non-investment-grade securities issued by companies that had no alternative when seeking to raise capital. And the latter were, according to the terminology of the day, low-rated junk bonds. Clearly, they both entailed significant credit risk. Around 1980, a reporter from one of the first financial news networks asked me a provocative question. How can you buy high-yield bonds when you know some of the issuers are going to default? My response captured the essence of intelligent risk bearing. How can life insurance companies ensure people's lives when they know they're all going to die? The point is simple. These functions can both be performed in an intelligent, risk-controlled way. For that to be the case, the risk has to be, risk you're aware of, risk you can analyze, risk you can diversify, and risk you're well-paid to assume. Risks like this needn't be avoided. If you have real insight, such risks can be borne prudently and profitably. I know several investors who take much more risk than Oak Tree does and whose bad years are much worse than ours. But the few who possess genuine skill, what I call alpha, more on that later, produce jumbo returns in their good years, such that their long-term returns are exceptional. The clients are well-reported, assuming they have enough intestinal fortitude to hang in through the bad years. Thus, risk-taking isn't unwise per se, and risk avoidance is appropriate only for investors who feel they can't survive tough times. Building a good record Since A, all but the most cautious investing entails risk, and B, the presence of risk means results will be unpredictable and inconsistent. Very few, if any, investors are able to have only good years or to assemble portfolios that contain only winners. The question isn't whether you're going to have losers, but rather how many and how bad relative to your winners. ([Time 0:08:05](https://share.snipd.com/snip/83c2638c-911c-411c-b140-7a02a2bdbd13))
    - **Note:** Risk control how can you sell life insurance knowing everyone will die. Intelligent risk bearing. Risk you can diversify you’re aware of you can analyze and risk you’re well paid to assume. You shouldn’t take risk you can’t stomatch or else you fuck yourself. Having no losers is bad because that means you’re likely not taking enough risk. You need to mostly win have big winners mitigate your downside best as possible. Tennis at the professional level is a winners not a losers game. Amateurs can rally until and unforced error but professionals need to take intelligent risk by attempting winners to have a chance at winning. There are games that can be more aggressive or defensive and style doesn’t matter as much as having your winners outperform and exceed your losers. You can have 33 or 70 winners but having the better ratio of winners to unforced errors + magnitude is usually who wins. You can take risk and execute proportionally and win or you can never take any make money mistakes and lose. Balance risk and return.
