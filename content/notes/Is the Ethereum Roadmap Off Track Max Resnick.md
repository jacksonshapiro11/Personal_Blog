- Maximize User Welfare for Ethereum Rollups
  Summary:
  Base rollups offer a beneficial alignment of incentives between user transitions to and from Layer 1 (L1) and rollups, ensuring mutual satisfaction.
  However, challenges emerge due to the lengthy block times on Ethereum, which prevent base rollups from achieving feature parity with other rollups. Additionally, existing rollups might resist transitioning to base rollups due to their current revenue streams from sequencers, highlighting an incentive mismatch.
  To optimize for user welfare, the Ethereum ecosystem must rethink the sequencing process and develop a censorship-resistant L1 that prioritizes user interests over miner profit.
  While a shift towards base rollups could enhance the overall capability of Ethereum, it requires significant improvements to L1 to create a conducive environment for this transition, ensuring decentralized finance retains its place on Ethereum.
  Ultimately, achieving this vision involves aligning user welfare maximization with the potential implementation of base rollups, making it a crucial objective for the future of Ethereum.

  Speaker 3
  They're kind of just like outsourcing a lot of power to the Ethereum layer one. And it's like a formal alignment with the Ethereum layer one in terms of like block space overlap and economics. Do you think base rollups are like a viable solution here? Like what's your take on this direction for Ethereum rollups?
  Speaker 1
  So I think there's two things I would say. One is that they are certainly much more aligned from an incentive perspective. Because for a base roll up, if a user goes from the base roll up to the L1, neither side is sad about that. For a Ethereum, for the L1, if a user goes from the L1 to a base rollup, neither side is sad about that. So that's like a fundamental alignment that base rollups offer, which is a good thing. The downside of base rollups is that, first of all, the L1 block time is too long for feature parity with other rollups. So like you have kind of a, I think it's one second or sub one second block times on some of these other roll ups. And if you're a base roll up, you can only produce a block every 12 seconds because that's when the Ethereum block time is right now. So that's an argument for for lowering, lowering the block time down to four seconds two seconds, something like that. But the other issue is, again, I keep saying incentives and sorry to sound like a broken record, but what incentive does OPE, what incentive does base have, what incentive does arbitrum Have to become a base rollup when they're extracting a bunch of revenue from the sequencer? Giving away the sequencer, right, is like giving away the spice. They're not going to do that. And so maybe if we started out saying we're going to do base roll ups, that would have worked. I think we need either a very strong social pressure, which I don't think we can bring enough social pressure to bear quickly enough to do that. Or we need some other kind of solution because the base rollup isn't going to get there.
  Speaker 2
  Max, if all of the layer twos became based rollups overnight, it just like happened for, you know, some reason. Would your concerns be like mitigated? Yeah, certainly.
  Speaker 1
  And I think, um, there's a bunch of stuff that we haven't really explored on base rollups because they aren't super big. But if we have some certain feature advantages, like we have additional censorship resistance in real time at the L1, we can kind of maximize an arbitrary objective function for the Sequencing rule. So right now, if you try to do a base rollup on the L1, it has to basically maximize validator profit. And maximizing validator profit is all like very often directly in conflict with maximizing user welfare. And that's the kind of the fundamental tension of MEV in a single liter chain. But if you had a censorship resistant L1 that could kind of adjudicate arbitrary auctions, it could make kind of super based roll ups that are like going to sequence the block that maximizes User welfare. And I think that's like the end game that I would like to see of the roll up roadmap is like every roll up is based, but it is like super based in that it's not maximizing MEV, it's maximizing User welfare. And that's exactly what I think Ethereum should do in the long run, is maximize user welfare. And when everybody's aligned on that, I think I would be comfortable calling everything Ethereum. Okay.
  Speaker 2
  So I'm trying to get, there have been ETH reaches, ETH people sort of pushing the base roll up vision, namely Justin Drake, who sort of was talking about this on Bankless earlier in the Year. I'm trying to understand, like, because it seems like your take here and your philosophy, Max, is like, make Ethereum layer one great again, basically if I were to sort of summarize It in a meme. And I'm wondering how close all the roll ups becoming base roll up gets to that end vision. Is that like enough? Would that do it? Or is there still more that you're talking about?
  Speaker 1
  I think there's still more. I think we still need to increase the capacity. Like I said, I'd like Ethereum L1 to be the place where decentralized finance happens. And I think we're increasingly at risk of that happening elsewhere because we have not for it and Partly we haven't optimized for it because people some people think it's not important Even though it's clearly the most used app on aetherium And it's the reason that a bunch of us are here today because of decentralized finance So I think like we need to make a bunch of changes Part of the reason that I would like a based roll up transition, although I don't think it's possible to happen. So I think like there's, there's two things I can say, which is it would be great if that happened. I don't think it will happen. Uh, both of those are possible to believe at the same time. And I, I believe both of them, but in order to make base roll ups happen, we would need to improve the L1 a bunch. So as a side effect, because of a base rollup roadmap, we would also be making the L1 really good. And a lot of the same things that you need to make base rollups awesome are the things that you need to make the L1 awesome, which is why I think it's the most aligned path forward.

    - **Note:** L2s and l1 has bad incentive allignment which leads to taking more than is created. Allign the path forward. Based roll ups.
- Push Beyond Limits to Achieve Innovation
  Summary:
  To enhance the Ethereum layer one, three critical areas need improvement: reducing block time, improving real-time censorship resistance, and increasing throughput.
  A shift to faster block times is essential to avoid being outcompeted, while better censorship resistance must ensure users can access the blockchain without excessive waiting or high fees. Increasing throughput is vital to accommodate a surge in application usage, aiming for 100X to 1000X support for innovative apps.
  Emphasizing an optimistic and proactive approach to technology development, instead of accepting current limitations, is crucial.
  Challenging defeatist mindsets, akin to historical hesitations in achieving human flight, is necessary to catalyze progress and unlock Ethereum's potential.

  So what do you want to see out of the Ethereum layer one? What is it coming short on and how would you kind of change its directions in order to achieve this goal that you have?
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, so there's three things. Some of them are symbiotic and some of them have a little bit of tension. One of them, we immediately need to start decreasing the block time. It's actually ridiculous in the year 2024 to have a blockchain with 12 second block times. It's just basically so far from parity with anybody else that we're of course gonna get out competed if we stay at 12 seconds. The second thing is we need to provide much better real time censorship resistance. That means not, oh, you can get in if you wait 30 minutes and wait for a solo stake or two, who's not running medbus to include you. That means you can get in to the next block if you pay a high enough fee and hopefully the high enough fee is not super large that it becomes impossible to do basic decentralized financial Activity. So those are the first two and then the last thing is we need to increase throughput so that if you do build a killer app, we have enough throughput there that can support you. So we need to be able to basically support 100X or even 1000X in usage so that when people have ideas for amazing apps, they want to build them on Ethereum and nowhere else. I think the first two are kind of very compatible with each other actually moving to multi-proposer makes it easier to get to faster block times because you have Less need for leader Rotation, which is one of the most expensive parts of having shorter block times The third one which is increasing throughput is a little bit in tension with faster block times But I Think we can, we're so far from the Pareto frontier of what is possible with the technology that if we actually just tried, we could get extremely far. I think the issue is, I hate this type of attitude in Ethereum research, which is like, oh, you want to scale the L1, but we don't have the tools today to be able to make it process as many Transactions as Visa. Well, let's make the tools. It's such a defeatist attitude of, oh, you want to do this thing, but right now the technology isn't there. Well, yeah, I understand that. That's why I want to work on the technology to get us there. And it's like I posted this New York Times Article about Flight which was posted like six weeks before the the Wright brothers took their first flight and they said the technology for Human flight is not there. Maybe in 10 million years we could get to human flight But right now everybody who's working on this is just wasting their time. And I kind of feel like that attitude that's pervasive in the Ethereum ecosystem of like, why are you trying to work on this problem? It's too hard. It's very defeatist. I'm maybe too optimistic for them to say, hey, we have a bunch of smart people here. Maybe we could actually make this happen if we tried to work on it instead of giving up before we even start.
