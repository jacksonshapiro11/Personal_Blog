### Highlights

- Didn’t like being told what to do. Founded businesses from a young age and loved agency he is constantly being told what to do but realizes in life you need to have agency and choose your own path. His dad died when he was 22 and after the funeral he buried him personally sending the grave diggers home it was a sigh of moving on thankful of all the love his father had and what he put him through with that love. His dad allowed him to grow more than his peers at that time but in his death he was released from desiring his father’s approval and could focus on his future. His father gave him a lot of self confidence. His dad had a literary agency that he took over when he died. His dad was about the art but he was about the money he turned it around to make the agency successful. He had a conflicted relationship with his father but his dad believed in him even though he was a high school drop out.

    - **Note:** He was a high agency person who optimized for control despite being a high school dropout he took over his dad’s business when he died at 22 and focused on the business not the art to make it successful. He loved his dad but through his death he really was freed from his view and took on more agency allowed to be his own man. Buried his dad to get closure.
- He got in the real estate business realizing that the big commercial real estate firms ignored the small businesses that needed 1 unit many times instead of the lucrative one building. discovering an unmet need is an effective start to any business. Identify a niche being ignored. He would buy a building a rent units and once he confirmed the need he attacked the market aggressively.

    - **Note:** Francis saw an unmet need in the market and attacked it. Clear product market fit day 1 with little competition and unique differentiation. He unbundled and then rebundles real estate through a roll up strategy.
- When he got into real estate he was young and naive New York real estate had been beaten down and was out of favor he believed this would reverse. Always said he underestimated costs of projects. Had many issues with partners so warned of being careful who you partner with. Was naive enough to buy buildings in soho in the 70s for 10k now worth 10-100mm had he been an expert he would’ve ignored these areas. He didn’t want to sell buildings because he had a long term thesis he was buying buildings as often the only bidder. He got counsel from older wiser men in the industry which helped him long term. He saw the 70s when cash was impossible to come by into the 80s when money was essentially free. The turning of market cycles. Buying building was constantly about getting financing and improving the interior and operations putting your views against the market for what can be improved.

    - **Note:** Francis was non consensus and right with his real estate picks. He listened to others and uniquely differentiated himself. Then bet big to monetize his perceived advantage. He was stupid enough to act. Good life anti model. The value of lacking expertise
- His mentor said don’t cut corners because everything catches up to you in the long run and he didn’t while many competitors did.
  He invented cooping where people buy into the apartment instead of renting this was a new innovation and allowed him to make more money so he could pay a higher price for apartments. When he discovered the value in his invention he acted fast again and siezed the market. His competition could pay 7x gross rents but with coops he could pay 9x so he could buy anything. Based on the idea that rich and poor people both wanted to own their apartments.

    - **Note:** He invented coops around the idea that people wanted to own their apartments. He had a unique insight and invention that was true and unlocked value making him a ton of money. There is a small time when properties become available that will never be again you must act fast.
- He was rich on paper but due to tight banking conditions he could barely stay in business if there was a broken toilet because he was cash poor but in the 1980s his 35k line of credit turned to 50mm then 100mm the importance of holding on and staying in the game. Optimize for survival. This was a go go time.
  He was obsessed with having control and did everything in house. Once he was rich he didn’t know how to spend his time but time is what life is made of -Ben Franklin. He was a contrarian which worked for awhile but the collapse of 1987 hit him like a weight. The banks turned financing off and he gave his business at 1990 a 1% chance of survival after being a tycoon.

    - **Note:** He was constantly going levered long on himself and was rich but cash poor. This made him fragile and he almost got completely wiped out in 87. Stayed in business by miracle leverage and no margin of safety helped him build a path dependent empire.
      He became rich but didn’t know ho to spend his time. He was always very focused on control over everything
- His son changed his life you invest in something so much and the only thing that you can get repaid in is love.
  The real estate boom ended with the closing of a tax loophole in 1986 that allowed real estate companies to be more profitable This lead to a crisis in saving and loan banks culminating in black Monday when the market dropped 22% in a single day and the banks shut off funding. He went ti the banks to negotiate given he had 100mm of loans on unfinished projects and they didn’t understand why he was coming to them given he was current on payments. The banks couldn’t understand their shutting off financing would have a second order effect of higher defaults business and spread sheet thinking. He never delayed discomfort. Going to the banks early to negotiate while He still had leverage don’t run away from the problems run toward them the obstacle is the Way. Didn’t want the bank to take his money. He realized he was running out of money and put money in his wife’s name so it wasn’t exposed to the creditors he then saw investment and put $5000 in it company ended up going public and he sold out for 15 million this saved his business empire.

    - **Note:** Francis family gave him purpose in his life.
      The SNL crisis was brought on by regulation change that cleared out all the debt in the system. Francis was over levered and kinda ducked. A random small investment paid off and kept him alive. He saw the second order effects and was proactive renegotiating early to get better pricing and more optionally
- His son died at 2 drowning after he walked down to the pool alone. he cried for a year and never really got over it at times blaming his wife even if it wasn’t for a fair he never fully recovered from the situation the cost of losing a child is very high.
  His wife and he fight constantly on this and the relationship is very damaged they don’t get along he takes a mistress has a second family then his wife is diagnosed with terminal cancer out of the blue just weeks after her 50th birthday after having stomach pains she would die not 2 years after. Shows how quickly life can change
  2008 crisis disaster is what happens when people are focused on short term profit taking. When he invested in other which he did to gain diversification after the snl crisis he did so by investing in managers who he believed in who had a lot of skin in the game. Invested in horses not jockeys. 2008 was such a wipe out that no diversification worked. In real estate where debt was huff it was much worse. You need to avoid wipe our risks and stay in the game above all else. You need to be ready for all bad times with cash financial fortress. One can’t fall in love with bricks.
  Real security comes from adaptability
  Independent thinking comes from not assuming the status quo is the right answer or the most effective answer
  The relationships you build over a lifetime are as important as anything cultivate relationships
  If you find what you love the only exit strategy is death.

    - **Note:** The cost of losing a child is really hard. Life can change so quickly it did for this guy often so you need to appreciate every day.
      You need to remain flexible because crisis are inevitable. Maintain optionality for all situations especially when you're highly levered.
      Security comes from adaptability
      Don’t accept or assume the status quo
      Cultivate relationships only exit strategy death
