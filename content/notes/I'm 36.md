### Highlights

- The Physiological Sigh:
  One of the fastest ways to calm down.
  • 1 deep inhale through the nose 
  • 1 short inhale to top up 
  • 1 long exhale to empty lungs
  Just 1-3 cycles emphasizing the exhale will offload the max amount of CO2, slow your heart rate & relax you in real time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzhsb7md520fwrydmsw64ckp))

- Mel Robbins' 5-Second Rule:
  To break the cycle of anxiety and change your stress habits, simply count down from 5.
  5-4-3-2-1.
  This exercise:
  • Activates your prefrontal cortex 
  • Interrupts your habitual thought loops 
  • Shifts your brain from fight-or-flight to action mode ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzhsaxd406npj2pdpjnxg43p))
    - **Note:** 5 second rule
- 3Q Filters Test:
  If you want to curb stress, you need to curate your thoughts.
  Run them through Jon Acuff's 3 filters:
  • Is it true? 
  • Is it helpful? 
  • Is it kind?
  If they're not accurate, not serving you and making you feel worse...
  Discard them immediately. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzhs8eswbpm20bd3c4zmyhvx))

- Joe Dispenza's mental rehearsal:
  To perform at your best, you gotta visualize success.
  Imagine mastering your situation with vivid clarity.
  Engage all your senses.
  Feel the triumph and gratitude associated with it.
  Regularly rehearse this scenario to reinforce those circuits ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzhs8xca5y20cszqcmct8n8q))
    - **Note:** visualize your success
- Tim Ferriss' Fear-Setting Exercise:
  Conquer your fears by knowing them.
  • Define your fears for clarity 
  • Brainstorm prevention 
  • Plan for damage repair 
  • List the benefits of taking action 
  • Consider the costs of inaction

    - **Note:** conquer fears by knowing them then declawing them
- Here's why it works...
  Our brains tend to:
  • Ignore the high costs of our inaction 
  • Understate the positive results of taking action 
  • Exaggerate negative consequences of taking action
  Fear-Setting combats all three.

  Conquer your fear of judgment:
  Choosing attachment (fitting in) over authenticity (being yourself) sets you up for long-term health issues.
  Caring what people think is costing you your health.
  So to hell with others' opinions.
  Being healthy > seeking approval.
  You do you. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzhsejh95w902g6ctk9fv5jx))

    - **Note:** fear prevents us from starting but ignoring it facing it and conquering it allows you to live a more long term authentic life. The initial fear of movement is hard but its long term much better
- The Swish Pattern
  Among NLP's 100s of techniques, this one is the simplest and most famous.
  • Visualize the behaviour you want to change 
  • Quickly swap it with your desired behaviour 
  • Repeat until it becomes automatic
