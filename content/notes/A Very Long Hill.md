- Summary: Jeremy Siegel's book "Stocks for the Long Run" suggests that US stocks have historically provided a real return of around 6.5%. However, many investors struggle to match this return over the long term. Studies show that individual fund investors tend to earn lower returns compared to buy-and-hold strategies.

### Highlights

- Several studies, the best-known being Morningstar’s annual Mind the Gap report, show that the actual dollar- weighted returns earned by individual fund investors are much lower than the buy-and-hold time-weighted returns from the funds themselves. This impacts both active and passive approaches, with the average US fund investor earning 1.4% p.a. less than even the index funds they buy². Most savers don’t (or can’t) stay fully invested, resulting in ‘time out of the market’ and behavioural traps for those ‘timing the market’. The ‘gap’ might not sound like much, but it costs the compounder greatly. In our prior example, cutting the real return from 6.5% p.a. to 5.1%, reduces the Lenape’s imagined final hoard from trillions, down to a modest $9 billion. Buildings, not cities. As Brad Barber & Terrance Odean noted in an influential Journal of Finance paper on this topic, “Individual investors who hold common stocks directly pay a tremendous performance penalty for active trading.. Our central message is that trading is hazardous to your wealth.” Even perfect buy-and-hold passive investors experience effective turnover. Cap-weighted indices like the MSCI World or S&P500 suffer a surprising amount of activity as new companies are added, removed, or rebalanced by index committees. The S&P500 has seen well over 1,000 name changes since its inception, whilst the more comprehensive Center for Research in Security Prices database of US stocks boasts an annualised name turnover of nearly 8%. Does this activity add value? Not necessarily, as another Siegel study suggested. As of 2006 when the work was published, he calculated that if you’d bought the original S&P500 at launch in 1957 and then did nothing, you’d have beaten the actual, regularly refreshed S&P by more than half a percent per annum. Similarly, the Voya Corporate Leaders Trust, launched in 1935 (with explicit rules to prohibit turnover) hasn’t added a single new holding in 87 years, yet delivered double-digit nominal compound returns³.

    - **Note:** active trading and investing is never as good as buy and hold yet we still do it for some reason. This has very large negative effects on our wealth and we should avoid doing things like this. Compounding over the long term takes time
