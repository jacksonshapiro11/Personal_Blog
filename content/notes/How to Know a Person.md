- Quality of relationships determines the quality of your life. Officers in WW2 were more likely to come from loving homes. People who are maladapted compensate through different methods like avoidance.
- Depression is an all encompassing beast that consumes people and transforms them into something they’re not but they didn’t even realize reality is not their perception and the best and only real thing you can do for them is he there for them not help them or fix them and if they don’t make it it’s not your fault just see them as they are and care. Presence and caring.

    - **Note:** The only way to deal with depression is not by fixing someone, but by presence and caring
- To fix loneliness we need to be more moral which means caring about others not being selfish 2 helping people find a meaning in life 3 helping people get in tune with their feelings so they can be a better person. Life is more centered around getting rich having a good sat score than learning developing a personal philosophy and living with morals over material things. All conversations have an important subtext that encapsulates the lives of both people at that point that we must understand to have the conversation. What emotional baggage does this person bring to the conversation that I need to understand to really have it. You need to live in others mental frames and go deeper to better understand and empathize with them. You need a sense of respect in an interaction it’s not clear when it’s there but when it’s gone the conversation is dead. Your perception is influenced by your reality you see a hill as steeper if you’re carrying a backpack than if you’re energized with coffee or extremely fit. We see life through our affordances rich and poor people experience department stores differently.

    - **Note:** Bias inherent in models our perception is skewed by our beliefs. We see things colored by our past experiences and through our biases. The subtext of all conversations has more of an influence on conversations than the conversation itself ie words/ topic.
      To fix loneliness we need to start with caring about others and forming deep empathic relationships a life around eulogy not resume virtues and personal philosophy
      You need to respect others and understand the subtext of conversations align mental models with others and get to the ice berg beliefs.
      Eulogy vs resume virtues. Loneliness and bias inherent in models. Our perception shapes our reality. Subtext of conversations/ stories we tell ourselves.
- Help people by asking questions getting to know them as they are find out their super power. Ask deep questions that get to the root of who someone is. Asking deep not shallow questions can be about positives in life like adapting to change what cross roads their at fear in life. Ask humble questions where you can learn not leading questions that constrain the conversation nor one’s that are too general that they warrant to answer. Tell me about a time how does that make you feel ect. People want to talk about themselves if you just listen. People are very lonely but don’t want to be lonely there is a closing circle of people we feel we can trust and it’s getting smaller over time loneliness epidemic.

    - **Note:** Ask questions to understand people’s super power. People are getting lonelier. Ask honest questions seek to truly learn. Humble questions. Ask deep questions understand people at a deep level.
- A good conversation isn’t making statements it’s a joint exploration where someone floats a half baked idea and the other person works through it with you and plays with it floats it back. Good conversation starts in one place and evolves to another place. Conversation is a dance not a lecture. Good conversation is loud listening with deep attention. You should draw people in with your listening then grab them with your volley contribution. People love to talk about what they know and ask questions that go deeper in the ideas by asking next level questions. Want to know deeper what happened then what you felt in the moment then how you feel about that now. Don’t formulate your response just listen to learn pause and then move forward. Long pause are good in conversation. Do a loop where you repeat what someone said to you in your words because often we just don’t understand others. Don’t make this super obvious but ask it without being too inorganic. The midwife model is there to make people feel safe but also prod their thinking do understand them better. Learners committee helps you listen to yourself. The gem statement is the truth under the disagreement where you agree this is true but find the deeper disagreement under the disagreement. Find the values disagreement under the surface level root cause. This helps you get curious and find why you have the higher level belief from a lower in the stack belief. Don’t try to top others sit and share others experience don’t go over the top with your own. Listen to someone all the way until your meaning is completely clear.

    - **Note:** A conversation is about understanding others mental models. Go down the belief stack to get to the core belief from the proximate beliefs
      Good conversation is like a tennis match where you’re rallying with each other not dominating one side. Midwife model is making someone feel comfortable but also prying. Good conversations evolve rely on loud listening and deep focus.
      Don’t formulate a response even repeat back what they said to make sure you heard that right. Understand take pauses then ask next level questions.
      Pauses in conversation latent time.
- There is the perception reality gap and to truely know someone we most understand how others perceive their reality. We need to know how the interpret their perceptions that’s true knowing. How do these people construct their reality. A person is a transformation function of their path dependence a creative point of view. We view the world through the bias in our models. Experience life is a biased active process. To truely understand someone you need to see them deeply not reduce them to models. Align with others mental models. Why do you hate asking for favors or get sweet potato fries. See beauty around you. Life isn’t about finding yourself but creating yourself.

    - **Note:** to understand someone you need to see things from their point of view but to do so, so deeply that we reconstruct the path dependence we are all complex mosaics and to understand others you need to live in someone's mosaic
      To understand someone you need to see through their models.
- Before you become friends with someone get to know the little things. Little small talk is the on ramp to a more meaningful relationship. You must go softly and openly towards others not pulling them but giving them space to exist in your presence and playfully towards people. Bonds form through play like a pick up basketball game can create lifelong bonds. These people are partners but they are a humble part of someone else’s journey as they make their music of life. You can’t be the main character when accompanying someone. Not controlling but not a bystander. Let others voluntarily evolve surrender power don’t encroach on who someone is. You can try to walk them to water but make them think they got there themselves. Sometimes accompanying someone is being there not doing anything quantify not quality time going to someone’s funeral. When a bridesmaid dad died early she couldn’t make it through the vows and ran to the bathroom she walked out to see the whole wedding party standing there saying nothing but just there which was enough.

    - **Note:** Accompanying people is just about passing time and understanding them at a deeper level. A level past support of deep understanding. Relationships aren’t a push and pull they’re a dance. You understand the quirks of other people you give them space to open themselves up to you. Allow them to realize themselves and show themselves to you not just making them or forcing them.
- How you approach people dictates your interaction. If you reflect quiet you’ll get quiet if you reflect open you’ll get open. Tit for tat game theory in interactions. Respect and reverence for someone else’s soul you want to tell people you care about them and you’re a priority to them and you do this with your gaze. Illuminates are tender. Receptivity patiently ready for what others offer. Active curiosity see from their point of view. Affection truly knowing someone. Generosity of spirit for others. Holistic attitude don’t simplify fully see them. You can’t reduce someone to a few things. Well mostly fall short but we should try. Evil happens when we don’t see the person in others. Greatness in small acts like detecting anxiety or welcoming a friend. Morality is skill of being compassionate toward others. Good and evil start with our internal perception and dialogue improving before we can cast that feeling to the world.

    - **Note:** How you show yourself in the world effects how the world looks back at you. tit for tat game thoery. Recognize people's common humanity and appreciate them for their complexity. To truly know someone you cannot reduce but must investigate the,. Evil is when you don't see others for who they are. Greatness is the sum of small acts. Investigate someone's soul. You need to look at others as magic and without bias to truly know them. Open your heart and be curious
- Seeing people requires you not to be egotistic where you only care about your opinion. Step outside of your own point of view and be curious. Reason 2 people dont see others is anxiety about interactions fear is the enemy of communication. Naieve realism you think your view of the world is correct. We think less is going on in others minds and we are deeper/ lesser minds. Objectivism and detachment. Essentialism and generalization/ stereotypes. Static mindset. You need to train yourself to see others. It’s easy to be ignorant of others.
- You need to be open minded and open hearted to have good relationships. You need to learn social skills as well as empathy which this guy didn’t have. We don’t realize how to do this so we don’t have deep friendships. See someone deeply and make them feel seem is at the heart of all human interaction. Human beings need to be seen the worst thing you can do to someone is not hate but be indifferent. See people for who they are and deeply understand them. Truly see people. Diminishers see people as tools and stereotype just involved with themself. Illuminator are very curious and seek to understand others ask the right questions and light people up. Create a different way to be present with others.
