  The better way, the beautiful way. But once you find that way, it's the greatest feeling in the world. And then the next few sentences, next sentence actually is so important. I think it is, it might be the most important reason that I encourage you to read as many biographies as you possibly can. And it's the fact that no one, there's a quote from James Dyson that I love. He says, everybody gets knocked back. No one rises smoothly to the top without hindrance. The ones who succeed are those who say, right, let's give it another go. Every single book, every single story, you have a fork in the road, the presenter with the fork and road on the lead, they can go left, give up or they go, or they figured out and keep going Straight or go right over the cases. That's not the best analogy. I'm going to roll with it. So anyways, this is what this is an example here. This was the point where I almost gave up thinking it would be too much and not worth it. And really what kept him going is the fact that he was, he had two modes. I'm either programming, I'm doing nothing. So he says, but there wasn't much else I could do, or excuse me, much else to do. And so we see his schedule at the very beginning of creating Linux. And this went on, what I'm about to describe to you goes on for months. This took a lot of work. A program, sleep, program, sleep, program, eat, program, sleep, program shower, briefly, program schedule. By the time I ([Time 0:28:20](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ed71c883-bb89-43fc-b7f7-dd4afa15d53e))
    - **Note:** He almost gives up in every key story there is a fork in the road where quitting is the only option and these people just say no and keep going. Linus didn’t know how to do anything but program so when he hit a snag he just had to keep going. He basically sits in his apartment all day writing code and then decides to release it to a few people when he had a working prototype. Big things start small and you need to let it grow and cultivate. Start small and scale. Linux slowly diffused into the community and instead of asking for cash he asked for postcards to understand his spread out it had gotten. He just wants to spread his product at the base level then sell valued added services on top but he really gets thought of as this technological monk who didn’t need money.

  In the footsteps of centuries of scientists and other academics who built their work on the foundations of others on the shoulders of giants. So this is where he starts talking about, Hey, I'm keeping track at the time, you could see like how many of these news groups would be people would gather together, talk about things They were interested in, you know, sports, whatever the case is, and one of the most popular on the internet at the time, this is early 90s, was Linux. And he says, I could easily track the popularity of Linux and trust me, I kept track. Well, it might be somebody's idea of a folk hero. I've never been the selfless, ego free, techno love child, the hallucinating press in Sysam. And he talks about I wanted to do good work. And for me, I want Linux to success. And the definition of that success is a lot of people would use it. And this is where he goes into his, this is some of the most important, what I found interesting, talks about the way he quote unquote manages or approaches work. I did learn fairly fairly early on the best and most effective way to lead is by letting people do the things do things because they want to do them, not because you want them to. The best leaders also know when they are wrong, and they're capable of pulling themselves out. And the best leaders enable others to make decisions for them. Let me rephrase that much of Linux's success can be attributed to my own personality flaws. One, ([Time 0:33:54](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c4938467-681c-4032-bad1-979bc5e513b1))
    - **Note:** Good leadership is empowering others to create and checking your ego at the door to admit you’re wrong. Let others do what they want not what you want admit when you’re wrong and evolve. Allows others to build things for him. Open source code was a great way to get your work out there and also get status in the eyes of your peers. Just because he wasn’t charging didn’t mean money didn’t motivate him it was just a slightly different motivation. He likes the American system of power law returns to the best workers not slight variations in salary. In one month really or week/ day he leaves his job at the university of Helsinki turns in his thesis has a kid and moves to America to work a commercial job. People give him pushback for selling out to the man but he has an inner scorecard and doesn’t care still works on Linux in his new job. He believes deeply in sleep never overworks always gets his rest.

  If he doesn't sleep, at least 10 hours a day, his whole day is ruined. Jeff Bezos talks about he needs at least eight hours of sleep a night and he makes his best decisions in the morning. So we just see this over and over again. Goes into a little bit of detail about the difference philosophical difference between Linux and Bill Gates and how Bill Gates actually had him on its target list, too. We saw this a few weeks ago in that book Overdrive. He says, so folks who ventured into the depths of Microsoft tell me that they've seen my face on dartboards. So more about how he manages or whatever you want to phrase you want to use it for Linux. What seemed to amaze them next was the administration of Linux. They couldn't grasp how the largest collaborative projects in the history of humanity could possibly be managed so effectively when the average 30 person company typically degenerates Into something resembling resembling barnyard chaos. Somebody coined the phrase benevolent dictator to describe how I ran the whole thing. The first time I heard the term all I could think of was some sunny nation general with a dark mustache handing out bananas to his starving masses. I don't know if I feel comfortable with the benevolent dictator image. I control the Linux kernel, the foundation of it all, because so far everybody connected with Linux trusts me more than they trust anyone else. My method for managing the project with hundreds of thousands of developers is the same as ([Time 0:42:17](https://share.snipd.com/snip/279d2e6a-1520-4644-bce6-5d91e8ef6e20))
    - **Note:** He was a benevolent dictator of Linux small companies were disorganized but somehow this decentralized mass of people could build an entire operating system. Linus controlled the kernal as the benevolent dictator because no one else really had the chops or claim to do so other than him. He doesn’t proactively delegate but let’s people run with subsystem development when they raise their hands. Doesn’t make decisions let’s things happen naturally. Always optimizing for fun and enjoys his life. He realizes he’s an asshole due to his lack of social skills but the benefit of open source is that it doesn’t matter in a decentralized system. The great thing about open source is the leader can be an asshole and can be subverted. Human creativity is rare and has a massive price tag if yiu can’t make a good product and instead try to control people you’ll eventually go out of business. Don’t control the resource make a better product. Create a product that competes on its merits not just has vendor lock in. Delight customers. People want solutions they want a hole not a drill. Only thing in life that is constant is change. New issues comes up and the world evolves. That what he sees as fun. Love life for your own entertainment.
