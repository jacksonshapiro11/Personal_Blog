### Highlights

- Challenges of Financial Capital Structures for Founders and VCs
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  This one's great because it involves two parties that don't know anything about financial capital structures, which are founders and VCs. And so that presents a lot of opportunities. In this present day, you have all these companies that massively overraised and are now realizing that even with a good viable business, the founder person is never going to make any money because the prep stack and because they just raised too much. And you get this weird situation where VCs don't have any incentive to tell you to shut down. There are exceptions. There are a handful of really great VCs, which is both economically and morally the right thing to do. But for the most part, a VC has no good reason to tell you to shut down because they're in the outlier business. And a founder is going to just for a while just be terrified of telling their investors that they failed. Well, not even that they failed. That's the crazy thing about these. Maybe you have 10 million a year of revenue, but you're only going to grow 60% this year and you raised somehow that's bad. Yeah, because you raised it 300 million or something. And you're going, oh man, am I going to have to do a down round? If I do a down round, then I'm really going to get drowned out on the prep stack. I'm never going to make a dollar here. It's going to be other five years. But you don't want to go to your board and say, I want to give up on this company. I just realized I'm never going to make a dollar from it. And your board doesn't want to come to you and say that because then there's this boogeyman story of my VC told me to give up the coordination problem. ([Time 0:10:10](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9d35ea7b-8d0d-4f1a-9376-eb63a83aeed7))
    - **Note:** Investing in coordination problems and misaligned incentives make it clear why you are investing what your particular edge is and why it’s messy for others. Like an index fund being a forced seller when something leaves the index you want to see these situations and unravel them. Like founders who overraised and can’t grow into their valuation.
- Unconventional Buying Strategies and Taking Weird Risks in Company Acquisitions
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I mean, people would ask are those even assets, and I think that's really what you want, at least if you subscribe to the Munger theory, which is that it's better to find your own lake than to try and be the best fisherman. I think you get a reputation for it, but honestly, there's not a lot of people out there who can do this stuff because it's really weird, and it requires very fast speed of execution, which requires really abnormal underwriting abilities or requirements, and you have to take weird risks on things that other firms can't or won't take risks on. A lot of company buying, at least in my experience, is not dissimilar from Craigslist. If you show up first with cash in hand, you get the deal, maybe if you're not the highest price, and so I think a lot of it is just being willing to go and do that and say, yeah, okay, we'll do this weird thing.
  Speaker 2
  Very Buffett-esque, where you would hear examples of him writing extremely large, increasingly large, checks over his career in very short periods of time over the weekend or something.
  Speaker 1
  That's what inspired us. We couldn't believe that we had tried to sell, in my case, a business to a public company in Christianity's case to private equity, and we couldn't believe that it was six to nine-month steak dinners, backslapping, terms, all this stuff. We looked at Buffett who could buy a $30 billion airplane parts manufacturer an hour, and we were like, hold on, this company is a stripe account on a website. ([Time 0:20:30](https://share.snipd.com/snip/42aca9b6-44ab-4081-a84e-99d15403c47b))
    - **Note:** Being able to spot a situation where the company or vc is looking to divest and there is too much opperational overhead. They just want to get our price isn’t central. People want operational ease. Also trust your gut when something feels wrong it usually is. You’re working with people with asymmetric knowledge.
- Pattern Recognition and Experience in Investing
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I think a lot of investing is pattern recognition. It's nice because compound interest dovetails well with pattern recognition. So I think part of it is you just see what matters and what doesn't. A first time buyer will always care about things that just don't matter at all. I think a lot of that comes from just reps. But I think the other thing that I really noticed is when I started, none of us had any finance or investing background. We were just fans of Buffett and Munger and read all the books. And so I think there's an air of insecurity that comes from that which leads to asking a lot of complicated, jarguing questions. But in the first four or five years of doing this, I would ask a lot of very complex questions, which in retrospect, I think we're mostly about trying to telegraph to the seller that I knew what I was doing. What's an example? Well, we used to make DCFs just so we could all feel like we made a DCF. Just that box. Yeah. Well, it wasn't even that. It was more that we thought, well, geez, everyone else does this. So we better make sure we do it. Now the questions that I'll ask a seller are what does this business do? Why do people buy this business and not the other business? How do you make money? How did this start? How did you get here? You make $20 million a year from a chrome plug and how the hell did that happen? Just understanding that. And I'll see new analysts who don't really understand what the business does, but they don't ever want to say, what does your business do? Because they're worried they're going to look unprepared or whatever. And I think that tracks because fundamentally, the more quantitative the analysis is, the more of a commodity it is. And so what really gives you an edge, in my opinion, is experience on the quality of it. It's going to be that very simple line of questioning that actually gives you an advantage. ([Time 0:25:52](https://share.snipd.com/snip/34185863-9398-429d-bcbb-9f3b18486d65))
    - **Note:** Quantative analysis is being commoditized so it’s important to understand the qualitative and ask stupid and basic questions like how you make money do you can really understand the business. Find the main thing that makes it run and if you take longer than 3 months put it in the too hard box. Good ideas smack you in the face. You don’t need to deploy some guy waited 6 years between investments.
- The Puzzle of Why People Spend Time on Things They Don't Like
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Why do you think so many people spend so much of their time on things that they don't like doing?
  Speaker 1
  I think this is the single most important question in the world, probably, because I think it's extremely puzzling that world where a lot of people can cover their bases in terms of food and shelter. They still spend the grand majority of their life doing things that they don't like doing. I think it's a deep and troubling puzzle that I don't really have the answer to. I think a lot of it comes back to not really understanding what your true desires are and having fear around losing things, being stronger than desiring what you actually want. I basically think most people wish that they like things that they don't actually like. For example, even in my own case, I think a lot of people wish they wanted to make more money than they thought they actually did. Or they wanted status more or it was important to them where they live or what clothes they wear or whatever. I think a lot of people don't actually want those things that much, but they feel like they should. Or they're very scared of the consequences of acting like someone who doesn't. Then they really get into this mess. But I mean, yeah, it's a real puzzle. People with tons of options will spend their whole life working jobs. They hate. It's really strange. It's really tragic. It's really bad for the world because you're not going to do great work. I once was talking to a therapist, performance coach who would tell people what he thought their true calling was. I had had a few highly accomplished people tell me that it was the most devastating thing they'd ever done in their life. I was puzzled by that. His name was Jack Skeen. I asked him, why do people describe this as devastating? He goes, well, if I tell someone who's a very successful investor that they need to be a third grade teacher, do you think that would be devastating if it weren't true? Well, no, of course not. You just think you wasted your time and money. It's devastating because you know on some level it is true, but you know that becoming a third grade teacher now means you no longer live in Tribeca. You don't have the same friends, you don't have the same apartment and all that is terrifying to you. So the fear of loss. There's some great tragic loss to the world about you not being that thing that you feel called to.
  Speaker 2
  And so, yeah, I think it's a really difficult puzzle and it really just comes back to most people don't really know what they want or aren't denial about what they ultimately want. And that path that you feel personally, do you feel like you really know what you want and have set your light up accordingly? ([Time 0:33:22](https://share.snipd.com/snip/30af3101-3ee2-4620-86ac-e58632f2f189))
    - **Note:** Do things and work with people who give you energy some things are objectively awesome but they don’t give you aenergy and that’s fine. What would not take a billion to stop doing. Taking breaks and digesting your life to figure our what you love doing. Thinking about what gives you the most energy and sometimes that does against your job status and self concept so it’s hard. Hedge fund investor vs 3rd grade teacher.
- The Rewards of Good Work and Finding Your Calling
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  I just had Kevin Kelly, the founder of Wired and just an amazing guy in a lot of respects. Speaking of lines seared onto one's brain, his line that the reward for good work is more work is my favorite chibileth of all time. If you say that to somebody and they start nodding, that's the kind of person I want to hang out with because they've solved the problem you just described. What would you do if the only reward was getting to do more of that thing? What is that for you? And almost no one has a professional answer to that. And I'm curious if you think there's ways of nudging oneself in the right direction, other than taking a sabbatical and just not putting pressure on yourself to find it.
  Speaker 1
  Another cut at that same thing is as you get closer to doing the work that you're called to, you get less envious of people or rather the things that make you envious or fewer. It's a very common thing that I see of top school, super ambitious kids to have to put down everything around them as bad to justify what they're doing. And I think that's really a terrible way to live. And what you see with someone who's really found their calling is they're just not envious. And I can still tell it exists for me. An example is if I see an NFL quarterback, I'm not envious of him. It's like, you know, that could have been me or even worse. I'm not going, Oh, well, you know, he sucks. He's late in the major after whatever. ([Time 0:40:38](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4fd1027e-9e6b-4a3d-a678-185a24f1e38e))
    - **Note:** Finding your calling mitigates your own envy because you’re doing you and that’s ok. When you’re lazy and depressed it’s clear there are deep issues in your life and job. Try to be a quarterback in your own life and do what you love. Doing things like buffet is a little boring very simple but not easy. The insurance company generating float is great when you have the best insurance guy in the business. Find leverage points in a discussion. If someone wanted a Ferrari but their wife won’t let them buy it put it as part of your offer sometimes your not the best offer but provide different benefits.
- The Difference Between Hardship and a Fall
  Key takeaways:
  - The concept of categorizing people into binaries, such as before or after their personal fall, is discussed as a way to understand someone's situation in life.
  - The notion of pre and post fall is seen as an indicator of a person's capacity for suffering or pain and their potential reaction to adversity.
  - The idea of a fall represents capitulation and being brought to one's knees, rather than the severity of the hardship itself.
  - The reaction and the lessons learned from a fall hold more significance than the actual event.
  - Determining if someone is pre or post fall can be observed in their eyes and the loss of innocence or the extent of their life experiences.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Think you and I share a deep interest in people and what makes them tick. And we both really enjoy and have talked a lot about fun and simple categorizations for people. And you've turned me on to the simplest version of that which we'll call binaries. They're this or that one or zero. And I'd love for you to explain three, four, five of these that you've used before to categorize people. I just think they're all so interesting. And probably the one that resonates the most with me that you've talked to me about is this notion of whether or not someone is before or after their personal fall. Explain what that is, how you came on the idea and why it's a powerful way to understand someone's situation in life.
  Speaker 1
  Pre and post fall is really I guess a perversion of the Christian idea which is has someone really been brought to their knees by life. You can see it immediately. And I find it's entirely uncorrelated to who they are or what they grew up with or what they do in life or whatever. It just seems to be random. And you can just see in someone's eyes whether they've really been humbled deeply by life or they haven't. And the reason that I find it useful is it gives you a sense of the capacity that that person has suffering or pain. I find it to be a very good indicator of if something bad happens to this person, how are they going to react? An extreme example would be some of multiple combat deployments. Probably not going to get too disturbed by something going wrong. Whereas maybe someone who's never had anything go wrong in their life, it's really going to disrupt them.
  Speaker 2
  Is there a difference between hardship and a fall? It seems like everyone's had some form. Obviously it's a gradient, but everyone's had hardship. Is this just saying hardcore hardship or is there something more truly binary about this concept for you?
  Speaker 1
  I use the word fall because it's capitulation. So it's actually not really related to how hard the thing is. You could maybe go through an extreme hardship and not be beaten down. But I literally think of it as like maybe even literally been brought to your knees and just this moment of life is out of my control to some regard. It's more about the reaction. What you come to recognize is true about the nature of reality from that than what the actual thing is.
  Speaker 2
  What is the fastest way to tell if someone is pre or post fall?
  Speaker 1
  I've heard you say you can see in their face. This might be a weird answer, but I just think you can see in someone's eyes right away. You can just tell. Maybe it's the loss of innocence or something, like just how much have you seen? I actually think it probably gets worse the more you ask someone about it because then there's this weird thing about wanting to perform or say, oh, that was really hard or whatever. ([Time 0:50:27](https://share.snipd.com/snip/cef3de33-b3ca-4f53-b5a7-4ae8d1ae7136))
    - **Note:** Someone being pre or post fall and some deep personal hardship they have experienced in their life that brought them to their knees and deeply humbled them where they gave up hope. Being easy or hard to kill. Call under pressure they’re used to things going wrong and they won’t let the moment overtake them. Downside protection. This is being strong willed the will not to die. Like a roach. The hard worker loves the linear where the harder you work the more success you gave but it’s better to bide your time and wait for the non linear outcome.
- Machiavellian advice: How to succeed in an organization
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, so I've given this advice to a lot of people now and it's worked really well, so I'm pretty confident in it. This is only Machiavellian advice, which is if you want to really succeed relentlessly at an organization and this probably applies to small or basically organizations where you're within arms reach of the principal, you have to say off the org chart, whatever you do, say off the org chart because there will always be a temptation of the principal to make your report to someone and you cannot do that. And if you do get forced to report to someone, then you always want to report to two or more people because the thing is you always want to be the way that you can get ahead in these organizations, especially if say you're younger, you're under credentialed or whatever relative to other people is you want no one to really know what you're doing, but they all know that you're very favored by the principal. So you're because a guy that is kept around and everyone knows that the principal likes you, but no one really knows what you do. No one's entirely clear on who you work for and you got to fight. It is the nature of any bureaucracy to try and suck you into the org chart, make you report to someone, do something like that, and you really got to fight. But that's the way in which you can get ahead because I think what people really failed to understand is that all that matters is whether the decision maker likes you in a company. Everything else is completely unrelated. And you can see this because people who do get work get fired and people that don't do good work but are liked, don't. So if you're looking to get ahead and create favor in an ([Time 1:03:58](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8c0f44c7-144a-4bd4-9871-1599d784060f))

    - **Note:** Stay off the org chart and in the good graces of the decision makers. You want good mentors but you don’t want to necessarily work under them more as their shadow or with them. The distribution and network is underrated you want to build a strong and loyal following that is the key to good deal flow and monetization. Podcasting is seen as a bit weird but it opens the world so much that it’s an incredibly valuable and still under appreciated medium.
- People's desire for clever and interesting investments
  Key takeaways:
  - Many people are interested in starting profitable holding companies
  - Owning cash flowing assets may not provide superior returns
  - Indexing one's abilities for a holding company is strange
  - Owning businesses is not that exciting
  - There is a fixed amount of companies available, causing prices to increase
  - Interesting alternative assets are often overlooked
  - People prioritize feeling clever or different over best returns
  - Sometimes the obvious choice is the strongest
  - Admiration for managers who have owned Berkshire for a long time
  - Paying someone else to own Berkshire is a solution for lacking personal confidence
  - Growing an audience based on advice can be seen as a legitimate criticism
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And now I literally talked to two or three people a week who want to start profitable holding companies. I think it's the rolling fund of high rate era. Even very liquid founders want to buy these cash flowing assets. And I just think that's very strange because it doesn't really even scratch the itch of like a good investor. A good investor is after superior returns. There's something just very odd about indexing your own abilities for holding company about saying, Oh, I'm just going to like crew all these mediocre assets that'll like sum up to some cash flow amount. I just think that's strange. And also owning businesses is not that exciting. And again, the same problem there. There's a fixed amount. Constellation literally has all of them in one Excel spreadsheet. There's a fixed amount of these companies. And so the prices have gone up and it's just strange. So I'm always skeptical of these weird kids playing soccer forming around these little weird pockets of alternative assets. Probably the stuff that's actually interesting is stuff that no one's talking about trading electricity futures or giving loans to charter school. Weird stuff like that. All of a sudden HVAC becomes really popular or airplane leasing got really popular for a while. People love the contrarian thing too. Peter Thiel has a great line about how the trade of the 2010s was just buying Feng if you wanted to be the best performing hedge fund manager in the world or whatever you just hold Feng. And that's it. Something like an 8X or something like that over that period. But no one did that because it's boring and you don't get paid for that. And so people don't actually want best returns. They want to feel clever and do some like weird little thing that makes them feel interesting or different or something. But sometimes you just got to do the obvious thing and just be really strong on it. You know, I always admire those managers who have been paid two and 20 for like 40 years to just own Berkshire. I kind of think that's awesome because they were right. Yeah, they were right. And they're providing this service. The service that they were providing was the LP does not have the personal confidence to own Berkshire on their own. So they actually need to pay a huge premium for someone else to give them the confidence to own Berkshire and it's like a tax that they pay for not having the conviction to do it themselves. And I think that's great. That's solving problems for people. So God bless them.
  Speaker 2
  I think one of the legitimate criticisms of maybe podcast or just posting in general is that it's very easy to grow an audience on the back of what is or feels like advice. ([Time 1:13:27](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7e879161-95af-40fe-b089-8fff00e25f0c))
    - **Note:** People want to do things that are hard and scron the simple and easy people want to seem clever and do different things but had you just owned fang and did nothing you’d outperform everyone. Contrarian idea of being self assured.
- "Fundamentally Unserious Questions": The Illusion of Productivity Advice and the Addictive Nature of Self-Help
  Key takeaways:
  - The podcast or posting in general can easily attract an audience by providing advice.
  - The approach of constantly seeking learning and preparation may not always be effective.
  - General advice is often unreliable as it is derived from personal experiences.
  - Counterexamples exist for every piece of advice.
  - Most advice questions are not serious and seek quick satisfaction rather than genuine solutions.
  - Consuming advice can create a false sense of productivity.
  - Routines and performance can become excessively fixated upon.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Think one of the legitimate criticisms of maybe podcast or just posting in general is that it's very easy to grow an audience on the back of what is or feels like advice. It's very easy also to spend a lot of time optimizing, preparing, learning. It feels like a universal good like, yeah, you can't have enough learning. You can't have enough preparation. Can't have enough knowledge. But I think you make a good point in some of the conversations we've had that maybe that's the wrong way to approach some of these things. And so I'd love you to talk through that criticism of this cult of learning, so to speak.
  Speaker 1
  Well, first of all, and advice. I think the only honest thing that you can say about advice is there is no general advice. I think giving general advice is a complete trial and move is just terrible. When you give advice, you are just extrapolating some general rule from your own experiences, which say asking, create some general rule about the world from your own life. That's kind of what you're asking with advice. That's the problem. Like, if anything, you should just ask people what they did, and then maybe ask them to explain what they were thinking at the time, then you can do your own inference if you want. The second thing with advice is all advice cancels out. So you can find counter examples to every single piece of advice. Someone's done something. Someone's been very successful doing the opposite. So that's another knock against advice. And then the third problem with advice is that it's fundamentally unserious. So the only real, sincere and serious advice asking is a very tactical and specific question. If someone reaches out to you and says, I don't know, the podcast example would be, but for an investment, it would be like, I have this company doing this transaction between these two states. I know you've done this before. What is the right way to think about tax planning here? That's like a useful advice question. Most advice questions, they're like, how do I become an investor or whatever? They're just fundamentally unserious questions that what you're asking for is give me something that I can go, okay, that'll make me feel good for a second, then I can just go back to doing whatever I was doing. And that's all productivity advice. There's a great little parable about a 12 year old comes up to Mozart and asks him, how do I start writing symphonies? And Mozart goes, well, go to music college and work through it and study the greats. And then you can write a symphony and the 12 year old goes, yeah, but you were writing symphonies when you were 12. And Mozart says, why didn't go around asking people how to write symphonies? And I think that's so profoundly true that really, if you catch yourself asking these, like, how do I start a company or something, you know you're not serious. You're just procrastinating. You just want to consume information that feels productive or useful. Advice is just such a racket for that reason. And it's addictive. I don't get me wrong. I've read tons of self-help books. I've read lots of business books. I've consumed hundreds of hours of podcasts. It's a really compelling sham because it makes you feel productive and it does a classic shell game, which is it takes one thing that you can justify as feeling productive, but it's actually just entertainment, coats entertainment, this educational or productive sense. And then, yeah, the preparation point is in the same vein, like, there's this really weird hyper fixation on routines and performance and things. ([Time 1:15:45](https://share.snipd.com/snip/33b40cf2-b5a8-42e9-8f6d-154e9ca15d13))
    - **Note:** Advice is general and you learn so you feel good but you’re not making any progress. 12 year old asking motzart about symphony’s or starting your own company if you’re asking his then you’re not serious. Feeling like you’re learning while doing nothing is dangerous entertainment. Indicative of lack of conviction and if you do abstract things you can never feel like a failure. Don’t sharpen your sword for the battle that never comes. Don’t delude yourself. Michael jordan they we’re deceiving themselves about what the game required. Figure out what you like and do it then backfill problems.
- The Power of the One Call Everyone Needs to Make
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  You said that you've done the millions of help books. I guess me too, because I'm just curious about all things and that no one's more interested in anything than themselves, I guess. But there is one thing that you and I've discussed that you've taken away from one of those explorations that I think is incredibly powerful, which is this notion of the one call that everyone needs to make. Can you describe what that is and how you discover that idea and put it in practice?
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, I got this from doing the landmark forum. And the idea, which is on the theme of extremely simple but very hard, is that if you tell anyone, there's one call they should make, everyone immediately knows what that call is. And people will go 40, 50 years without ever making it. And sometimes the call, five minutes, 10 minutes, and everyone knows if you're hearing this, and if that thing that you immediately thought of and then felt bad about feeling about it or try to push out of your head, that's the call is. And doing that has massive returns. I had to do it in the landmark forum because it requires altered setting to be able to coach yourself to do it.
  Speaker 2
  There's this corollary question, which is what's not being said, which I think is actually quite productive in businesses too. If you just once a week or something sat down and we're really honest with yourself about like, what am I not saying and to whom? ([Time 1:20:11](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8abeab56-5ee8-4209-a600-49eeb7be292b))
    - **Note:** There’s one 10 minute call that people put off for 50 years what’s not being said and why. Finding leverage points having hard conversations executed well.

  Venture capital started to fund high cap X businesses with very low probability of success that if they did succeed would have humongous outcomes. And your average software company does not hit any of those marks. And so I think if you're going to raise venture, you should really have a very good reason. There are clearly businesses out there that are perfectly designed for venture capital. But most people I think raise venture because of one of two reasons, at least initially, one is because they don't know what else to do. And it's the default path for starting a business. The other is it's just easier. So most businesses you could bootstrap the business by selling a customer and getting them to prepay. Basically every business you can do that in. And even the best venture funded founders I know have done that. But that's hard. And it's easy to go get a couple million bucks. And then you get an office and you pay yourself a salary. And it's just easier. And to be honest, I don't really have any problem with that raising a few million dollars, especially from an honest institutional, I wouldn't even consider that venture funding. It's some kind of weird hybrid thing. But once you start going institutional, that's when you really can't backtrack.

    - **Note:** Most venture software companies don’t need venture they can bootstrap. People are on the treadmill and they actually don’t need time money but they think they do and the raise for general purposes instead of something specific. Convertible note. Not all businesses need capital reinvestment. Expose yourself to your hero’s.
