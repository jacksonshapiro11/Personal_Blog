  Lucas. George Lucas unapologetically invested in what he believed in the most himself. As a result, the film empire that he created would empower not just him but other filmmakers to produce movies exactly as they envision them, without a studio imposing its own priorities, Complaining about budgets or micromanaging the process. George Lucas, the small town son of the owner of a stationary store, had said no to the family business and then built a cinematic empire based on his own uncompromising vision of the Film industry, not as it was, but as he thought it should be. Much of that vision lay in the possibilities presented by new technology, technology that Lucas developed with his own money. I can't help feeling that George Lucas has never been fully appreciated by the industry for his remarkable innovations, the director Peter Jackson once said. George Lucas is the Thomas Edison of the modern film industry. ([Time 0:04:52](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c12fc16e-5064-4fb6-a5e6-4c03c5778dc3))
    - **Note:** Lucas invested in what he believed in most himself and rebuilt the movie industry how he thought it should be and went from small town son to big start didn’t want to go into the family business. Desires control and independence sci fi was seen as dead until he made Star Wars. He’s very depressed there is no control over Star Wars just the movie executives and asked to listen to them even though they don’t know what they’re talking about and so he values to always have control going forward shapes his life. Learns from history as a form of leverage his dad was very traditional he was always looking for mentors in books. He was so tech first he wanted things to be better , hard-working cleverness you wanted special effects to be better so he built his own special effects company mad scientist juvenile delinquent if you wanna understand entrepreneur study the juvenile delinquent saying this sucks I wanna make it better he liked to Scrooge mcduck for inspiration on blending hard work and cleverness. Not doing well and school and he’s directionless but believes in himself and wants to make money to secure freedom he’s ways risking everything but maintains fiscal conservatism. He’s not dumb he just hates being told what to do.

  Now he's in film school. And the film professors are like, okay, we're going to practice making films. And they give you like this sheet of instructions and it must be, you know, film, it must be filmed in black and white. Must be this you must this story must look this way. It must not go over, you know, this length. And George Lucas is like, I don't give a damn about your instructions. I'm going to do what I want. Lucas made his intentions immediately clear with his first onscreen credit. This was no student assignment. It was a short film by George Lucas. That is the big letters. That's what he put on this movie that he's making. Lucas had chosen to set his film to music and open defiance of his professor's instructions. And so the movie he made is called look at life. Even 50 years later, look at life is an impressive debut, aggressive, political, and utterly confident. As soon as I made my first film, I thought, Hey, I'm good at this. I know how to do this. From then on, I never questioned it. Lucas said. And right from the rip, he is completely obsessed. He preferred shutting himself in his top floor bedroom, sitting at the drawing board, planning out his films and sketching out ideas. I would always try to get him to go out to parties and clubs and stuff. This is his roommate. And George would usually stay upstairs in his room, drawing these things. He called them little star troopers. This is like a decade before Star Wars. So he's drawing these things he calls little star troopers.

He was a tyrant didn’t like working on teams very competitive. Very talented. Sit at computers and make movies hates writing was bad on sat but loved editing. Very resourceful and hated rules so he would break into rooms and never followed the rules just did what he wanted. He got an assignment And they didn’t have the right cameras or enough time so he just broke the rules and stole cameras and worked weekends in order to make it perfect. Very intense. He didn’t want to be a director but decided he had to because he didn’t like being told what to do. He met Francis ford Coppola at 28 and had this relationship the rest of his life. Wanted to make things cheap and was ruthlessly efficient and cost conscious but also would bet the farm when he knew he had a winner. He made student films and this lead to a lot of opportunities, Ing meeting Francis Ford Coppola and Spielberg mega product for society. Francis told him he needed to Insource writing or he couldn’t be a serious filmmaker so despite hating it, he did so
- Riding the Wave of Perfect Timing
  Summary:
  Despite facing initial rejection and reluctance from Hollywood studios, Lucas and Copeland persist in seeking funds for their venture, American Zoetrope, in San Francisco.
  Their timing aligns perfectly with the studios' realization that investing in young talent for low-budget independent films can yield significant profits after the success of Easy Rider in 1969. This timely epiphany by the studios enables Lucas and Copeland to secure the necessary funding, exemplifying the importance of surfing the wave of opportunity for achieving success.

  Have any money so they have to go to the studios to ask for money and at the beginning as they're trying to do a deal or fundraise for what they're going to call American zoetrope is actually The full name the Hollywood studios like no you can't make movies up there you have to do it here but Lucas is very stubborn he's very persistent he's also willing to take risks but he's Like I love San Francisco I don't want to live in Hollywood and so I'm just going to keep knocking on doors until I find the money now they have something happens that you know you they in Some ways they have perfect timing because that you have to ride a wave go back to the episode you said on portrait of a nomadic Charlie Munger's surfing model is so important you know Analyze extreme success and he always asks him something like they had to surf a wave what wave are they surfing and the studios actually figure out at this exact same time that Copeland Lucas they would have never got the money if this didn't happen this is why I'm telling you at the exact same time they realized oh like if you the studios figuring out like if we can just Hire young talent making independent films can actually print money because they make they make films for almost nothing and some of these you know these are like power law outcomes And so what do I mean there's a 1969 remember they start this in 1968 they're like we're gonna do this they bang on doors Hollywood's like screw yourselves we're not giving you any money The next year the film Easy Rider comes out okay so it is written by ([Time 0:45:23](https://share.snipd.com/snip/16b3c9b2-3f8d-4381-9b9a-3a3c07fcf5ec))
    - **Note:** He sees people making their own independent set ups for movies and Barnes are on ranches that becomes the inspiration for Skywalker Ranch often will happen is they would think something and then they see someone doing that and try to learn from them first they were thinking why can’t I make movies at 25 and then they saw Francis making a movie at 28 and then saw this guy building his own movie studio cause they didn’t really wanna work at the studio they wanted to do something something Different byt had to go the studio route first to get money to do that. Easy rider was an independent film that became the most profitable film ever and Lucas and Coppola wanted to do more independent stuff and this provided them the wave to surf in order to be able to do that. Lucas wanted money to be free. He got a loan to build out the studio and Coppola start spending it on expensive equipment and helicopters and not the important things and obviously fails because they’re not doing what makes their beer taste better.
- Predicting a Bold High-Tech Future in Movies
  Summary:
  Both Coppola and Lucas predicted a high-tech future for movies in the late 1960s, foreseeing a time when movies could be purchased like soup in cartridges for home viewing.

    - **Note:** His first movie is about refusing to accept the status quo. People are in cages with open doors. Leaving the safe indoors and rejecting the status quo to do something different become a big theme in his movies because that’s what he did. Montra stay small be the best don’t lose any money. Hated giving up power. This was a bad time in his life, but ended up becoming the great moment, getting fired and losing his first company as it leads to the founding of Lucas films. He got 10k to write a screenplay and he farmed it out to someone else because he had writing that guy fucked it so he needed to take a loan out from his dad and Francis Ford Coppola in order to write it himself which he works from 8 to 8 bleading on the page. He was 30 with no money trying and begging for money to make his movie. He couldn’t take another job if American graffiti was successful he needed to capitalize so he had to turn down everything. He’s encountering problem after problem and he has to solve them. He takes a lower director fee to bet on himself and get a % of the profits. He’s constantly solving exestebtial issues. Road di success is paved with mistakes well handled. Business is problem solving. He hates writing so he forces himself to do it.

Then negotiates his first Star Wars contract for cheap but gets merchandising and sequel rights, which made him billions also makes Lucas film produce it. He needed new and better special effects so he founds his own special effects company. Obsessed with control and high agency no one could do it so he invented it. Lucas had to check himself into the hospital because directing gave him so much anxiety and depression he became a producer didn’t direct another movie for 20 years after this. The first Star Wars was a disaster people told him he should make more artistic not kid movies it was over budget fox almost pulled the plug crazy. Had he not had deadlines he’d still be writing the script today. Constraints breed innovation and action. When it gets screened first everyone hates it only Spielberg thought it was any good and thought it was a hit that could make 60mm all these people were wrong it made 775mm at the box office and launched an empire. Unique marketing they published a comic book and put adds in scientific journals to create enthusiasm. This marketing effort lead to so much pre hype targeting the right group of fans.
