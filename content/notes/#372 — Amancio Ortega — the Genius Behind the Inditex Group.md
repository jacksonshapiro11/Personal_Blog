  He's 72 years old when he says that the important thing in life is to set goals and put all of your soul into fulfilling them. He says, I have dreamed of growing this company since I was nobody. A few chapters later, it says the same thing. Since I was nobody and had hardly anything, I dreamed of growing. We have never been complacent, nor have we accepted easy success. Optimism can be very negative. You have to take risks. This was something I repeated tirelessly to all those who have joined the company. Another example of this, we gave it every day. My priority has always been the company, and I have committed myself to it with full dedication from day one. And it's not just that he describes himself as a man on a mission. Other people literally say that Ortega is a man of mission. He is so convinced of what he is and what he has to do. And when Ortega is asked, like, what is the why behind life? He says, I am absolutely convinced that we all come to this world to fulfill a mission. None of us are here by chance. So the first thing he does is get a job in a shirt store. He's 12 or 13, and he's just a gopher, an errand boy. ([Time 0:06:52](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1466c1df-8754-4485-bb22-8bca76ac2339))
    - **Note:** He’s very mission driven. His mom is denied a loan and at that point he resolves to work so that never happens again. He took his job very seriously. Opportunity handled well leads to more opportunity. He’s very customer focused. Focused on vertical integration. Starts with what the customer wants and works backwards. His goal is to make clothes fashionable and affordable. He uses technology to change their style as the industry progresses. Applying technology to existing industries die innovation. That could offer up to date clothing. Clothes were seasonal he turned it from idea to product in 15 days. Embraces tech. Charges competitive prices.
- Anticipate Demand, Deliver Swiftly
  Summary:
  Zara's business model revolutionizes the fashion industry by closely aligning product offerings with customer demand through rapid adaptation and integration of design, manufacturing, and distribution.
  Unlike traditional companies that rely on long lead times and seasonal collections, Zara focuses on real-time trends by employing a team of young trendspotters who identify current customer preferences in various global hotspots. This feedback loop informs a remarkably fast design and production cycle, enabling Zara to deliver garments that resonate with customer expectations shortly after demand is identified.
  By controlling a significant portion of its manufacturing closer to its headquarters in Spain and other nearby regions, Zara enhances distribution speed, further accelerating inventory turnover and maximizing revenue potential.
  The emphasis on technology in logistics streamlines operations, allowing for daily inventory updates from worldwide stores, which is vital for maintaining responsiveness to market changes.
  Ortega's commitment to vertical integration across logistics, textiles, and other sectors positions Zara as a manufacturing logistics leader that prioritizes innovation and quick adaptation over industry norms. This bold approach underscores the belief that mature sectors are not immune to innovation, and by rejecting limitations based on established practices, Zara continuously redefines industry benchmarks.

  While other companies make their collection at once for the whole season, Zara continuously modifies its products according to what people are asking for. Their secret power is they can offer up-to clothing. This is one of the craziest things. I got to read these whole two paragraphs to you because it's one of my favorite things. It actually talks about the business model. It comes from the end of the book, but I want to talk to you about it now. So it says, from the inception, Ortega had an obsession to give the customer what they wanted quickly enough to meet their demand and a price attractive enough to increase the frequency Of purchases. Until Ortega, the textile process was on a different trajectory. Collections were thought out and designed more than a year in advance. They were then manufactured with a three-month lead time. And finally, they were delivered to distributors who were responsible for sending them to stores once or twice per season. Ortega looked at that and said, that doesn't make any sense to me. This posed three fundamental risks, a significant buildup of stock, a bet on collections that might not succeed in the market, and uncompetitive prices given the margins that had To be charged at each step of the chain. Ortega saw from the beginning a clear distance between the production process, which was too long and not dynamic enough, and the end consumer. The founder wanted to integrate design and manufacturing first, then complete the chain with distribution and sales in his own stores. This was a holy shit moment for me when I read the following sentence, turning the customer into his source of privileged information and not just the receiver of a commodity. Ortega was interested in what the customer asked for and was willing to adapt the entire production process to their demand. He was convinced that if he managed to complete the cycle, meaning completely integrated, he could reduce the margins by between 70 and 80 percent, which would clearly affect the price The end consumer had to pay for each garment. This was always Ortega's obsession, reworked, reinvented clothes in direct connection with what the consumer expected, clothes that appear very shortly after. And so, again, people around him, when he started, had this idea and starts building this up and making these crazy investments in technology when other people in this industry just Don't understand this, then nobody else does it. You know, people are like, oh, you can't do this. Nobody else does this. Ortega did not care for that argument. He says, even if no one else does it, I'm going to do it. This is another thing that he had in common with Henry Ford. He's the Henry Ford of fashion. I'm telling you, it's very obvious to me. Henry Ford says, I refuse to recognize that there are impossibilities. I cannot discover that anyone knows enough about anything on this earth definitively to say what is and what is not possible. That line jumped out because it says this phenomenon, this idea, this entirely new model that Ortega invented has broken, it says they were talking about compare them to other people In the fashion industry, right? It has broken schemes and has shown that there are no mature sectors where everything is already discovered, but rather companies are managers with closed minds who resist innovation. So to do all this, they need to do basically three things really well. They need to find out what customers want. They need to design and make the clothes quickly. And then the third thing is they need to distribute the clothes to their stores very fast. And so to out what customers want, they hire a ton of young people. And then these young people go around and they actually look at what people are wearing. So they have people dispersed in New York nightclubs and shopping areas of Paris and trendy bars and hotspots in Spain. And what they are doing is they're tracking the trend. They don't want to know what you're going to wear two years from now. They want to know what you wear right now. So you have people all over the world that work for Inditex. They're actually on the street seeing what people wear, right? They also, the author has given this tour at the headquarters in Spain, and they show this huge room with these drafting tables and tons of designers. And they're surrounded by thousands of international magazines, mostly fashion and lifestyle magazines. And everybody working in that department, what their job is, they have to spot the dominant trends. So once they identify what the customers want, they design them and then they start manufacturing and making them. And when the book starts describing not only the manufacturing process, but also the logistics process, what you realize is that Zara or Inditex is a manufacturing logistics company That uses technology as an advantage. And so here's one description as they're touring the plant. We toured the different warehouses where the complex task of preparing the garments before they left for different destinations was carried out. Large rails crisscrossed the ceiling and the factory-made clothes, rotating unceasingly in an orderly and repeated manner, went to the labeling, ironing, bagging areas, and finally To the point where the rails forked according to the store that would be their final destination. In this last section, sophisticated and effective machines folded the jackets, blouses, or pants and placed them in huge cardboard bins. If the garment wasn't folded because it had to travel upright, it slid onto hangers that were automatically inserted into special containers. The address of the store was printed on each of the boxes. This is going to blow your mind. Modern machines with hardly any trace of humans operating them. Our mouths literally opened in front of the futuristic panorama that we had before us. I didn't completely understand the complexity of what they were showing us, but I did sense that a significant portion of the secrets of a company destined to be at the head of the global Textile industry were being kept and designed there. And so then it gets even crazier. So they're at the ultra modern plants. So I guess I should point out to you the fact that Zara, our Inditex, it's not headquartered in a big city. Instead, it's headquartered in a rural corner of northern Spain. And I've seen this reoccur as a benefit in not only the books, but some of the world-class entrepreneurs I get to meet as a result of the podcast, is they set their company up away from everything. And so for Inditex, this ultra-modern logistics facility that the author is taking a tour of, she says tha... ([Time 0:21:27](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9cea7cc5-024e-453f-85ce-1420711d3e9d))

- Prime Location Equals Strategic Advertising
  Summary:
  The strategy of renting, rather than buying, prime retail locations reflects a shift in focus for companies like Inditex.
  This approach allows them to secure the best sites without the drawbacks of ownership, as they benefit from advance notifications of upcoming retail opportunities. Investing in prime locations effectively serves as a form of advertising by placing stores where foot traffic is highest, thus enhancing visibility.
  This model suggests that high-quality retail spaces can act as superior promotional tools compared to traditional advertising methods, making the investment in location a strategic choice rather than a simple expense.

  And at the beginning he was like buying, it says over time with the growth of Inditex, he actually changed his formula instead of buying the locations for Zara, he now rents them. And that surprised me for a second until I thought more about it. I said, well, yeah, because he wants the very best store locations. And what if he doesn't own that store location? He doesn't want to sacrifice on not having the best just because he owns the store. So he rents them. And then now because they've become such a large tenant, developers will now tell him in advance or give him advance notice when they're opening what they think is going to be a prime Retail location. And so the way I thought about this is, OK, well, you're spending money on prime retail locations instead of advertising. Prime retail location is advertising because if you are just, again, just where the people are, where they're walking by, your stores become a demo. And as you and I know, because we've talked about and done episodes and read books about the greatest advertiser, agency founders, and greatest copywriters throughout history, a Demo is always better than an ad. And so I would argue it's just a matter of accounting. They're spending a lot more on advertising and marketing, but they're doing so in the form of prime retail locations. ([Time 0:33:05](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4f506c82-5959-40d6-85cb-08c265b8fe88))
    - **Note:** He spent a ton of money on prime retail locations, which is a form of advertising. He understands human nature and you know when you’re shopping there things may not be there the next time you come so it produces scarcity. He never went to even high school so he turns the world into his classroom. Growing up poor, give him a giant chip on his shoulder. He works every day relentless work ethic. Never gets mad or raises his voice and wants to learn from everyone to get better every day. Loves the people. Never complacent always wants design the best business in his category. Great listener and he’s harsh but fair. Hate prayers always wants to improve always says we not. Loves simplicity. Loves learning and growing does what we wants to do because he loves it not what he has to do.
