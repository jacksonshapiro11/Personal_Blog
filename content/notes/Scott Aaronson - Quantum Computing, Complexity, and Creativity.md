### Highlights

- **Potential for New Quantum Algorithms**
  - Fundamental quantum algorithms like Grover's and Shor's were discovered in the 90s.
  - Many current advancements are extensions of these algorithms.
  - It's possible there are undiscovered algorithms as fundamental as Grover's and Shor's, but it's been 25 years.
  - Classical computer science also relies on a few basic techniques discovered early on.
  - Discovering new quantum algorithms might require identifying fundamentally new problems people haven't considered before.

  So let me ask you now, I remember in class last year, you said, you know, that basically, we have a very, a few very important quantum algorithms like Grover's and Shor's that were discovered In the 90s, and now a lot of stuff now is just an extension of those algorithms. What do you think is the potential of finding, is there a good reason to think that there are other quantum algorithms to be discovered that are as fundamental and important as Grover's And Shores were?
  Scott Aaronson
  I would, I would love it if there were, right. I I'd be, I'd be thrilled to, you such an algorithm, have one of my students discover it, right? This is, you know, I mean, that's the kind of discovery that we enter this field for, right? You know, if we're being intellectually honest, you know, we have to admit that, you know, it's been 25 years since Grover's algorithm was discovered, right? And, you know, maybe no other quantum algorithm as fundamental as Shor's or Grover's has been discovered, you know, in the last 25 years. What we have discovered, you know, as you learned, because you took my class, was, you know, a lot of, you know, an enormous number of generalizations and new applications and variations Of Shor's and Grover's algorithms, you know, including what are called quantum walk algorithms, including, you know, phase estimation based algorithms. And, you know, and some totally different quantum algorithms were also discovered, although, you know, the problems they solve are maybe more abstruse, right, or, you know, you know, It's harder to explain what problem they're solving. And, you know, so, you know, you could wonder, you know, is it lack of imagination on our part, or is it, you know, I mean, I, the, the, you know, another possibility is, you know, if you Look at the history of classical computer science, you know, what you find is that there are a few basic techniques that were discovered very early on in the history of classical CS. One of them is dynamic programming, like, you know, breaking down your problem recursively into sub-problems. We could say, in general, recursion, divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, convex programming, you know, Gaussian elimination, right? And, you know, and most of the, you know, I mean, the field of classical algorithms is enormous. And yet, you know, most of the classical algorithms that we know, are somehow built up out of these motifs that are just that were discovered very early on. And we don't normally think of that as a failure of classical algorithms. We just think of it as there are these fundamental features of the algorithmic universe that people noticed as soon as they started looking. And then you can go much further, but you go much further by building on the basic things that you have, right? And so maybe we should think of Shor's algorithm and Grover's algorithm not as just specific algorithms, but as sort of some of the basic design motifs of the world of quantum algorithms. And then, you know, it's not surprising that they were discovered very early on, just like dynamic programming was discovered, you know, right at the beginning of the history of classical Algorithms. So, you know, so, you know, I mean, that's one point of view. Now, another point of view is, you know, if, like when people ask for more quantum algorithms or, you know, they hold us to account for our failure to discover more quantum algorithms. You know, I like to answer that question with another question, which is, well, what are the problems that you would like these algorithms for? Right. And amazingly, that question almost always stops, you know, they ask it, right? Because like, they didn't even, you know, well, because no matter what problem they name, you know, there's an excellent chance that people in quantum algorithms have thought about It, you know, and we know, you know, something about how much speed up you can get from a Grover type algorithm, you know, but we have good reasons to think that you're not going to be able To get better than that. Or, you know, I mean, or, you know, we or or we say, well, maybe there's like if in the case of the graph isomorphism problem. Yeah, sure. Maybe there's a polynomial time quantum algorithm, but probably just because there's a polynomial time classical algorithm. Right? And that, you know, and it's just, it's that that hasn't been discovered yet, right? Although, you know, there's been major progress toward it. So, you know, no matter what problem they name, right, I mean, probably someone has studied it in the context of quantum algorithms, and I could then tell them for that problem, you know, Exactly what is the current situation? And, you know, what are people stuck on? You know, and so it might be that if we want to discover fundamentally new quantum algorithms, that the way to do it will be to realize fundamentally new problems, right? Problems that people hadn't even thought about designing an algorithm for, you know, previously, right? You know, the way, you know, another thing, you know, another way that I like to put it is, you know, like, like, in any, you know, in any given area of math or science, there is this phenomenon Of low-hanging fruit that gets picked very, very early on. And then those of us who come into the field a little bit later have to leap higher if we want to find any fruit. I think the ultimate solution to the problem of low-hanging fruit being picked is to find a new orchard, you know. And so, you know, figure out what are, you know, potential problems that quantum computers could solve that no one has been thinking about before. Maybe people actually starting to get quantum computers, as they finally are today, that they can experiment with will help stimulate the discovery of those new problems or new ([TimeÂ 0:53:46](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0774b47b-d45a-4a43-85ae-2d4d92b1d3d6))
