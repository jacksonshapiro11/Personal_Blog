### Highlights

- Learning from those we disagree with
  Key takeaways:
  - Learning from those with whom you disagree is possible and can be surprising
  - It is important to listen to others and not cancel them
  - Respect for others is important even if personal feelings may differ
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So back to this particular one, trying to learn from others that you disagree with and maybe even find offensive is I'm, I guess I'm been surprised in my own life to find that people that I really fundamentally disagree with could say something that I found was, well, yeah, that's true. Like I remember, I remember myself coming around to agree with Dick Cheney about something. And what Dick Cheney said was the climate change in environmental was not about personal virtue that had to be changed at the systems level. That's like, yeah, that's right. Here I am, I'm agreeing with Dick Cheney because he had, you know, something to say that was, that was true. So I've sort of learned to try and to spend some time to listen to people and not to cancel them basically. And that is, it's tough because we have a natural, a natural revolution. And also there's personality types. I mean, we're not obligated to like everybody. I feel no duty to have to like everybody, but I feel that there is some duty to kind of respect people. In a certain sense. And this idea of kind of respecting someone that you don't like and disagree with, it's difficult. ([Time 0:08:37](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a4039ed1-18b4-4b69-bc5d-1780e8ea94de))
    - **Note:** Would write down notes to himself in proverb form much like Marcus and would repeat and reread them. Be open to listening to people you disagree with
- Being an Equal Opportunity Disruptor: Advice on Avoiding Idea Lock and AI Takeover
  Key takeaways:
  - Rotating unhappiness and being an equal opportunity disruptor can help manage expectations and maintain reach over a diverse audience.
  - High correlation between opinions suggests being in the grip of an idea lock that limits one's complexity.
  - Unpredictability makes it less likely for AI to take over one's actions and behaviors.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  With your reach, it's like you're the mayor of New York, right? Like not everybody's going to be happy all the time with what you're doing. I like the idea of rotating the unhappiness, sharing it equally.
  Speaker 1
  Exactly, an equal opportunity disruptor. So, you know, by the way, this is one of my bits of advice. If your views on other things can be predicted from your views on one thing, you need to be very careful that you're not in a grip of an idea lock, but that's what it is. It means that your, your opinions are too highly correlated with each other. And that's suspicious because most people are much more complicated if you're really genuine, you're going to be much more complicated than that. And also by the way, this is a new piece of advice. If you're unpredictable, in that way, you're much less likely to be taken over by an AI. You want to live your life in a way that the AI cannot predict what you're going to do. They cannot kind of fake you or cannot imitate you. ([Time 0:11:49](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1a6e0880-d3fe-4e0e-9f13-e7316724ff27))
    - **Note:** Don’t become an ideologue. If you disagree or agree on a party line you’re easily replaced and likely not thinking. Having an unpredictable style and thinking pattern makes you more differentiated and harder to replace.
- Finding a balance: The one-third rule for optimization and experimentation
  Key takeaways:
  - One rule suggests spending two thirds of your time optimizing things and one third trying new things
  - This rule is based on research in various different fields of life
  - It is more efficient to optimize something that works rather than try something new
  - Optimizing your favorite thing is a one to two ratio versus trying something new which is a one to three ratio
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  What is the advantage to doing that? So there's a couple of things, a couple of bits of advice buried in a book about that. One is this rule, which was actually based on some research in various different fields of life that when you're trying to optimize something versus trying to explore where you have something that works and you just want to make it better and optimize it versus doing the inefficient thing of going out to try something new. And it comes down to something like when you go out to eat at a restaurant, do you get your favorite thing that you know works or do you try something that is a new dish that may not work? So the ratio is actually one to three, two to three, one to three. So you actually want to spend two thirds of your time trying to optimize things that you want to go deeper and better and then a third trying new things and that's been shown in many, many ways to be roughly true. ([Time 0:19:21](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fd4bf8e3-dceb-40b6-a15c-86e4f514d0b7))
    - **Note:** Set deadlines and optimize 2/3rds explore 1/3rd. Constraint optimization problems. It can always be better
- Defining Success on Your Own Terms
  Key takeaways:
  - Don't compare oneself to others' outsides, grow your own metric for success
  - Talk to successful people to realize the need for a different metric
  - The Amish have a unique measure of success
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I've had the privilege of knowing a lot of maybe I would say accomplished people, successful people, famous people, super rich people. And man, the outsides not represent their insides and we tend to want to compare ourselves to their outsides, to their own ideas of what success is. This goes back to don't aim to be the best in to be only. I think we're I I'm better and I do better when I am not trying to imitate someone else's success state. How they define success. I mean, in a certain way, what you want to do is you want to kind of grow your own metric for what you what would be successful for you. And that is hard to do because we're kind of a barded with images and suggestions about what would make a successful person. But if you talk to people who seem to have success, you realize that you want to have a different metric. I spent some time with the Amish a lot of time with the Amish. It was really because because they had a very different measure of success for the Amish. What they're trying to use tech, one of the reasons how one of the ways that they decide which technology they're going to use or not use is they have a very clear idea of success. ([Time 0:25:48](https://share.snipd.com/snip/031ecc62-3715-477a-810f-195cdf8d9f37))
    - **Note:** Define success specific to you differentiate yourself. We model peoples outsides not their insides we need to define what success is to us. Don’t aim to be the best be the only. Internal locus of control.
- Unleashing Human Potential Through Equal Opportunity
  Key takeaways:
  - Equal opportunity and better tools can unleash human potential
  - Each person has a unique mix of personality, talent, and genius
  - Figuring out one's genius can take most of a lifetime
  - It is important to have support and community in discovering and expressing one's genius
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  I love that. It's beautiful. But I think we're all unleashed too. There's unleashing human potential by creating equal opportunity and creating better tools so that people's potential can shine through. Yeah.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah. We're all a different mix. Each one of us has a different face. We have a different personality face. We have a different talent face. And we each have our own genius. I truly believe that. And so what we want to do is arrange things so that you can arrive somewhere where you can actually express it. And I have to say that this is a very, very difficult thing. It's taking me most of my life to configure what I'm really good at. And I think most people, it just takes almost their entire life to kind of figure out where their genius is. There are some occasionally prodigies, people who have a very clear idea when they're very young exactly what it is. But for most people, we need our lives to kind of figure out what our lives are really about. And the other important part of that is we absolutely need everybody around us. ([Time 0:34:02](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4eb818d8-e9d0-4d8d-bde1-90a9f522efca))
    - **Note:** We need our lives to figure out what we’re good at and what we’re not and we need parents and guides along the way to help us figure out what we want. It’s a very hard question. Need others to point out our blind spot.
- Advice on Changing People's Minds: Listening and Understanding
  Key takeaways:
  - You can't reason someone out of a notion they didn't reason themselves into
  - Arguing with people is often unproductive
  - The best way to change someone's mind is to genuinely listen and understand their perspective
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  I love that beautiful. Again, it's about the group. I like that. There's a common theme here. One of your other pieces of advice was you can't reason someone out of a notion that they didn't reason themselves into.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, trying to argue. I mean, this is something I have learned to not do is argue with people. You know, I like to argue. You have to find someone who's arguingly authentically. You'll want you to learn. And for lots of people, that's not really the case. And so often we have things that we believe that we inherit or that we don't know why we believe or we certainly haven't arrived through logic. And so therefore, logic is not going to work. Another piece of advice to have about changing people's minds is I have found by far the best way to have any hope of changing someone's mind is to try and listen and understand, truly understand why they think what they were thinking, how they got there. And that conversation ([Time 0:36:03](https://share.snipd.com/snip/04a16a1a-15c9-42b6-94dc-402f3b679878))
    - **Note:** Don’t try to argue but the best way to change someone’s mind is to understand them at a fundamental level and their motivations ect. No one is irrational it’s just different interpretations and perspectives being cast on the world. Most harm is done in the name of eliminating evil.
- The Power of Kindness: Reaching Out Can Be the Most Selfish Thing You Can Do in the Long Term
  Key takeaways:
  - The sub theme of the book is about kindness, compassion, gratitude, ancient virtues.
  - Kindness is not weakness, but rather a strength and a power.
  - Cultivating kindness is cultivating a superpower.
  - Reaching out and helping others is the most selfish thing you can do in the long term.
  - Taking the long view of your own life and being kind can have greater benefits in the end.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Oh, yeah. And by the way, you know, the sub theme of the book, throughout the whole book is about kindness, compassion, gratitude, these kind of elemental, timeless, ancient virtues. So kindness is a kind of compassion. And it goes back to again, for me, in this kind of the weird paradox of the universe that kindness is not weakness because in fact, it's a strength. It's power. It's weak people, small people are unkind. You can be generous when you are confident and true and honest. And so cultivating kindness is cultivating a superpower. And so it's just kind of this, again, this really weird thing that reaching out, helping others is the most selfish thing you can do in the long term. So it's a little bit of long termism. And that's another thing that goes through is this idea that, yeah, for immediate payback, be angry, be snarky, whatever it is, but if you are patient, if you take the long view of your own life and what we're doing, it's very clear that you'll gain more in that way. So you can afford to be kind, give away something, give away your time, be humble, give away your own status, whatever it is. Because what I've seen among myself and other people is that you'll be rewarded more. ([Time 0:40:38](https://share.snipd.com/snip/17e0d401-cd91-4c8d-902b-d872414fba40))
    - **Note:** It’s selfish to be kind you’ll be rewarded more in the long run. Better ev for you. You feel better more good comes back. Take the 20 year long view with all your interactions changes how you think and do things.
- The Importance of Attending Funerals and Being Remembered for Who You Are
  Key takeaways:
  - Attending funerals can provide valuable insight into what really matters in life
  - People will remember the kind of person you were, not your achievements
  - Reflecting on what people will say at your funeral can be a sobering experience
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Okay, last piece of advice before we move on, which is before you are old, attend as many funerals as you can bear and listen. Nobody talks about that apart as achievements. The only thing people will remember is what kind of person you were while you were achieving.
  Speaker 1
  So that came from my attending funerals. It was just a hundred percent direct observation of the data where I was going to funerals and I was noticing this weird thing. And you know, then you kind of play forward. It was like, what are people going to say at my funeral? It was really sobering to, to reflect on that. And there was, you know, a couple of people who were prominent and I was just kind of maybe shocked or amazed that that's what people wanted to talk about was what they were like and what they did and their sense of humor and all these other things. And it wasn't about the trophies that they had at all or what they had even accomplished. And so that was for me like a wake-up call. ([Time 0:45:23](https://share.snipd.com/snip/25c3a6cf-838d-4eaf-b982-2ac4c23aaa88))
    - **Note:** At your funeral people don’t talk about what you did but who you were when you did it. Your character matters much more than your achievements.
- The Limitations of Artificial Intelligence: A Multi-Dimensional Approach
  Key takeaways:
  - Artificial intelligence is multi-dimensional and has multiple vectors
  - There are probably hundreds of different dimensions and types of cognition in our own minds
  - So far, AI has only synthesized pattern recognition and a little bit of generative ability
  - This flattened bottom-up approach to AI can take you much further than expected, but won't take you all the way to your goal
  - Wikipedia is a classic example of a bottom-up approach that eventually had to incorporate more top-down editorial control
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  No, I don't. I, I think we're still at day one. And so here's the thing about AI, artificial intelligence is, is that most people think of intelligence, including a lot of AI researchers as a single dimension, like a decibels IQ. It's multi-dimensional. There's multi-vectors. It's all gradient. None of it's binary. There's, there's, there's probably hundreds of different dimensions and different types of cognition in our own minds. And so far we've synthesized basically two varieties. A pattern recognition and a little bit of kind of generative ability. There's this logical deduction, you know, symbolic reason. None of these things have we come close to synthesizing. What's shocking to us is how far we can go with just these two things. And then, and they're, and they're very flattened kind of bottom up into this connectionist idea, which is like, yeah. And what I've learned from that is that that bottom up will take you much further than you thought you could go, but will never take you all the way to where you want to go. So Wikipedia, this classic bottom up thing, over time, there's a more and more top down editorial control. And eventually over time, there'll be even more to get where we want to get that kind of encyclopedia that's totally reliable. It does what we want to do. There's going to be some more top down control given to that bottom up power, but you can't get all the way just from the bottom up. ([Time 1:00:00](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4c47b6b2-e261-4236-b24a-4551101bebb1))
    - **Note:** You can’t get all the way bottom up you need some top down guidance. Wikipedia got very far bottom up but now have top down control as well to clean up the edges and get all the way there. The same thing may be true with AI
- Epistemology: The Frontier of How We Know Things
  Key takeaways:
  - The epistemological front is a significant and potent frontier that discusses how we know things and what we need to be convinced something is true.
  - There isn't a very scientific measurement or process to prove truth, as it's not just about the source but also requires verification and consensus.
  - The issue of disinformation goes beyond the election and is a fundamental problem at the core of what truth is and how we come to a consensus.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So I think this epistemological front that we've entered into is a very significant and very potent frontier, which is how do we know things? What do we need to be convinced something is true? Again, we have kind of like in our own past, sort of waved our hands. And though I know, I know, but what's this coming up to illuminate is in fact, we don't know, we don't really have a very scientific measurement for that or process. And so what this is illuminating is like, okay, Chachi P is making things up. Well, what would we need to believe that? Is it the source? Well, can we believe the source? How many levels do we need to go on three levels of footnotes or does need seven levels? Or do they have to be verified by something, some other AI? So this issue, I think is a really fundamental thing. It's not a trivial thing of disinformation for the election. No, no, it goes way beyond that. This is a really core thing at the level of what is truth. How do we, it's a consensus of some sort. How do we come to that consensus? And what are the different categories? Maybe there's different categories of things. There's maybe levels or varieties. I don't know. ([Time 1:02:49](https://share.snipd.com/snip/cd473907-b61e-47b8-b718-b8ae26f0cdc0))
    - **Note:** Ai will help us discern what us truth and epistemological truth. It’s tough to know what core truth is but AI will push us to further ask the question and fight for the answers. We’re changing how we decide we know things.
- The Vacuum of Belief in China and the Potential Rise of AI Religion
  Key takeaways:
  - China and Russia may be the first to adopt an AI religion due to a vacuum of belief systems
  - China lacks a religion, scripture, or constitution that its population believes in, leading to a hunger for a greater belief system
  - Humans have an instinct to be a part of something larger than themselves which, when unfulfilled, leads to unpredictable behavior
  - Nationalism serves as a belief system larger than oneself, leading to a rise of nationalism in China
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And let me say one last thing. And I would expect it to see these first in China and maybe Russia because they have a total vacuum of this. So here's the thing about China, which I spent a lot of time in. There's nothing to believe in. They don't have a religion to believe in. They don't have a scripture. They don't have a constitution that they believe in. There's only about making money and they, and that's not enough. And so they, there is this hunger for something to believe in. And if there was something like an AI religion that could sweep the country because of the vacuum of, you know, something greater than themselves to believe in.
  Speaker 2
  I think we missed the fact that as humans, we have this instinct to be a part of something larger than ourselves. And when that instinct is not fulfilled, it leads to all sorts of unpredictable behavior.
  Speaker 1
  Right, right, right. Exactly. So in absence of that, so nationalism is something bigger than yourself to believe in. And so that's why there's going to be a rise in China of nationalism. ([Time 1:10:16](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2e0b6e56-1e20-42cd-ac9f-370beab89589))
    - **Note:** Humans have a need to believe in things greater than themselves that have meaning and religion was this now something needs to take the place of religion to fill this hole of meaning. The purpose and meaning in your life should transcend you and be bigger than yourself.
