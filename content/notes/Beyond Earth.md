### Highlights

- large centralized projects create less change and take longer than many smaller projects that have the freedom to explore rapid advances without the scrutiny of modern standards of safety and other practices that eat money fast 
  competitors drive each other to create the best product and best ideas
- the limit to space exploration are not physical, they are economic and technical
  right now it seems crazy for most people to imagine a future where it would be useful, even necessary, to use space travel due to decreasing climate conditions on Earth, but it is a future that many scientists deem only a matter of time; think big; already conflicts and political tension arising from climate crisis (for example between Pakistan and India)
  years ago air travel was only for the ultra-wealthy and to casually fly across continents for a single meeting or vacation was insane, but today flying is just as normal as any other method of transportation; apply that to the future of space travel

    - **Note:** Things move faster and further beyond our imagination then we can even dream possible. Take your timeline of the future and compound it 5-10 fold. We overestimate what can happen in one year and underestimate in 10.
- the Iron Triangle: fast, better, and cheaper—but you can only have two and that is why a rushed project or one that cuts corners will ultimately fail at some point; spend the extra time, money, patience, get the expertise required because its better to spend an extra week or an extra million dollars if $450 million and years of work were already invested
  China’s office politics make is so that when they do fail at their projects, the public never knows about it; avoid any kind of public embarassement at all costs
