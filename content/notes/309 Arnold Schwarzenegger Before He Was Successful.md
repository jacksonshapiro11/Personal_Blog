### Highlights

- Arnold Schwarzenegger's Goal-Oriented Mindset Before Fame and Success
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And I was not a well balanced man and hated the very idea of an ordinary life. She thought that I would settle down, that I would reach the top in my field and then level off. But that's a concept that has no place in my thinking. For me, life is continuously being hungry. The meaning of life is not simply to exist, to survive, but it is to move ahead, to go up, to achieve and to conquer. I wanted to grow. I wanted to continue on. The life she wanted would not permit that. And so what this podcast is going to be about is this is Arnold before the fame before the success. Like this is the person that built the foundation upon which all his future success rests upon. Okay, so main theme of the book is that Arnold is the most goal oriented person that Barbara had ever met. And so I want to go right to where they meet Arnold's 21 years old at the time. He just got to America. He's living in Southern California and he's working with Joe Wieder. And so we see this list of goals that he makes for himself. So he has five exact goals that he wants to accomplish immediately. He wants to rent a one bedroom apartment near Gold's gym. He wants to acquire a motivating training partner. He needs to find a freelance writer to help him write his required articles for Joe's magazines. He needs to get access to a car. And he needs to get a raise for his salary from Joe. And so at the end of every chapter, you see the excerpts from this interview that Barbara does with Arnold when he's the governor of California, this is all the back in 2004.

    - **Note:** Arnold grew up with a demanding near abusive father who push him and his brother and pitted them against each other. Arnold spent his early life figuring out a way out he was always ambitious and wanted greatness. He wanted to come to the us and go from body builder to star. He start body building at 15 and got a model in his head of the most successful body builder at the time and wanted to replicate that. He got spotted by a talent agent at a mr universe and moved to LA. His girlfriend wrote this book and at the time thought Arnold just needed to become the best then he’d settle down but Arnold only took success as more fuel to his fire and it pushed him harder. He has a singular focus and clearness of clarity pick your path and burn the boats become and expert it frees you. If you do everything you will win - lbj. He was willing to work 2-3x more than all his competitors when they lifted once he did it 4 times a day. He had no distractions and saw this was his only way out. Singular focus and clarity.

  And then she's constantly like, no, do this other thing. He's like, I just told you, I'm going to focus like a machine, get to the top of bodybuilding. And then once I get there, I use that as a launch pad to get into movies and build my business empire. That is what I'm doing. That is what I'm obsessed with from the time my eyes open till the time I go to sleep. It is futile to make suggestions that are not that to me. And so what I'm describing to you is the reputation that Arnold has now, right? Everybody knows that. What's fascinating is he had that when he was 20. He had that when he was 21. He had that when he was 15. And I think the best description of this is there's a book I did a long time ago. It's a very popular with entrepreneurs. It's by this guy named Bill Walsh, who was maybe one of the greatest coaches of all time. I think it was like maybe episode 106 or something like that. A founder is called the score takes care of itself. And there's a line in there. There's a paragraph in that book that really aligns that champions behave like champions before they're champions. And we're seeing that with Arnold. And Bill Walsh says like the culture precedes positive results. It doesn't get tacked on as an afterthought on your way to the victory stand. Champions behave like champions before their champions. They have a winning standard of performance before they are winners. Arnold had a winning standard of performance before he was a winner. And the great thing about this perspective is we have a normal person by her own. She'll repeat that over and over and I just I'm a normal person. ([Time 0:17:01](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c598e9fd-f5ed-4922-8f60-ae08ad42b422))
    - **Note:** Performed proceeds results. Champions become champions before they’re champions bull Walsh. His girlfriend wanted to have a normal life and Arnold was manically focused on his success he wanted to be the best body builder in the world then the best actor he had no time to slow down and always fought being normal. He was disagreeable to stay on his path with no deviation. His girlfriend saw the world as something that happened Arnold saw the world as something you directed high agency very motivated individuals he grew up without running water he would never settle he needed to be the best in everything he did. His negative motivation pushed him to achieve his maximum level of his goals. He wanted to succeed at any cost and would work hard until he did.
- The Consistency and Charisma of Arnold Schwarzenegger
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  About a young Arnold to be in his presence was to fall under his spell he had that uncanny ability to connect immediately with anyone he chose and so that part reminded me of Steve Jobs Steve Jobs was known to have undeniable charisma and to have an intense presence Arnold had that too and the amazing thing is as you go through the years and through the pages and as you turn the pages Arnold gets older and yet he remains remarkably consistent he is smarter than he looks he understands the world runs our relationship so he cultivates them he's constantly using the way he grew up as fuel i love that that quote by the investor Josh Wolff that chips on shoulders put chips in pockets and he's always learning an oppression that our friend john offered of Arnold is that Arnold's mind is like a steel Trap Arnold had a knack for meeting unusual people Arnold always rooted for the underdog success the underdog had to fight for himself just like Arnold had to fight for himself to get out of Austria and so even though Arnold's working in real estate he's got a construction company like this bricklayer company he's working out five hours a day he's doing a bunch of media work for joe weeder he's continuing to train he's creating his own products he's doing seminars he's also constantly taking classes he's always learning he had steadily accrued undergraduate credits from Santa Monica college his vocabulary expanded by several thousand ([Time 0:29:38](https://share.snipd.com/snip/94d0377a-e58d-4723-88fe-ae42f6ad84ee))
    - **Note:** Arnold was always learning and enrolled in college despite having a job and being a full time body builder so he could master the English language better. He understood the importance of a network and cultivating relationships and would be invited to his exs house long after they broke up because her family liked him so much. He was extremely gregarious and affable and always understood deeply the importance of making friends and cultivating a network. He was always learning and constantly listening and growing from others. His older brother and father died when Arnold was young when his mom came and visited it was clear he still needed her approval to disprove the preconceptions of failure his family had for him.
- The Importance of Optimism and a Sunny Disposition

  Speaker 1
  Another good idea from Arnold is the fact that he always spun everything for the positive he was constantly like barbara would run into like a problem we talked about this over and over again because the famous uh quote from henry kizer that uh opportunity problems are just opportunities and we're close i think a lot of normal people they like let themselves get down uh or they get you know upset about something and arnold would like laugh it off he'd be like you have nothing to worry about there's he repeat like there's always a solution every problem there's always a way out just keep going forward and so when i just got to this one line he just says he always spun things for the positive i thought of two quotes that i absolutely love one from my personal hero edwin land he says optimism is A moral duty that is such a great line optimism is a moral duty that edwin lam repeated it so much that when you read biographies of them he has these statements like a lot of founders they identify a handful of principles or maxims that they repeat over and over again and the repeat them so frequently that you know they become jeffism's in the case of like jeff bezos inside amazon he had there's a bunch of these and inside polaroid there was landisms and and optimism is a moral duty was one of the landisms there's another quote that i thought of from actually comes from andrew carneries autobiography when i got to this part and he says that a sunny disposition is worth more than a fortune young people should know that it can be cultivated that the mind like ([Time 0:32:28](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fd37786c-b8c3-4caf-8ac0-88308cd8a803))
    - **Note:** Arnold always stayed positive. Lande saw optimism as a moral duty and carnige said a sunny disposition is worth a fortune there is immense value in a good attitude. You can get out of the shade an into the sun mentally and physically. Arnold understood the importance of media and marketing/ promoting your work. He became a millionaire in real estate and this gave him the ability to only be in the movie roles he wanted. He was the most goal oriented person ever his motivation was legendary he would rather die than give up. He owned a multi family complex at 26 after saving up but his drive never relented. Arnold believed he could learn anything great jobs are neither decreed nor degrees but the result of continuous learning in free markets - naval. He learned from the best of the past and had a phd in charisma.

  Olympia and star of the pumping of pumping iron and joseph kennedy's granddaughter maria shriver were an item and this is barber's response okay i had to sit down to understand the nature of his colossal climb he had now marked new territory and hyannis point his girlfriend laid claim to kennedy royalty and so this mistake this mistake of continually underestimating and therefore being surprised of a formidable individual like Arnold continues as i what this is many decades like a decade maybe a decade and a half after they broke up as i watched Arnold's film credits mount throughout the 80s i became stupefied over his success in hollywood i found it steadily strange to realize i had known him prior to such staggering fame and wondered if i should have been smarter or wiser in being able to predict his legendary outcome i knew that he would Become an outstanding businessman but this and i think that is one of the greatest things about reading biographies of great people hopefully one of the things that you're getting out of listening to this podcast is not only can we know that we know a ([Time 0:43:09](https://share.snipd.com/snip/14252f71-984e-4591-be79-a22ed64de138))
    - **Note:** As Arnold grew he changed and his friends started to bad mouth him and tear him down behind his back these weren’t his genuine friends but they would still show up when Arnold asked. After 5+ years the relationship ended she couldn’t think Arnold would become this she constantly underrated him as a formidable individual which was a big mistake. We can not only spot but build ourselves into formidable individuals.
