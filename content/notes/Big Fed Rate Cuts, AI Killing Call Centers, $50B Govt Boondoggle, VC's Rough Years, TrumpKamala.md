- Leverage Data and AI to Disrupt Customer Support
  Summary:
  A vast amount of non-proprietary data exists in the form of product documentation and historical customer support interactions, making it ideal for training AI models for customer support applications.
  As foundation models advance rapidly, startups in this space are reaching high valuations, but the challenge remains in capturing the value before commoditization occurs. Focusing on the most regulated and error-sensitive areas may provide opportunities for customization and differentiation.
  Companies like Klarna demonstrate the potential of AI to create tailored solutions by observing and reverse-engineering existing systems, suggesting that traditional systems of record, once considered untouchable, are now vulnerable to disruption through intelligent automation.
  This shift requires technical prowess and decisive leadership, as the move away from expensive, monolithic software systems toward bespoke in-house solutions could lead to substantial cost savings.
  However, skepticism remains regarding the replicability of such efforts on a larger scale without significant specialization and development of usable frameworks.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Go ahead, Saks, and then I'll show you what so yeah One of the reasons why I'm bullish on this customer support use case is because there's a very large data set to train on You've got all Of the product documentation that companies very created. You've got all the previous email Support, you know, so and calls. Yeah, the calls have been recorded so you can now train the AI on that So there's a very large body of data to train the AI model on. And it's not necessarily the most proprietary. It's not like dealing with people's medical records or even confidential legal documents, something like that. So the data is readily available. And then the foundation models are getting really good. I think there's a big question here about value capture, which is there's a number of startups now that are becoming very highly valued, that are chasing this disruption, this sort Of customer support agent disruption, and they're getting into very high valuations, even unicorn valuations already. And the question is, well, wait, if the foundation models are advancing at such a rate, like a year from now, why couldn't it like a developer, just a startup of a few guys take next year's Model, train it and then commoditize the.
  Speaker 3
  Trying to figure out what applications we would build, and which sectors of the economy we would go after. I was like, guys, we gotta go after the hardest, most regulated places. Because those are the things and places and people that have absolutely zero tolerance for error and where you're going to need to do some amount of customization and specialization Actually solve these problems. And it sacks to your point, like when you see, and I said, we cannot touch customer service, we cannot touch it because it's going to get commoditized and run over by these foundational Models within a year. Right.
  Speaker 2
  I mean, it's just too easy.
  Speaker 1
  You'll be able to deploy these. It's just too easy. You'll be able to do it on a local computer. I mean, you'll just download the entire database and a recall on a MacBook with an M3. And by the way, just to build on that.
  Speaker 3
  The other thing that's now possible, and you saw this with Klarna because Klarna put out this like cryptic tweet slash press release where I think maybe it was in their earnings. Nick, maybe you can find this where they're like, we've deprecated Salesforce and Workday. That was strange. How can a company that big deprecate those two systems of record? How is that even, it's, how is it possible? So they're writing their own, right? Well, I'll tell you how it's possible. And so this is like this next crazy thing that's been happening. We've been doing a version of this to go after some other sources of software. We haven't had the balls, to be honest, to go after SINs or Workday. But here's how they do it. They write these agents, and these agents can spawn other agents. So it's a very classic kind of machine that builds a machine. And you start to observe the inputs and outputs of a system. I'm hyper-simplifying, but it'll make the point. And over time, what the agents start to do is by observing the inputs and the outputs, they start to guess on what the intervening code is. And the code paths must be in the middle to generate the outputs based on these inputs. And so over time, what happens is you develop a digital twin. And then you run that against that counterfactual against Workday or Salesforceforce, and then at some point you're like, it's the same. And then you just turn it off. And you're saving yourself tens or hundreds of millions of dollars. So that's, it's a version of what Klarna did. It takes an enormous amount of technical strength to do it. It also takes tremendous, I think, executive courage and leadership because I think that's a very difficult decision to embark on. But if you're an engineer, that must be an unbelievably exciting technical challenge to be a part of. But that's the basic premise of what they were able to do. Hopefully, they share more and maybe they even open source what they did, because I think it would just be an amazing thing for all of us to look at.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, I mean to to restate it, watch people use a piece of software. And then based on what they do, you could write a code which you could take a video of a video game today, like Angry Birds and somebody this, you give the Angry Birds iPad game from 15 years Ago to AI, it's going to back into the code just by watching it. So why not just watch people use Salesforce or Workday? And those are very expensive products, thousands of dollars per user, right? I want to get Sax's point of view.
  Speaker 3
  Like the thing in enterprise software that we were always told is you cannot touch these systems of record. Don't ever start a systems of record company. Don't try to touch these systems of record companies. Don't try to disrupt them. It's an impossible task. But then the question is, if you have these things, why do you necessarily need a system of record in the way that you needed to before when you're writing all this clunky deterministic.
  Speaker 2
  Well, I saw the clarinets story where they said they were gonna rip out Salesforce and and workday because they're able to write their own bespoke code using AI. I mean, I have to say I'm a little bit skeptical of that story for a couple of reasons. One is, if that's their goal, why wouldn't they have open sourced these products they created? You might as well get the whole ecosystem working on it because they're not trying to sell this product that they've internally created. They're just trying to rip out the cost so why not let the whole ecosystem see it? The other thing is if it's so easy to do, why hasn't the marketer even flooded with new startups that are effectively able to reverse engineer?
  Speaker 3
  I don't think you're right. I don't think it's easy to do because I don't think there's a generalization here that's productizable. Do you know what I mean? Like I do think that these are very custom specific things. So maybe there's like some scaffolding, but I don't think that that scaffolding has a ton of economic value. I think it's really good open source stuff. Yeah, I think it's what you build on top of it. And so that hasn't been figured out yet for sure.
  Speaker 2
  Yeah, look, I think that if you're only using a few use cases of these big complicated software packages, then yeah, it's probably easier than ever to deprecate them, eliminate them From your stack and just have your own internal engineers build specifically what you need in a more tightly integrated way. I think that is possible. ([Time 0:25:24](https://share.snipd.com/snip/df53be93-4953-4978-918e-178cca59685e))

- Beware the $50 Billion Mirage
  Summary:
  The allocation of nearly $50 billion for rural broadband and electric vehicle charging stations under the 2021 infrastructure bill highlights significant government waste, inefficiency, and political biases.
  Despite these massive allocations, no meaningful progress has been achieved, with rural broadband access remaining nonexistent and only a handful of EV chargers built. Meanwhile, the private sector, exemplified by Starlink and major airlines, has already provided solutions at a fraction of the cost.
  The problem is compounded by government incompetence, corruption, and political retaliation, especially against independent solutions that do not align with current administration interests.
  This cycle of wasting taxpayer money for politically motivated reasons not only hinders progress but also perpetuates a culture of negligence regarding fiscal responsibility.
  The persistent lack of accountability and media scrutiny allows such issues to go unchecked, leading to a desensitization toward colossal sums of wasted public funds. The current environment, characterized by tribal politics, diverts focus from effective governance to partisan conflicts, ultimately undermining the intent of public programs designed to support constituents. A shift towards celebrating fiscal responsibility and transparency in governance is necessary to prevent future waste of public resources and ensure accountability within government spending.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So let's go for it. In related news of our government burning our money, rural broadband, rural broadband and EV charging, $42 billion and $7.5 billion, almost $50 billion combined. Let's just go over these two programs real quickly here. Both were part of the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill in 2021, $42 billion carved out to provide high speed internet to people living on farms in rural occasions, $7.5 billion carved Out to build 500,000 EV chargers over 10 years. It's been a thousand days since the bill was passed, so let's check on the progress. Zero people have been connected, according to FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, and eight. One two three four five six seven eight EV chargers have been built as of May, according to AutoWeek magazine, what's even crazier. Private industry already solved these problems. United Airlines just announced they're putting Starlink on a thousand of their planes and they're going to offer it for free. And Starlink now has 2,500 planes under contract with a bunch of other airlines. And in the second half of 2023 alone, the private sector built over 1000 charging stations in the US. These are two problems that have already been solved sex. Why are we burning $50 billion in the future with things that have already been solved? We've solved for this. I own electric cars. I have the answer.
  Speaker 3
  You know, the answer. Say the answer.
  Speaker 1
  Graft. Keep going. I mean, you tell me. Corruption, graft, buying votes from your constituents? They haven't delivered any of it. Incompetence, yes.
  Speaker 2
  Well, there's a couple of things going on here. So one is typical government, waste, fraud, and abuse, where they've allocated $42 billion for rural internet, haven't hooked anyone up, and we could spend a fraction of that giving People Starlink and allowing the private sector to do its job.
  Speaker 1
  And why even pay for its tax? Why are we paying for it if it's available for 100 bucks?
  Speaker 2
  That's the baseline, but it's worse than that because on top of the waste, fraud, and abuse, and the fact that the government is grossly incompetent and inefficient, you also have naked Political retaliation going on here. That's the answer. Yeah, exactly. And Brendan Carr, who's an FCC commissioner, pointed this out. He said that in 2023, the FCC canceled or revoked an $885 million contract with the company by claiming Starlink is not capable of providing high speed internet. Then a year later, of course, that was a lie. That's a lie. FCC is now claiming that Starlink provides so much high speed internet that the word monopoly should be, uh, tossed out. Yeah. So look, this is just pure, it's pure naked retaliation. The, the Biden Harris administration doesn't want to admit that Elon has the best solution for rural internet, just like they couldn't admit he made the best electric cars. Remember when they did that EV summit and they didn't invite him? That was just nakedly political because he's not on their team. Right. So look, I mean, the Biden-Harris administration, look, it's blue no matter who. And Elon has drifted from being sort of independent and not aligned to... He was blue. He was blue.
  Speaker 1
  Let's call him what it is. I mean, he voted for Hillary and Obama, he said.
  Speaker 2
  He's no longer team blue. And so they're punishing him for this. Yeah. And it's costing taxpayers a huge amount of money. I think this is one of the worst decisions by the current administration. And if Trump gets in there, he should reverse it on day one.
  Speaker 1
  Well, we need to investigate. I mean, I think how we got to the point of wasting $50 billion, that requires an investigation, I think. Chamath, your thoughts?
  Speaker 3
  One comment is, and this is so sad, but I'm so desensitized by the amount of waste that I don't know whether 50 billion is a lot or a little anymore when it comes to the United States government. Isn't that sad? Like, because now everything I hear is normal. It's hundreds of billions and trillions, but 50 billion is an enormous amount of money, right? Well, that's a good point.
  Speaker 2
  I remember, you know, back in the day, 60 minutes used to do these segments on waste, fraud, and abuse at the Pentagon, different parts of the government. $42 billion just spent on something that really taxpayers could have for free or without the government getting involved. And $42 billion that was lining someone's pocket when the service doesn't even work, that would have been a scandal. And the media would have covered it. But the media doesn't even cover it these days. And again, it's because the media has become so tribal that it's better dead than red and blue, no matter who. And so because the media would have to admit that Elon's already solved this problem, they just can't go there. They won't even cover this. And so we have no accountability. There's no accountability on the government.
  Speaker 3
  If I had to just take a step back and just generalize going forward, do we want to live in the kind of administrative state where they will pick people that they dislike based on totally Random criteria, a tweet, a meme, a post, and then all of a sudden punish a bunch of the rest of us because of that. They're punishing all of America because they collect our taxes to waste on it. And then they punish the people that they actually say they're going to uplift by not delivering what they promised. And if you take Elon out of it for a second, the problem was when we crossed the chasm and did it with the first guy, him. But the reality is there's only one of him and then there's a lot of the rest of us. And what will happen is people just get added to this list of folks that certain nameless faceless people in the administrative state dislike. And what happens is the country slows down, and the country wastes money, and the country pilfers it away. And that has to stop. And so what really bothers me about these things is A, I don't know how to undecensitize myself to the fact that all of a sudden now, because of just all of this sloppy waste, I didn't react As much as I should have to just $50 billion being flushed on the toilet on these two projects. And then two, Jason, your point, it is a solved problem that you can give incredibly cheaply. And the fact that it's not left to private enterprise to solve this. Instead, it's just brazen partisanship combined with retaliation combined with incompetence. ([Time 0:33:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/25cee564-a4c3-4c07-837e-da2acf1e56d0))
