    - **Note:** There’s doing a transaction which is the execution of the transaction and the info about the transaction which is the data so data availability allows for the modular thesis where execution is split from consensus and data is posted somewhere else. Celestia allows for more data to be posted cheaper enabling more roll up use cases that are more computationally intensive allows for more scale. Data availability sampling allows for decentralized way to post and verify data with lite not full nodes. Means more people can verify the chain.
