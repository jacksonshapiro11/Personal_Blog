- Summary: Arnold Bennett's essay emphasizes that most people do not use their 24 hours a day effectively and often feel dissatisfied with their lives. He encourages readers to recognize that they already have enough time but need to manage it better by prioritizing important activities. Starting with small, consistent efforts can lead to a more fulfilling and engaged life.
