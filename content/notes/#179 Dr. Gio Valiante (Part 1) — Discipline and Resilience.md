  Everyone loves to hit the driver at the driving range because it goes far. But if you paid attention to Tiger Woods during his run, his epic run, and you watched him practice, Tiger Woods would camp out over three foot puts for hours. So much so that if you went to the putting green, out at a aisle worth country club where he lived, at the end of the day, you would see the imprints where his feet were and the line that the Ball tracked from where he was to the hole, he would hit so many three foot putts that it would burn the grass out. And you look at his track record, he didn't win those 80 something events with his driver. His statistics from three or four feet at end, that's what won it was the love of doing the boring stuff. And the equivalent is swimming as people practice their flip turns, right? Everyone wants to practice their stroke and all the fun stuff. But like find time in the flip turn. So the inversion that happens of people who are willing to outwork the competition, right? And effort. So again, go to the five ways to win. Number one is talent. Number two is work ethic. It's like, I'm, you know, I'm gonna, I'm gonna close the gap by outworking people. Now, where magic happens, and I think people use Michael Jordan as an example, is when you marry the two. He's the best and he worked the hardest. Like, now that's, you know, the most talent, you know, married with the most effort is, is, you know, can become legendary. Now, the third way to win is to have a differentiated perspective, right? To sort of see the world differently. And I'll give an example of a differentiated perspective. I'll give a couple of examples, I guess. So now here we are in August, and it's a good time in a lot of parts of the world, you know, to go look at the night sky. If you're a star gaze, or like, you know, now's a good window. But when I look up at the stars, which I did with my kids this weekend, I see the big dipper. And Van Gogh looked at the same stars and he saw Starry Night, right? So the looked at thing is the same. That's the objective. But the subjective interpretation, the subjective experience is where people can separate themselves. So for example, if you look at college football, look at three sort of Hall of Fame coaches. You've got Nick Saban, Urban Meyer, and Steve Spurrier. Nick Saban generally views football as an arms race for talent. Just recruit the best character and the best athletes and stack your team with talent and then coach the heck out of it. So he's a wonderful coach, no question about it. But he and Bill Belichick were really, really early on profiling players and knowing how to get the best players in the building. So talent, recruiting is a way to win in college football. But then get a guy like Steve Spurrier. If you look at the rankings of recruiting classes, Steve would always make jokes like, you know, we never have the best recruiting class, but why are we always winning? Well, Steve Spurrier saw football as a game of space. So he would recruit a quarterback, had good decision making, and receivers. And essentially what he tells quarterbacks is, you know, the field is a multi-dimensional thing. And here's the clock and just throw the ball into space and let the receiver run under it. And it worked 10 SEC championships, a national championship, hall of fame. Well, then you get a guy like Urban Meyer. And Urban Meyer came into the college football scene. And his success was, I mean, it was jarring how he would take programs and how quickly they would win. And on some level, and I'm being a little bit simplistic here, but Urban Meyer sees it as a foot race. It's a game of speed. And so at every position, if you're going to play for Urban Meyer, you better love to run whether you're an offensive lineman, defensive lineman, court, like you have to run. So again, you've got you've got three college football coaches, one sees this game of talent, one sees it as a game of spacing, one sees it as a game of speed. They're all looking at the same game, but it's a differentiated perspective. And that differentiated perspective can really unlock a lot of different things. If you ever read a book called Go Fast, Be Good and Have Fun by Bodie Miller, you can understand like how he was so successful, but like, he doesn't look at skiing, never looked at skiing As technique. He just saw it as speed. So essentially what he says is, I put my skis on the hill, and I just feel speed in my feet. And like, I just try to find the speed, whatever my body does, it does. That's a differentiated perspective. And it happens in the markets, right? Some people see it as, you know, if I could be faster to a trade, some people see it as, as a game of slugging. And slugging is a statistic in the markets where it's not how frequently you're right, but it's how big your bets are when you're right. Right.

    - **Note:** Master what everyone thinks is boring. Differentiated perspective. Big edge talent hard work differentiation process hire well and possibly luck. We are what we repeatedly do our habits. Identify people and hire well for your deficiencies. You canâ€™t change fixed traits you need to change malleable traits. Discipline is a way to delay gradafication howvdo we instill that properly in people. You need to change bad habits instantly and if itâ€™s going well donâ€™t relapse because then you restart. Be a student of yourself go all in change behavior and do it every day. Environment shapes behavior. Big things in psychology are thoughts feelings and actions.

  Speaker 1
  So there's a great book called The Talent Code by a friend of mine named Daniel Coel. And what Daniel did is he did a deep dive into what he calls talent hop eds. So he went to the places that seemed to produce disproportionate talent. So he went to the areas in Russia that were turning out champion tennis players. And he went to South Korea where all these great female golfers were coming from. And he went to the Dominican Republic where they're turning out these incredible young baseball players and a place in Texas that was turning out incredible musicians. And he was looking for the, he was looking for the commonalities like these talent hop eds. You know, if you think of Vango and his group of artists, like what wasn't about that time and space that was able to create so many great impressionists. And what he uncovered was really interesting and unforeseen. One of the common factors that produces disproportionate talent is what he identified with their two. One of them is called primal cues. Primal cues is that these places tend not to be identified by wealth and comfort. They tend to be the opposite. They tend to be places where the signaling of the community is like you better find a way to make it work. In other words, if this doesn't work out for you, like there's no plan B. Like your next best option isn't that good. You know, it's like growing up in a coal mining town. It's like it's the old American Horatio Alger stories or John Mellon camp song. It's like you grow up in an environment and then all of a sudden that environment gives you an opening and an option. And like you're going to shoot that gap and these things get triggered in the brain and the body that are called primal cues. Now it's not that your life is in danger, but like this is high-stakes stuff. And so what that does is it sharpens focus. It allows the brain to what's called myelinated so that memory and skill development, the velocity of skill development happens more quickly. One of the test questions I used to put on the sports psychology exams for my college students, I would say why is it that a golfer from from Iowa Country Club or Olympia High School has Never made it to the PGA tour. And these are very affluent places where you go to the driving range and these kids have the best instructors in the world, most modern equipment, brand new golf balls hitting off perfect Grass. And what you see is they is this scenario dominates junior golf in junior tennis and junior, but as the developmental trajectory goes, the game tends to weed these people out because They don't have the resilience and the grit and the fortitude because they were the formative years happened in such comfort that when things get hard, they don't know what to do with Them. So one of the profiles of these talent hotbeds is they tend to be places soccer, like Brazilian, Brazilian soccer is another example, where you have to tend to gut it out and it's some Version of natural selection where innovation and evolving your game, knowing yourself and skill development are at a premium.

    - **Note:** Profiles of talent hot beds come from places with no good option b so they need to be gritty and resilient in times of stress or theyâ€™re ducked vs growing up wealthy you can fall back on something good. Resilience and delayed gratification are key to success. Normalize failure to grow through it. Itâ€™s healthy for forests to get burned overprotection is a bad thing. Crisis and opportunity are synonymous you lose the baggage which frees you in a way. Gives you freedom to create and take risks. Freedom = nothing left to lose. Great success often comes from the ashes of great failure. We need to fail. People need the confidence in themselves to solve hard L problems to be successful. Belief comes before achievement run through failure. When youâ€™re confident and believe in your agency you stay at it longer and solve more problems than people who have less and give up more quickly. Reinforce work ethic and allow kids to believe in themselves to be better. Praise effort not intelligence
