### Highlights

- John Dewey education never stops and should continue long after school. Things are to be explained by their place in the environment. Modern era when things are understood not by theology but biology and science. Thought is instrument of readaptation. Philosophy is how we can synthesize sensation and desire to control the world. Thinking is social and a product of society. Nurture > nature no limit to change or growth just our minds. The process of perfection is the meaning of life not being good but constantly taking steps to be better is the meaning of life. To be good requires active learning ignorance isn’t bliss. Pursuit of good is meaning you need to be good and intelligent we need to shape our fates. Free will is illuminating conduct by knowledge. More development makes unclear ends but pursuit of more science is better than going back to dark ages more we control and know the better life is. Argues as democracy the best of all the worst governments. Must apply science to social problems not the metaphysical phase of social science we are in now. Global world. We must meet each problem with a hypothesis not a general theory. Not large models but specific experiments. Philosophy should be bottoms up not top down. Philosophy and its goal is to adapt to the questions and challenges of the day.

    - **Note:** constant learning; things are understood in context and by experiment not justified belief. The mind is constantly adapting to the world. The flexible are the ones that survive who can deal with change; antifragile humans. Philosophy is combination of sensation and desire. Life is an active process and we learn by doing; we are fallible but moving closer to the truth. Life is a dance of perfecting it. The good life is one you shape. Philosophy should adapt to the times and be bottoms up using the critical approach; apply scientific thinking to the world and social science
      Critical approach, life is a process that we shape with agency; remain flexible keep learning and adapt to challenges; problems are inevitable and soluble
- Consciousness is a system of relationships William James argues for pragmatism. Argues truth is the cash value of the good. Truth is a process. A philosophy cannot run counter to our hopes and also needs an object to press against or a goal. Tough minded vs tender minded philosophy and Argues for pluralistic theism thinks monotheism is not effective. Argues there are many philosophies abs we take on whichever helps us most and in this pluralism it doesn’t matter what we believe there are many ways to truth. Very open minded to ideas. Individualism everything should serve the individual. Choose the philosophy with the most utility. American idea for movement and acquisition inherent in philosophy

    - **Note:** Truth is a process and a philosophy needs to run with not counter to our goals. We need to lend from the different philosophies that work for us as there are many and none is right so we need to chop and change what works. Open minded individualistic and utilitarian.
- George Santayana is constantly critical all he is sure of is the sensation of the moment. Balance realism and idealism doesn’t reject the world or sensations has not being real accepts when sees in front of him is probably real. Reason is what is justified by fruits and consciousness it’s the marriage of impulse and ideation. There is nothing immortal the spirit of the world passes through us to grant us for a short period of time life. Psychology graduates to science when it seeks the mechanical not metaphysics behind events. Argues for people as automiton and were behaviorist. Argues that the symbolism in religion is vital and taking it literally has destroyed religion and civilizations alike. Argues for the importance of reason in the world through philosophy religion was able to create this idea but can we also do it through philosophy. One works government as the best way to live paying for safety is important but giving something up is natural too much chaos is bad. Argues for importance of leisure. To live one must embrace life as well as contemplate death and withdrawing from life is a bad philosophy. Disillusionment is beginning of philosophy not the end the end is happiness focusing on your navel is not an end but a means the end is happiness.

    - **Note:** Reason is the product of impulsive ideation/critical approach . Nothing is immortal. We’re given our spirit for a temporary amount of time. Importance of leisure and being bored embrace life don’t run from it. Disillusionment is the beginning of philosophy. Enlightenment is the end. Argues for importance of reason.
- Benedetto Croce lost his parents and only sister in an earthquake he instead of turning to faith turned the money he got in compensation into a library for philosophy. Croce looks for universals not practicals. Rejects religion and freedom of will but not immortality of soul. History is the art of choosing the best of many lies ie prior accounts of history. Dont distort history or think there’s a plan but see causes consequences and correlation benefit to see our current ideas in history to guide us today thats its benefit. Art is the particular knowledge is either intuitive or logical knowledge from imagination or intellect individual vs universal things vs relation between things of images or concept. Origin of art is in the ability to form images. Art is created when you imagine and even before you reason. Motionless conception of the idea is the art the externalization is just mechanical technique or skill. Art is internal. Beauty is mental formation of image that captures the essence of what is perceived inward image and outward forms. Art is internal we express our own mental intuition that creates art and beauty in our mind beauty is adequate expression of internal ideas.

    - **Note:** Art is an internal thing expressed externally. History is perspective the best of many lies synthesis. Looked for universals over particulars. History provides valuable perspective as it repeats and there is correlation over time. Cause and effect of history. Knowledge initiative vs logical. From imagination or intellect. Relationship between things vs concepts. Art is in the mind not the physical representation the that’s mechanical reverse compression algo. Art and beauty are mental not physical concepts.
- Bergson had the courage to doubt where the doubters piasly agreed. Fight against materialism time hold the essence of life it is an accumulation of its duration. The past endures and we think with our past. To exist is to become and change. Life is time and duration. Consciousness is when a being can rehearse before actually responding. Living being is sum of contingency. Creative force redirected action. This is free will. Memory understands past and present to make the best decision not deterministic but free will. Choice is tough requires mental work but we’re not automiton. Life is a matter of change not space or matter. Life is not in any thing or moment but in the passing of moments weaved together. Reflective thought isn’t the peak but presence and living in the dance of life is the peak. Our mental region isn’t just intellect but includes conscious and unconscious states. Internal intelligence design pushing on in the face of inhertia universe is at rest life runs against that. Evolution gives more success to the more energy efficient structure that takes the most risk. Persistent creative life and quest for more life is god. Don’t doubt what life can can achieve we generally achieve more and are more powerful than we realize. When we prove or disprove a philosophy we offer a fallible hope and the hope that survives longer is closer to truth. In criticism we get closer to truth.
- Nitzche strength over goodness resoluteness over pride genuis above masses argues against democracy and for power over justice argues against altruism. He was raised by his mom loved religion dad died young but then became disillusioned with he rejected religion. He worshiped the soldier but never became one because he didn’t want to and wasn’t in great health. Will to war and power was his philosophy but he never fought he was a nurse during the war and even in that he was queasy and got sent home. Wanted to reshape morals through evolution and elevate genius over man. Morality is in power/ strength not kindness and the ideal man is the Superman or perfect man superior individual over average person curate eugenics breed the best together don’t give the best people a choice. Energy intellect and pride the Superman is hard on himself pushes for personal growth. Argues against democracy christianity and equality for great men and power games. He argues men are above women but there are some relative female powers and male powers that need to be balanced. Believes in great men aristocracy not market and economic freedoms. Nitzhe fought against the morals of his age which led to him asking really good questions even if his ethic isn’t accepted nowadays and a bit crazy sometimes you need to shake the snow globe ask crazy questions to make progress change perspective. He was driven crazy committed to asylum because no one believed in his ideals genius but also not accepted went crazy.

    - **Note:** he had some crazy ideas which are always worth entertaining. power over justice. worshiped raw power. Morality of power and the super man is a superiorly bred individuals who should be selectively bred. The super man values growth and he beleifs in the great man theory of history. Fought the relative morality of his age. Disillusioned.
- Ethics is based on morals. Conduct is moral the more it creates a better more integrated society more positive sum. Morality is unity in diversity. Morals are all relative to time and society, but there is a concept of pleasure and pain. Inate moral sense. Argues against war but must be realized by individuals wanting it rather than or on them. Humans are better with freedom but they must realize and accept this freedom. Argues for self determination humans can do whatever they want if they don’t impede on anyone else. Equality of opportunity not outcomes. For young people benefits must be inefficient because they produce less than they consume, but with age that discrepancies close where better allocators get more resources. Liberty over evolution state must protect justice but this hurts worse people. Right to life liberty, and pursuit of happiness above all. Goes for egoism over altruism. Pursuit of individual happiness maximizes societal happiness. Spencer was too theoretical at times. Spencer’s issue was that he didn’t investigate where he might be wrong. His issue in his psychology is he doesn’t align thought with behavior well enough and that’s the entire point of psychology. Spencer and his industrial views did not really see or exploitation which was a big issue in industrialism and still is today.

    - **Note:** Morality is based by its utility. Argues for active freedom and active optimism. Humans are free for self-determination, but shouldn’t be equal. Maximize societal, happiness and human agency for self-determination.
- Life is the adjustment of internal relations to external relations. Life cannot be described in just physical chemical terms because there’s a dynamic aspect to it. We are always adapting to our environment. There is an inverse relationship to intelligence or energy, expenditure and fertility in one aspect you give, and the other you get. Spencer is Rich in theory and poor in proofs classic philosophy tendency to avoid. Instinct and reason are the same and reason is what I selected for overtime has the instinctive clear response in situations. Will is the sum of our active impulses action is the last stage of an idea emotion is the first stage of an instinctual response. Spencer over generalizes. A social organism is like society and that grows overtime and gets more complex. Life is immense in length compared to components and get more integrated and complex overtime. Argues a lot of beliefs, were previously formed from religious ideals, and we go for more militaristic to more collective industrial but overall structurally it’s similar with slight differences in flavor/application. Argues against one and a one world society to do this. World becomes more creative and cooperative positive sum state helps people not people helping state. Argues against socialism. Thinks it’s more aristocratic government first not individuals this restrictive on personal freedom is what makes socialism bad. People get rewarded for taking risks and supplying demand creates the most value over time even if painful. Or just for higher evolution of society from force compliance to voluntary.

    - **Note:** Life is adjusting your internals to externals your perception to your reality. Life is dynamic we are always growing and adapting. Instinct is reaction and reason is what is selected for over time. Will is the sum of our active impulses that starts with an instinct and ends with an emotion. Society and people get more complex over time = entropy. Religion influences a lot of our current beliefs. Religion guides a lot of thought and current instituions from path dependence. World as a complex adaptive system where the state helps the people. Hates socialism and things that risk taking and free markets is how you have success over the long term. Compliance over force creates more. Will Durant quote all systems need a profit motive to drive it incentives
- Much of our experience, whether religious or scientific ultimately boils down to us, not knowing what’s at its core we don’t know what created God much like we don’t know what under lies an atom as society gets more complex what lies at the heart of science gets even more confusing like psychology you can’t even point to what matter is there’s no good distillation. All knowledge is relative. Recognition is beginning of philosophy and religion. Philosophy goal is to completely unify knowledge. Evolution is the integration of matter from homogeneity to heterogeneity combining parts to a larger hole. The state organizes people that provides protection trade-offs. Evolution going from desperate parts to connect while increasing unity whatever is going from complexity to simplicity is against evolution evolution is the march of order in the world. The world goes into cycles then energy goes down order diffuses leads to death. Evolution and dissolution. He saw so far ahead that he lost all attachments to the moment and joy for life. Opinion is how character adapts itself to external arrangements. Opinion forms agency that leads to a collective force that drives social changes. We are a product of the times, and sometimes our opinion ahead or behind descendent of the past parent of the future. we are agency is we an unknown cause produces beliefs that act through us and thus change the world. We should always express the highest truth that becomes evident to us. That is how we take up our place in the world by fearlessly speaking our mind that’s how we drive change even if personally we fail will be a part ofa greater success. It’s OK if you affect the change you want and if not so well for trying.

    - **Note:** The only way to live is to speak your mind and try to make an impact on the world. The meaning of philosophy is were so lost in the vast ocean of life we don’t know what’s what and use philosophy to integrate and understand the world through science or religion. Science and religion are the same they both help us understand the world one is just more empirical. Knowledge is relative and becomes more integrated and evolved over time. Connectionist knowledge. Recognition is beginning of philosophy philosophy unified knowledge. The world is cyclical. Combo of opinions and agency create action. Nihilistic view of seeing the world as constant repetition and we must stand above and transcend that. Seek the highest truth.
- Positivity movement saw philosophy as the generalization of science. The idea of biology and Darwin really shaped philosophy at this time. Spencer never went to school or read a book to completion. He grew through being present and observation stranger to book learning with a matter of fact mindset that made his ideals distilled and clear. He was a practical worker who worked on the railroad. He was willing to try out anything like diets or inventions even if most failed very persistent and egotistical non conformer. All for coordination and synthesis. Spencer never made much money and was in poor health when he attempted to conquer most every problem in philosophy through his newsletter but it fell out of favor his rival John Stewart mill helped finance and encourage the continuation of his writing after some initial resistance and despite poor health he wrote for another 40 years believe in others and pursuit of truth.
- Genuis reminded the self to be fully objective geniuses aren’t fully adapted fully subjugate the will. Science is universal that contains particulars art is the particulars that contains a universal. Art helps us rise above the other wills. The ultimate will is nirvana to minimize will. Schopenhauer did not like women Jesus. He has a very pessimistic outlook and he never really got out and spent time with others wasn’t very happy and blamed the world for this problems. He instead of realizing his unhappiness just blamed the world and was a shut in. He also grew up in a tough geopolitical time but he needed to touch grass. He rejected the normal life and was very negative in his outlook which is just a negative ev bet. Maybe answer isn’t to destroy but harmonize the will however this negative outlook gives a great perspective positive philosophies gloss over even if it is very negative. He revealed the concept of desire which was a big step forward he also taught about genius art and beauty and the importance of cherishing those things. This was a time when Marx tried to destroy great men he kept them alive.
- Desires infinite fulfillment is limited Fulfillment never satisfies nothing is so fatal to an ideal as its realization satisfaction leads more to unhappiness than happiness because you need to alter your life so much, the fulfill the desire. Then the realized desire develops a new desire so on. Life is evil because pain is reality and pleasure is the temporary secession of pain. Evil and pain is essential to life. Suffering increases with intelligence most lies in anticipation as pain is brief. Human life is a tragedy. We’re unhappy married and we’re unhappy single always unhappy in all different aspects. Optimism is mockery of man’s woes. Nothing in life is worth striving and all good things are vanity. Happiness is only found in the ignorance of youth. The older we get the more we see death and we’re waiting to die. Fear of death is the birth of philosophy. This runs forever because we are continuously born. Success comes from subordinating the will to intelligence. Knowledge leads to control of our passions and purifies the will it is key to a happy life. Dangerous to read about a subject before we think for ourselves because then we’re outsourcing thinking. Happiness is in our head we face life alone happiness from ourselves is vital and world in which a man lives is shaped by how he looks at it. Since a man sees there is consciousness alone. It’s important to have a good conscience constitution of consciousness vital self sufficiency is vital and key to happiness. Contemplation of life. Unself intellect rises must see thing as objects of understanding we need to not view things connected to the will view things without subjectivity or personal interest views things objectively as ideas that leads to highest goods and peace. We set ourselves free from the will.

    - **Note:** This is some nihalistic shit. Desire is infinite and fulfillment only leads to more unhappiness as we run on the hedonic treadmill. Realized desire leads to new desires. we struggle to be happy in the moment and live in a state of anxiety and wanting not presence and happiness. Getting something we’ve wanted leads to unhappiness because we love the opioid of hope. We're unhappy in many aspects and happiness is found in ignorance. Success is subordinating happiness to intelligence the life of reason. We purify our passions and control our will. Don't outsource thinking. Happiness is internal and our perception shapes our reality. Contemplate life/ examined life. We need to view things objectively exercise free will and look for inner peace. Desire the examined life self sufficient presence and happiness. Philosophy starts when we know we will die so we have to make the most out of the time we have left.
      So many people struggle to be happy by desiring more but you can always want more likewise you can always be happy now in the moment.
- Schopenhauer grew up in a post revolutionary world where hope gave way to despair widespread destruction and people really thought the world was broken. His dad killed hkmsekf and his mom was an intellectual but hated him they fought and she pushed him down stairs they didn’t talk for the last 20 years of her life. He had no friends or family and threw himself into philosophy or war. Schopenhauer believed deeply in his work even though no one else did for 30 years and eventually his writing met the right time and audience for success. Schopenhauer made enemies not friends which led to his failure of getting published. To understand the external world we must understand ourselves. Humans only believe what they want try to appeal to his self interests logic is not possible to appeal to. Sees the entire world in actions and bodily dunftiknd as manifesting desire through will. All things have will even plants and the human will is a more conscious version of that essential plant will the great will is that will to reproduce. All things human or otherwise are guided by will. Philosophy is to see the similar patterns of humanity playing out throughout history in different circumstances. Individual is the phenomenon not the thing in itself. The more things change the more they stay the same history evolves as an unchanging mass of things. Human nature never changes all wise men and fools are alike throughout eras. Will is determined by the hole we don’t have free will we feel tether to a specific character. Desire is infinite fulfillment is limited.

    - **Note:** Schopenhauer grew up in a world everyone thought was broken. He had no family and friends and this led to his work not being discovered until later. No one supported him. He made enemies not friends. We need to understand ourselves before we understand the external world. You must appeal to self interest not logic. Humans believe what they want. We manifest desire through will and we all do this. Philosophy sees the unity in human nature. History is unchanging the world remains the same cyclical. Desire infinite fulfillment limited.
- The goal of his morals was to create objective good of what to do a categorical imperative place morals above everything even self interest always do shat is right treat humans as ends not means. Morality is how we become worthy of happiness. Were above the laws we make we are all free and a center of creativity. We ought to do the right thing. Believes in a god. Reduced religion to moral faith and hope. Religion is a common people devoted to common moral law. Religion has become fragmented and the tools of the powerful not as intended a moral guide this leads to curroption. Argues against people sending those to war who don’t have a say bad incentive allignment wants equality of opportunity. Kant invents critical nature. He tried to reconcile many different conflicting views. Set the tone for modern philosophy. Thought goes from unity to diversity to diversity in unity. Task of all fields is unification in hagels philosophy. Life made for achievement not happiness and suffering leads to greater accomplishment and is beneficial. Change is the rule and goal of life and those who bring it are manifesting an underlying movement. Life is struggle of two different sides fighting for change. Hagel followers split along his right and left of his dialectic. Things are product of their age some periods of happiness are met with larger strife of change.

    - **Note:** Kant and his categorical imperative. Morality is how we become worthy of happiness. Were above the laws and must do the right thing. Religion is faith morals and hope. Argues against bad incentives in government and religion creates critical nature. Life is achievement not happiness Frankle idea. Things are a product of the age. 2 sides fighting for change and unification of fields.
- At this time there was a rejection of mind and perception religion was being destroyed by reason. Save science from skepticism on learning being rejected for feelings and emotions. Experience never gives us general truths general truths must be apriori and separate from experience these truths come from our mind. Mind of man isn’t passive wax or abstract name but active organ that molds things and transforms chaos into thought. Transcendental philosophy studies this it’s not worried about objects but apriori concepts of knowledge turns experience into knowledge 2 stages projecting sensations on perceptions. Second stage turning perceptions into conception the categories of thought. Sensation going into knowledge take atoms of sensations molds into sense. Space and time are apriori organs of perception. Perceptions arranged sensations around space and time conceptions relates perceptions around causes and unity of the mind ie the mind digests and categorizes perception cosmic ordering of data by the mind. Sensation is unorganized stimulus perception is organized sensation conception is organized perception science is organized knowledge wisdom is organized life. Ordered thought creates order in the world. Laws or science and nature are the same truth is absolute and ever lasting. Science is perceptions and conceptions not things. Space time and cause are perceptions of understanding. He ended up destroying nieve science limiting it in scope into surface and appearance saving science then argued that religion couldn’t be understood through reason saving but killing religion.

    - **Note:** Religion destroyed by reason. General truths are apriori separate from experience that come from our mind. Man is an active being that transforms and molds the world. Transcendental philosophy turning concepts into knowledge through experience. Knowledge is projecting sensations on perception then perception into though. Replace empiricist with rational thought. Good explanations
      Sensation is unorganized stimulus perception is organized sensation conception is organized perception science is organized knowledge wisdom is organized life.
- Voltaire had a good gig but he gave it up because he had a change of morals when he saw how people were treated for religious beliefs he made it his mission to rebel against the mighty church. He became intolerant of religious intolerance and launched a campaign against it writing under real and fake names arguing for philosophy above all. Important to believe in god with eternal punishment or reward because that keeps you doing good things the only other way people could be good would be beneficence which is hard to count on. Human nature never changes. We never see change in the moment and freedom and equality are in constant contradiction. Voltaire advocated for reason while Russoue advocated for revolution and action. Voltaire I do t agree with what you say but I’ll defend to the death your right to say it he was in deep disagreement with russeou but protested his books being burned and offered him sheltering when he was on the run. We can’t have perfect world but that does mean if we destroy it we can make it better human nature never changes and revolution leads to the same backwards cycles and patterns so it’s just chaos mixed with new power structures but ultimately the same oppressor oppressed dynamic the only way we can live is incremental improvement not destructions. Men form institutions institutions for men unless you change human nature, you can’t change institutions.
- Voltare was a man not of nobility who was exiled many times and taught and thought for himself made his own money and produced world changing philosophy. He brought the enlightenment Brittish ideas to France that planted the seeds for the revolution. Voltaire sat on the court of Fredrick the great and while he was there the conversations they had were better than any book in existence important of good conversations between smart people. Voltaire eventually got kicked out of this court due to his own mallace and maybe secret desire to go home. He then left only to realize he was exhiled and in his darkest moment he wrote his greatest work. He wanted to write a history of the mind. He wrote an objective philosophy of history which offended everyone in its impartiality. Ethic of athesism all thru world is guided by egoism and self love virtue is egoism with a spyglass. Conscious is the fear of beliefs not voice of god morality founded on sociology not theology. Spread knowledge and encourage industry in the face of religious dogma. Voltaire argues for fallibility of knowledge and content with modest advances not just new systems
    - **Tags:** #independent-thinking, #god-(argument-for), #world-altering-moment, #gods, #dogma-(resist-it), #voltaire, #fallability-(of-knowledge), #good-explanations, #power-dynamics
    - **Note:** Voltaire was an independent thinker who brought enlightenment ideas to France and developed them through good conversation. He had power but fell out with those in charge and created his own philosophy that tried to kill god. Argued for fallability of dogma and against religious knowledge world altering moment when Christianity starts to regress.
- We are all connected to god. Blessedness is not the reward of virtue but virtue itself. Immortality is clear thought itself not result of. The ignorant man lives agitated and unconscious lives passively the wise man is scarcely moved in spirit never ceases to be always enjoys satisfaction of mind. Sees conflict as inherent in man and the value of states is protection enabling freedom you must give up some powers in order to have societal freedom but also advocates and believes society cannot exist without free speech. Argues against revolution except when free speech is restricted. Universal military service and right to bear arms. People prefer tyranny to chaos. When people begin to think it’s impossible to stop and it can kill the modern systems in any way.
- The mind is ideas themselves in their process and concatenation. There is no such thing as intellect or will but the mind operating as a complex system creates these things at a higher level of emergence. Every idea becomes an action unless it’s stopped. Idea is the beginning of a process which the action is the completion will is the desire of man which may not be clear but involves self preservation always. Everything wants to persist in its own being to show its essence. Things give us pleasure because we desire them and there is no free will. Studies humans as obeying fixed laws and views desire impartially as properties of human nature not vices. 3 system of ethics the one of Buddha and Jesus that seems to respond to hate with good men are equal the idea of virtues based in love praises democracy 2 nitzche and Machiavelli except inequality of men relishes conquest and rule ethic is in power praises aristocracy then of Socrates Plato and Aristotle that stresses I’m leaving mature and informed mind and rational decisions associated virtue with intelligence. Spinoza Associates ethic with maximizing happiness with relatives pleasure and pain. Pleasure is movement toward what makes you happy and is right and Pain is moving away from that. Moving toward completeness and power. Passion is good in that it preserves our power and being. Each man must love himself and seek what is useful to him builds his ethic not on fully just or fully selfish but on egoism man’s happiness is in maintaining man’s being. Doesn’t see use for humility and thinks it’s very rare but admires modesty. But also believes hatred is bad and advocates for love to drive out hate. Endeavor to understand is the core virtue in this he’s very Greek. Passion without reason is blind and reason without passion is dead. Passion is no longer a passion when we form a logic idea about it. Passions come from inadequate ideas and virtues from adequate idea. Intelligence is the core virtue. Thought is aided by imagination. By imagination and reason we turn experience into foresight become creators of our future not the slaves of our past we achieve human liberty through this from passion and impulse we’re only free where we know only desire what we desire for everyone freedom is rule over yourself. Determinism allows us to believe all things follow by the eternal will of god. Sees all things as part of a larger eternal order which is like god. Content with the world and universe. Love of fate doesn’t offend me. Say yes to life and death. Love the world even if it outcasts you.

    - **Note:** Mind takes thoughts and turns them into actions. Existence proceeds essence. Takes root feelings and transforms them into actions at higher levels of emergence. Ethics of responding to hate with love. Ethic of power and ethic of virtue. Passion is following what you love pain is misalignment. Love yourself and do what is of use to you. Imagination allows us to turn experience into prediction. Be content with the universe creatots of our future not slaves to our past. Free yourself. Free will and determinism
- Spinoza was a Jew ecocommunicated for his religious beliefs and ideas of god. Had many opportunities at wealth but turned them down if he had to compromise on his values. Didn’t ever have a lot of money always had enough could’ve been rich but turned it away. Argued religion was mainly allegory and god and nature were the same. Spinoza saw the ethics and morality of Jesus to be god like near perfect. He didn’t publish the ethics during his life because he didn’t want to cause trouble. The more the mind knows the better it can liberate itself. Only knowledge is freedom and its pursuit is true happiness speak in a manner clear to the people seek only what you need to maintain health and the money you need there is knowledge from hearsay from empirical ideas from deduction/ reasoning. Highest knowledge is combo of empirical and deduction. Spinoza saw fixed and mutable parts of the world. Temporal order world of things and eternal order world of laws and structures. All temporal things are also in fixed/ eternal things. Substance is what is everything else derives from that substance. The will of god is the laws of nature the world is deterministic not designed. This biggest issues in philosophy come from projecting our human agency and feelings into an indifferent world there is no evil is nature that’s a human construct nature just is and it’s wrong to give human agency to unbiased events.

    - **Note:** Highest knowledge is combo of empirical and deduction. Never compromised on his values and got him excommunicated never published during his life. Only knowledge is freedom and its pursuit is true happiness. Mind's liberation of itself. Biggest issues come from projecting human agency onto neutral events perception and interpretation the world just is and when we project negative things on this isness we struggle to live.
- Enlarging of human Empire to all things possible is Bacons utopia. Politicians have always been hated. Constant scientific exploration, and growth. Utopia across history has always been peaceful, living, guided by the government of the most enlightened and Noble. Everything is learnable to man and man, not fight man, but fight nature to learn more. 3 grades of ambition expand power in country expand power of nation over world and expand humans dominion over the universe. Bacon made too many enemies and that was his downfall you need to cultivate positive relationships always. He was thrown from court but focused on philosophy which made his life better.
    - **Tags:** #philosophy, #failure-(from-smart-people), #dominance, #utopia-(issues-with), #francis-bacon
    - **Note:** Bacon saw Utopia as rule of the rich guided to give everyone the best life. Expanding man dominance over the world. He pissed people off and was thrown from court, and then focused on philosophy, which brought him peace in life despite his failure.
- Bacon set the framework for new science creating the scientific way of modern thinking finding practical knowledge that is implemented nothing is beneath or above science. Understand people’s temperament and their goals. Argued to be like Machiavelli don’t let your feelings be too known even to friends don’t say too much or too little. Bacon saw philosophy as the highest science yiu needed the empirical work but tied together at a higher level of philosophical emergence. Saw increasing specialization of smart people and key synthesizers. Socialization of science for conquest of man. Had a benefactor in power who helped him. Thought is aid of observation not substitute. Bacon needs to progress science and wants to do this by moving on from the Aristotelian world view. Humans bias the world by seeing a human centric world not the universe create uneven mirrors our thoughts are reflections of us not analysis of other things. Humans would rather be violent and dogmatic than change their mind and admit they were wrong. We should be suspicious of what we like because we’re biased to believe it’s true so we should add more scrutiny. We are also biased by what happens and outcomes rather than the probable nature of events and respecting that. These are biases in all humans then there is specific human bias relative to their predisposition. Some people are biased toward antiquity some toward novelty. We just need to be aware and check our specific biases. then there is biases in the marketplace where we become dogmatic around concepts like the unmoved mover which we say makes sense and everyone believes, but it doesn’t make a ton of sense and we know that intuitively, but we have dissonance to the market or talking about infinites and these are laws. Idols of the theater the bias of past ideas on present ideas we can’t use old models from Plato but need to build new ones for new times. Troubles due to dogma and deduction. We need to test our starting point with conjecture not start from “truth” of the past because that is partially wrong. Need methodic doubt scientific method. We need to test and make guesses about nature. We must first know the underlying explanations of things to manifest forms in the real world of that knowledge

    - **Note:** We all have biases our models that need to check. Under radar beliefs from the bottom up. Believed in human nature, Machiavelli type ideals. Philosophy is based in empiricism, but is distill a higher level of emergence. Humans are biased by their perspective and by the probable ballistic world with definite outcomes. Great scientist are great synthesizers people would rather be violent then change their mind. Avoid dogma build on the past.
- Politics he believed in aristocracy a rule of the educated had very traditional male female beliefs men should marry at 37 to 20 year olds because that’s when there rearing years are and womens place is master of home. Says revolution usually bad and causes more harm than good usually we can defer to history. Argues for constitutional democracy mix of democracy and aristocracy as best ruling configuration. Aristotle ideas were revolutionary but ultimately they didn’t believe in flux and change and were not very inspiring. Aristotle was a great philosopher who set the ideas for philosophy for many centuries and generations. Stoicism and Epicurusfound seperate schools one talked about resolve in tough times the other ruthless pleasure seeking. The times were chaotic and the 2 ideas that came up were keep full internal locus of control of live for the moment and go crazy. Gratitude is nourished with expectation bacon grew up a lord dad died young asked his old supporters for help from a place of expectation which hurt him a bit but despite being set back a few years he became a respected man in government and logic. Bacon made many enemies was always living ahead of his means but always climbing in life. Bacon wanted to be a philosopher king but wanted to use studies pragmatically not just knowledge without action. Bacon argues it’s better to talk to someone for an hour than a days meditation. Distribute wealth to quell revolution. Divide enemies unite friends.
- Happiness is the end goal of life and living in your nature doing things that make you curious is how to achieve happiness the chief condition of happiness is the life of reason and intellectual stimulation in thought excellence and happiness depends on clear judgement self control Symmetry of desire and artistry of means. Achievement of experience in the fully developed man. He then conjectures the golden mean as the way to achieve balance and happiness in life. We are what we repeatedly do. Golden mean in habits that most be formed and done over time not actions. Excellence in habits makes a great life. In the golden mean there are super liberal or conservative people and there version of far left may be a mean. In addition to excellence in habits friendship and close relationships are key to happiness and happiness is a fully internal thing. Stresses constant balance.

    - **Note:** Happiness is an internal not an external thing created by the life of reason and intellectual stimulation following what gives you energy and is in your nature. This is Aristotle and his Golden mean idea. Symmetry of desite artistic means. Becoming the fully developed man and realizing your potential. Great habits make a great life. Balance is key in all thigs.
- Aristotle was one of the best thinkers of his age and taught Alexander the Great. He invented many of the great logical concepts we know today. Moved philosophy from metaphysics to logic. Logic is the art and method of correct thinking it’s a science. Logic relies on systematic rules that creates a scientific method believed in defining every term. Plato was a man of universals ie man vs a man Aristotle reverted to more specific examples less general. Big contribution was a sylagism which says if 2 things have the same conclusions they are equal A=C and B=C A=B. The old Aristotelian views builds on past science which had conjectured earth being center of universe and evolution despite crude methods Aristotle saw life getting more complex and intelligent over time. Evolution had been posited at this time and while Aristotle wasn’t an amazing biologist and lacked many tools for experiments he did get a fair amount right we consider modern biology in metaphysics saw god as the unmoved mover and believed things had essential and deep forms. Believes our character is shaped by habits and surrounding where we live people we work with but also some innate being too. Art appeals and represents to the internal nature of things appeals to intellect and feelings aims for form and unity. Aristotle taught Alexander the Great and was one of the first people to create state sponsored education one of the best thinkers of his age.
- Human psychology is based on desire emotion and knowledge until we have better humans we cannot hope to have better states because states are governed by human psychology men who continuously desire and want more are those who conquer. Embodiment of desire constantly wanting more material things and pushing goals further. Some people are temples of feelings and courage they care not what they fight for on the battlefield but in pride and bravery itself in winning on the battle then people who yearn for meditation and knowledge above all men of wisdom who pursue truth not power not interested in goods or victory just focused alone unused from the world. Plato argues for taking kids from their parents young teaching them sport and arts creating a fully formed human but not being overly dogmatic to one tilt also believes in god as a great uniting force very important in a society. Then the men are weeded out those who meet the highest marks become the philosopher kings while those not up to scratch become bankers and workers ect. Tested not just intellectually but also physically. They would use religion to justify the selection of people into different classes and held philosophers as highest and philosophy would only be taught to people who passed the highest tests. Meaning comes from classifying and generalizing things finding laws of being and their goals to classify them into different areas. Higher education is the search for ideas and connection of things at higher levels of emergence Ie higher level ideas. Coordinate our sense experience in terms of law and purpose and must find laws of operation and meaning in things. After teaching for philosophy are tested in the field for 15 years in the game of life and those that survive and thrive become the rulers. Plato decrees ruling class is an aristocracy but by education such that anyone can rise to that level and those in power have no possessions just a comfortable life but one that doesn’t get out of hand. Promotes selective breeding and eugenics to create the best kids believes women can rule and argues for kids being taken from their parents and raised by a community not a person so those in power have no attachment and can’t play favorites. Everyone has a place and justice is having and doing what is one’s own. People do what they do best and this leads to justice. Loving with their essential nature is justice.

    - **Note:** There are people who pursue power and philosophers who pursuit truth. Plato‘s Republic is this eugenic communist society where the philosopher king rule and everyone is taught from young age only the best get to be in charge so it’s a meritocracy. Human nature is a combination of knowledge and desire. Argues for virtue for its own sake and deeper level thinking understanding the first principles then abstract it to the second level.
- Plato. Philosophy unlike science makes bold conjectures into the unknown about things that can’t be measured. Philosophy is made of logic aesthetics ie forms ethics politics and metaphysics. Philosophy is about unknown unknowns things we can’t prove by science but that are still important. Ancient Greece was open to the world and hearing all these different perspective cultivated doubts. The more you see the more skeptical you get. This was a time of great exploration in knowledge and there was a true democracy as well as a budding oligarchy. Socrates didn’t claim wisdom only the humble pursuit of it. Philosophy starts when men begin to doubt. He asked about the true nature of honor ect. Wanted to help define and show true virtue and wisdom. Socrates preached rule of aristocrats and was killed when the democrats won in war. Argue that lesser men want equality but better men want freedom. Argues justice vs power. Plato’s utopia was a return to nature anarchist communism. States are made of 2 states the rich and poor states start as aristocracy then go to plutocratic oligarch. Democracy fails because of an uneducated populist where people outsource beliefs to art and others for what to think. Politics becomes a political class of power games. Eventually we elect the loudest and most handsome charismatic not the most fit to rule and the democracy collapses because we don’t elect who is fit to rule.

    - **Note:** Philosophy is about bold conjectures in uncertain areas to find a deep truth. The more ignorant you are of your ignorance the more you know. Greece cross disciplinary world provides this as well as free thinking provided by democracy. Philosophy is the humble pursuit of wisdom starting with doubt. Ask fundamental questions about the virtues. Freedom vs equality are enemies. Wanted the rule of the smart and wealthy on merit because true democracy is corrupted by the masses. Politics becomes power games and popularity instead of merit
