### Highlights

- The world is malleable. Explore and create his father was a nasa astronaut he had been to the deepest part of the ocean a deep understanding of the world makes you it’s master. Luck is the intersection between preparation and opportunity and you need to be willing to risk everything. Games are art where creativity and exploration meet. He made games and built worlds through multidisciplinary learning. Hero’s are people who took epic journeys into the unknown often at substantial personal risk like Shackleton who’s motto was by endurance we conquer. Garriott built games since he was in high school. D&D like company building. There is a world created with the creator as dungeon master interacting with the other players to solve problems and move the adventure forward. Good metaphor for building a company. Edwin lande we’re a country of transcontinental explorers leaving safety to explore the frontier. These are no longer the gold mines of the west but the the gold minds of the intellect and the explorers are the scientists with the frontier now being visible as invention.

    - **Note:** The world is a malleable place for those who try to effect it. You need to have a deep understanding of the world before you can transcend it. But life is a game more than anything and we’re all players.
      Luck is the intersection between ability and opportunities Louis pasteru and you have to be willing to take extreme personal risk.
      Garriott had a deep commitment to the craft and had been working in gaming since high school D&D.
      There is always a new frontier for the renegades who saddle up. Agency and meaning in your life.
- Company’s built around attention. These scientific adventurers make you think after an invention that who would’ve even thought their domain of invention existed because the invention is so revolutionary this relates to garriott because he turns d and d into creating a computer game which was something novel and something that had never been done before. He believed story telling was vital but could be learned. The story defines the product this is no more true than in gaming. Story telling is an innate human instinct and people like jobbs were master story tellers and refined their stories testing and improving them constantly. The early stages of computer games were text based and created for fun not money. They were transported by people giving the floppy disks to one another. He wrote games in basic as his foreign language requirement and made games by trial and error but mostly error. He finally went to this place called computer land where he made a game so good the people there thought he should sell it he made it on the Apple 2. He spent his entire life savings $200 to make the games and sold 12 the first week his mom made the cover art. At this point there was few people in the world making computer games and no one thought it could be an industry it is now the largest entertainment medium in the world. He made 150k off his first game in the 70s more than 2x his dads yearly salary as an astronaut. As the new technologies emerge people can make new innovative games. Ultima became his gaming series that he made for 25 years and the 2x expansion in ram allowed him to make the game more expansive. Hold on so future technology can uplift you.

    - **Note:** He rode the wave of technology and what looked like a toy became a massive industry. He followed his curiosity and took a shot on himself made a lot of money. The industry was so new people just passed games to others in floppy disks.
      Genius hits targets others can’t see. The invention was so revolutionary that no one could conceptualize it.
- He decided to self publish starting a company called origin systems out of his parents house with his brother. The first programmer showed up randomly and discheveled with long hair and a beard and ended up staying with the company for 15 years having seen the add in the paper. They bet the company on Apple but IBM PCs became dominant this lead them to lose money and they took out a 1mm loan co-signed by the brother owners. They should’ve shut the company down but they bet it all. Excellence is the capacity to take pain. They were so close to failure and the situation was so dire garriott got financial updates in the fetal position his mistake was ruin the company and it ate at him. Crafted many languages for games. Since language and writing is the bed rock for society the stories grow out of languages. The belief system of the founder is embeddd in the company. Imitation follows creation. Garriott got original he had made millions just copying what others did. He wanted to be original but his brother the business side said it would kill the game and not be successfu instead it was extremely successful and Ultima and later Ultima online was credited as creating mmorpgs a massive paradigm in the gaming market. He didn’t think this was original because this idea was rooted in the history of the industry. Still many didn’t study the history so thought it was original that’s why you study history he wanted to make this game for a decade and but had to wait until the market was ready.

    - **Note:** This is historical creativity where you discover a novel thing by just studying the past. His interesting language and society led him to inventing mmorpgs which was a paradigm shift in video games. He was scared to be original but his originality changed the world.
      He bet the company and risked everything betting on the wrong technology hearing market updates in the fetal position and taking on a personal 1mm loan to save the company risking everything excellence is the capacity to take pain. Personal failure and risking everything
- He sold to ea and the big company wasn’t allowing him to build the games he wanted. They wouldn’t give him a budget because he was creating a new paradigm and the marketing people projected off of comps so revenue was projected at 0. He begged for 2 years and eventually got a budget 20x smaller than average. He created a strategy where people would pay $5 just to beta test the game because they didn’t have enough marketing or production money. Ea thought they would sell 30k copies ever but they sold 50k week 1. Ea then put all their focus on the game but also put managers on the game. Which hurt creativity. They built the game ti handle thousands of people at once but didn’t expect millions they were unprepared to work on a game that never finished they were unprepared for success and he couldn’t anticipate how people would interact with the product. He created a virtual economy that bled through to the real world with people making wages off it and criminals using it illegally saw people were willing to send real money on virtual things buying things on eBay a real estate market popped up and people exchanged real dollars for what could take weeks of game time. When he moved to ea he thought it was good for the company to grow but the team only fractured with b team players taking the lead. Ea also forced him to cut games fire people and release games before they were finished. In this they started to lose the entrepreneurial spirit they had cultivated as an i digital company. Ea sends in new managers every year who try to change the culture but just get replaced by other ea managers and the teams could never gel and produce good products eventually garriott is fired and ends up crying in a grocery parking lot

    - **Note:** This is a great example of the importance to retaining control the dogmatism of large organization a drift to low performance and how innovation doesn't happen on a spreadsheet but is emergent from blind walks through a forest. He created ultima online inventing mmorpgs and the spreadsheet guys didn't get that eventually he was forced out of his own company
