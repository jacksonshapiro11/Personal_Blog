- In his mid 20s he’s toiling and looking for what he wants to do drifting in between jobs when he reads a book with the thesis that average products can be produced cheaper over seasons and rich countries will need to produce differentiated products to survive. One book changed his life. Pleasent workplace that fostered interaction and creativity and didn’t push people too hard giving them long and relaxing breaks. Make a profit in an ethical way.
