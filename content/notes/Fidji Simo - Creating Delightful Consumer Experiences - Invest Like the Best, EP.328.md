### Highlights

- Lessons on Building Consumer Products from the Playbook at Facebook
  Key takeaways:
  - Building great consumer products involves understanding what consumers want and latent demand.
  - At Facebook, the playbook was to observe what users were doing with a product not built for that use case as a sign of something to productize.
  - Facebook Marketplace and other features were created based on existing user behaviors on the platform.
  - To build great consumer products, it's important to observe what users are already trying to do and build upon that.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  You mentioned that at Facebook, you learned what it meant to build great consumer products. What does that mean specifically? What's the dimensionality of those lessons?
  Speaker 1
  I think it was a lot about understanding exactly what consumers wanted and also understanding latent demand. What I mean by that is the playbook at Facebook was really understanding what users were already doing with a product that wasn't necessarily built for that use case, as a sign that there was something there that you could productize and do something bigger with. That has been the case at Facebook over and over again. If you look at Facebook Marketplace, people were already using the core Facebook product to try to exchange goods. We built Facebook Marketplace as a result of that insight. People were already posting links to YouTube to share videos. Actually, it might be better to create a real video experience. But there was always a seed of something that we would build upon. I've taken that to a hard time, I didn't start to understand what are the things that people are already trying to do. I didn't start to translate into their trying to figure out what their meals for the weeks are. They're trying to actually come up with new recipes to diversify their diet. Every time we see something like that, we just build a product experience around it to help users with the things that they're fundamentally already trying to do. ([Time 0:06:22](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b9845eaf-a5bc-44ee-ac98-ca74052bb716))
    - **Note:** Build a product experience around what people are trying to do but isn’t 100% native to the app like building Facebook marketplace.
- Reimagining Online Commerce for Groceries
  Key takeaways:
  - The current online commerce experience is not very natural for people in terms of thinking about their needs and constraints.
  - A more natural way to approach meal planning and grocery shopping would be to input constraints and preferences into an engine that recommends meals and adds ingredients to a cart with one tap.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Because if you think about commerce fundamentally, it is a pretty weird experience online because you already need to know exactly which products you want, go into a search box, type that product, select the product, add it to a cart. It is not how people think about their life. They've gotten used to it because that's all we could do with the tools that we had. But fundamentally when people think about feeding their families, they think, okay, I have a budget of $200 for 10 meals. I have a family of five, one of them has food allergies. We all like Mexican food. What can I make this week with all of these constraints? That's the way you think about managing your family. And then ideally, you would have an engine that tells you, okay, with all of these things, this is what we would recommend for breakfast and lunch and dinner. And in one tap, you can add all of these ingredients to your cart. That is a much more natural way of thinking about the problem of what's for dinner, what are we going to put on the table than the current such experience. So we are really rushing towards this ideal use case of helping you with all of the questions that you have to run your family and helping you and saw them in a much easier way, thanks to Generatee AI. ([Time 0:10:04](https://share.snipd.com/snip/82ab6ac5-102d-418b-8044-38a82b94a2f6))
    - **Note:** Use generative ai and nlp to creat a better UX when searching online.
- Shifting towards AI-native Products
  Key takeaways:
  - Generatee AI offers a more natural and comprehensive experience for helping families with meal planning and groceries.
  - To fully embrace AI, companies need to think about how they would rebuild their products from scratch with current AI tools.
  - This includes considering conversational experiences instead of just a search box.

  Speaker 1
  And in one tap, you can add all of these ingredients to your cart. That is a much more natural way of thinking about the problem of what's for dinner, what are we going to put on the table than the current such experience. So we are really rushing towards this ideal use case of helping you with all of the questions that you have to run your family and helping you and saw them in a much easier way, thanks to Generatee AI. In order to really embrace the shift, you need to think about what it would look like to go AI-native. And what I mean by that is having AI not bolted on the side to your current experience. But if thinking about if you were solving the problems that your company is trying to solve, now from scratch, with the tools that are currently available, how would you rebuild your products? Would you rebuild the same or would you rebuild it in a completely different way? Would you have poor conversational experience instead of having a search box? And that is really important because that echoes in earlier stage of my career where I was asked to figure out how to monetize mobile at Facebook during the shift to mobile. And there was a clear contrast between the companies that were embracing the shift to mobile by taking their web experience and desperately trying to shrink them on a small screen versus the ([Time 0:11:01](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f8e913d0-4a37-4420-b4fc-a0e15aebc04e))
    - **Note:** Embrace AI and become AI native vs just having it as a sidecar
- The Importance of Rich Data for AI Grocery Experiences
  Key takeaways:
  - Building a catalog of millions of items that includes availability, nutritional value, and ingredients takes years of work and becomes the foundation for any AI experience in groceries.
  - Rich data is critical for creating AI experiences on top of large language models.
  - Companies should focus on identifying the data sets that will create the most value for their experiences.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  This is a point that I made about data earlier is a good example where creating these experiences on top of large language models is going to become again fairly easy and then on top of that you're going to have a lot of tools to help the software development process itself. But if you don't have incredibly rich data to start with, that becomes a lot harder. And so for us, building a catalog of millions of items where you know the availability all across the US, where you know the nutritional value and all of the ingredients that go into every product, that is a very hard thing that take years to build, take a lot of work and becomes the foundation for any other experience because fundamentally any AI experience that we can think of in the context of groceries is going to result at some point into translating whatever recipes or meal plan is into a set of ingredients, understanding the catalog of these different merchants is absolutely critical. I encourage companies to really think about what is the thing that's the data sets that's going to create most value or the experience in the translating the digital into physical experience in the world that's going to be really hard. ([Time 0:14:12](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0bb5b8bc-2802-4994-ba7a-cfd44a1123cc))
    - **Note:** What data or physical to digital is hard then use that to leverage llms
- The Importance of Customer Goals and Pragmatism in Technology
  Key takeaways:
  - Software should serve a customer's end goal
  - Pragmatic technologists focus on solving real human problems with technology
  - Technology can be used to connect people and build communities
  - Software should be thought of as a tool to solve problems rather than just a product
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  I think in this era of software being such a great business model and the margins being so high and all these things, we've lost sight of the fact that we create software for a reason to serve a customer's end goal. And I've heard you describe yourself as a pragmatic technologist before and I like that term, but I'm also curious what that means to you and how that term applies in this shifting world.
  Speaker 1
  I grew up in a family of fishermen. I was always very down to earth, very much thinking of technology in the context of literally at the time putting food on the table. So even when I joined the tech industry, I always thought about technology being used to solve real human problems. I joined eBay early in my career and I never thought of eBay as this technology, I thought of it as this network where people would be connecting around their various commerce interests and communities. Then Facebook was the same thing, incredible technological sheet, but fundamentally what I cared about was, oh, I could stay in touch with my family in France very easily. I always go back to what is a fundamental problem that we're trying to solve. And in the case of Instacart, this question of what's for dinner is a question that every family asks themselves every week, pretty much since the dawn of time. ([Time 0:15:39](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e3cad50f-6061-4642-afd8-769c6f3940a2))
    - **Note:** Technology is meant to solve problems and aid our life. We need to understand what is the key job to be done for a technology
- The Importance of Scale for Unit Economics in the Instacart Business Model
  Key takeaways:
  - Scale is crucial in Instacart's business and achieving good unit economics
  - They lost money on every order until they reached 100 million orders
  - It took significant investment and density to reach that point
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  When we talked last, we talked a lot about this notion of scale. And I'm interested in the idea of scale around the core original business first, which is the shopping or picking business. And what you've learned about that, I had a funny experience with John Colison from Stripe, where he said early on, they felt they're going to disrupt everything and old, old farts were telling him, well, payments is a scale business. And he said, ah, turns out, payments really is a scale business. And it seems to me, this is a similar story where the March for Instacart, as I understand it, towards good unit economics is a story of achieving scale. I want to understand that in as much detail as you can explain it. How does this thing march towards great unit economics? What role does scale play in that?
  Speaker 1
  Scale is absolutely everything in this business. We used to lose money on every single order until we got to 100 million orders. That's a lot of orders. It took a lot of investment to get to the point where we had delivered enough orders and we had enough density that we could turn a profit. ([Time 0:29:23](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0d3d60d0-3c00-40ff-a593-dd9793a4dbae))
    - **Note:** Importance of scale. They lost money on every order until they got to 100mm orders.
- Building a Successful Food Brand on Instacart
  Key takeaways:
  - Designing for Instacart isn't the key to success, but rather designing for the online consumer.
  - There are brands like Staudé Foods that have thought about how to build emerging food brands with the new tools online provides.
  - CPG products can be built in a similar way to how software products are built, through A/B testing and experimentation.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  You mentioned AI native before and businesses needing to build AI native. What would it mean for a new food brand to build Instacart native? If you could give advice to a new brand that said, okay, part of what I want to do is make sure we build this company in such a way that will be really successful on Instacart. Does that mean anything? Is that predictable? Are there features that you notice of brands that do better or worse on Instacart?
  Speaker 1
  It's all about tapping into a category of products that consumers have demand for. I think it's a little bit of stream of just designing for Instacart. It's more designing for the online consumer, which we are a proxy for. And there's this company full disclaimer I'm an investor, but it's called Staudé Foods. And I love that company because basically what they've done is really thought about how do you build emerging food brands with all of the new tools that online allows you to do? And what would you take to build a CPG product like we build software products? And what that means is that the A-B tests the name of the products, the A-B test all of the colors of the packaging. Instead of having focus group of five people, they put that through Instacart ads instead. And through Instacart ads, they try to figure out, oh, okay, when the product is this way, actually people react better. When it's that way, people react worse. ([Time 0:41:21](https://share.snipd.com/snip/af8786f1-911e-478d-91c2-e048c250fa83))
    - **Note:** Build a brand native to the latest wave of technology. Why can’t you have a doctor recommend a diet and have Instacart deliver it.
- Instacart and Management Philosophy
  Key takeaways:
  - The speaker worked to understand the fears and hopes of growth partners to align incentives and create success together.
  - The tension between the speaker's company and Instacart has decreased as they now work towards mutual success.
  - The speaker values seeing the magic in people as a part of their management philosophy, and sees it as valuable to understand employees' strengths and find ways to utilize them effectively.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  There might also be this perception that I think he's outdated of growth is not fully embracing the relationship with Instacart and I think when I arrived in the job, I spent a lot of time with our growth partners to really try to understand what were their fears, what were their hopes, how do we realize incentives. And I think we're now at a place where it's very clear that our success doesn't come at their expense. In fact, the incentives are aligned and by driving this customer online, we are actually driving their business for the future and making sure that their customers remain loyal and increase the share of wallet with that grocer. And so that I think has really changed in the last couple of years while that tension used to exist and doesn't exist that much anymore.
  Speaker 2
  You've said to me before that part of your management philosophy, maybe a driving part, is to see the magic in people. It sounds very nice and I would love to understand what that means in practice. What does it mean to see the magic in people? Why is that valuable? What do you do about it? I would love to understand this method of yours.
  Speaker 1
  The thing I mean by that is that I always try to focus whenever I have a new team member on trying to understand what is the thing that that person really spikes on. The thing that makes them really unique and map problems we have to solve or opportunities we have to tackle to that person's unique strengths. ([Time 0:52:55](https://share.snipd.com/snip/86e1c260-7166-4f2b-805a-470888875ef4))
    - **Note:** Map problems to peoples unique strengths understand them then map problems to them
- How to Keep Learning While Managing a Complex Business
  Key takeaways:
  - The speaker manages a complex business with an unlimited buffet of problems to solve
  - The speaker learns a lot from their team and is not ashamed of asking questions
  - Coming from a different position, the speaker had to ramp up quickly on unfamiliar concepts
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  How do you keep learning? In a position like this, I'm always amazed by just the sheer amount of stuff to do. There's just an unlimited buffet of problems and things that you could do that are great, fires you could put out. How do you continue to learn as you also manage a business like this with so much complexity?
  Speaker 1
  I learned first a lot from my team. And my team will tell you I am never ashamed of stopping a meeting and hey, sorry, dumb question. I do not understand this. I want to learn. And that has helped me a ton because coming from Facebook, it was interesting. I was running a team of 6,000 people, so larger than Instacart. So Facebook app by many dimensions could be sort of as bigger jobs than running Instacart. But when I came into a CEO job, there were a lot of things that I had to ramp up on really quickly. We just talked about capital location. That's why Red Screen Books on it because like when you're a product leader at Facebook, that's not what you spend all of your time thinking about. I had to ramp up on HR matters and things like that. I think having the humility to say, hey, I don't know this. I want to learn. Spend an hour with me, explain it to me, talk to bottom. That has helped me a lot in ramping up in a lot of areas. And whenever I talk to someone new, I try to spend a lot less time talking about what I'm doing and really instead listening about, oh, okay, tell me more about your world. And I think that helps when you have that attitude. And the other thing is that I try to connect the dots between all of my different passions. So to give you a concrete example, as a passion project on my weekends, I have partnered with two co-founders to create a medical and research center around chronic, complex, chronic conditions. And I had to learn a lot about healthcare in that context. And this is knowledge that I was able to bring to Instacart when we were trying to figure out, okay, how do we crack getting into partnership with Medicare and Medicaid programs so that Instacart would be one of the reimbursable benefits as part of that. All of that healthcare knowledge came into play. And that's what I love about is all of the parts of my life end up adding to each other. And I constantly take what I learn in one area and apply to another. I'm on the board Shopify, for example, and again, great example of learning from one of the best commerce companies. And applying a lot of that knowledge to Instacart and vice versa, taking all of my lessons at Instacart and hopefully bringing that Shopify as well. So a lot of cross pollinating of the different passions in my life. ([Time 0:56:09](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e6fb9436-e818-4871-a67e-217615f2ce51))
    - **Note:** Humility when getting up to speed spend a lot of time listening and digesting their understanding and world view. Learning from different areas of life and synthesizing with current job. Being on the board at Shopify or working at a hospital cross disciplinary learning.
- Challenges in the Healthcare System and the Need for a Holistic Approach
  Key takeaways:
  - The healthcare system is not optimized to serve patients
  - Misalignment of incentives and oversimplification of the human body are reasons for the system's inefficiency
  - 80% of healthcare costs come from complex chronic conditions that affect multiple body systems
  - The healthcare system is still organized by specialties that look at patients as one organ
  - Many complex chronic conditions require expertise from various medical fields
  - Patients are often bounced around from specialist to specialist without anyone looking at the full picture
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  What was the most surprising thing that you've learned in your education on healthcare as part of that process?
  Speaker 1
  I think you need another one hour podcast.
  Speaker 2
  Give us a teaser.
  Speaker 1
  I think it's that fundamentally we have a healthcare system that for many reasons hasn't been optimized to really serve patients. And I think a lot of it has to do with sometimes misalignment of incentive, sometimes oversimplification of the complexity of the human body. And so to give you an example, it's about 80% of healthcare costs come from complex chronic conditions that affect multiple body system. And yet the healthcare system is still organized by specialties that look at you as if you were just one organ. You go to cardiologists, they look at your heart, you go to neurologists and they focus on your brain. But a lot of complex chronic conditions are actually at the intersection of immunology, cardiology, rheumatology. And that's why patients are bouncing around from specialists to specialists with no one looking at the full picture. And that's one of the things that we are trying to solve with my medical and research center. But it's a I would say a micro example of the bigger problem in healthcare, which is so many different silos and myopic views that don't serve the whole patient very well. ([Time 0:58:57](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c1cde62d-fea6-4cd9-b159-5a059608ba74))
    - **Note:** Issue you with healthcare is it takes a simplistic and fragmented view of a complex system that is the body.
- Persisting Through Obstacles in Leadership
  Key takeaways:
  - Obstacles are common in pursuing goals, but it's important to persist and find solutions.
  - Facebook Watch was initially unsuccessful, but pivots helped make it a successful product.
  - Leadership plays a significant role in problem-solving and managing stress.
  - Putting pressure on the team is not an effective solution to problems.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And sometimes it's pretty hard to find. But I know it's there and I'm gonna find it. I'm incredibly stubborn that way, which is a less generous view. But I think there's always some obstacles. I remember at Facebook, I had made a very big pitch for creating a video destination inside Facebook called Facebook Watch. And for about a year, it really wasn't working at all. No one was going there. And it took many pivots to be able to get it to a place where it's actually now an incredibly successful product that's responsible for a large chunk of Facebook Sam spent. But at the time, I remember I called that time my work through the desert because I was really looking for solutions and not finding many. But I'll tell you this thing that made me shell helpless at the time wasn't that the problem was hard. It was more that I thought my own leadership wasn't up to what I wanted it to be to solve the problem. The stress was getting to me. I was trying to solve the problem by just pressuring the team's holder. And that's never the right solution when you want to solve a hard problem. And one of my team members took me aside. It was a 10 second conversation. Hey, I've seen you at your best. This is not your best. And we're gonna need your best to solve this problem. Bye. We'll slap in the face. She is one of my most trusted team members. Yes, I need to bring my a game. And that means no fear, no stress, none of that. And we ended up obviously solving the problem. But I think fundamentally, you go to helplessness. ([Time 1:00:45](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7ad9868d-afdd-41ef-a53b-c165e711c2aa))
    - **Note:** Never is helpless always feels capible but you need teammates who set you straight and help you when you’re drifting off path.
