- Summary: Tyler Cowen's three laws, known as Cowen’s Laws, provide insight into critical thinking and humility. The first law emphasizes that everything has flaws, requiring a deep understanding to identify them. The second law highlights the vast amount of literature available on any given topic. Lastly, the third law asserts that all statements concerning real interest rates are flawed. These laws caution against overconfidence in one's judgment, a valuable lesson in various fields of study and discourse.

### Highlights

- Many of you have been asking for a canonical statement of what I sometimes refer to as Cowen’s Laws. Here goes:
  1. **Cowen’s First Law**: There is something wrong with everything (by which I mean there are few decisive or knockdown articles or arguments, and furthermore until you have found the major flaws in an argument, you do not understand it).
  2. **Cowen’s Second Law**: There is a literature on everything.
  3. **Cowen’s Third Law**: All propositions about real interest rates are wrong.
  I coined those some time ago, when teaching macroeconomics, yet I remain amazed how often I see blog posts which violate all three laws within the span of a few paragraphs.
  There is of course a common thread to all three laws, namely you should not have too much confidence in your own judgment. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrmy1vkjahsr2qnkcnv1bx7z))
    - **Note:** I would conjecture this only applied to known things and the value is finding areas where these don't apply that is how you generate alpha
