  Speaker 1
  He built the house that Ed lived in from the ground up with his own hands. And his dad taught his kids without ever saying so explicitly that they were expected to study hard and to go to college. And Ed was a great student. He was a great student in high school. He was a great student in college. He winds up graduating from the University of Utah. He gets two degrees, one in physics and the other one in the emerging field of computer science. This is in 1969. And so his original intention because he thought he's like, okay, well I'll never be able to, I'm not talented enough to be a Disney animator. So he's like, I have to choose a different goal. His original goal was like, okay, well what if I can learn how to design computer languages? And if you listen to the Paul Graham episode I did a few weeks ago, I think it's episode 314 on how to do great work. Paul has read a bunch of biographies and he noticed something. I want to read from that say very quick because we're about to see an example of this being true in Ed's own life. And so Paul writes, when you read biographies of people who've done great work, it's remarkable how much luck is involved. They discover what to work on as a result of a chance meeting, which is about to happen right now, are by reading a book they happen to pick up. So you need to make yourself a big target for luck. And the way to do that is to be curious, try lots of things, meet lots of people, read lots of books and ask a lot of questions. So he's like, okay, well, I'm going to design computer languages. Then I met a man who would encourage me to change course. Ivan Sutherland. Sutherland and his partner Dave Evans were actually running the university's computer science department. This is at U of U, which is the university at Utah. The way they ran this department is the way that a decade or two into the future Ed Catmull is going to run Pixar. And so this is what he saw. Sutherland and Evans were magnets for bright students. They led us with a light touch. They gave us workspace and access to computers and then let us pursue whatever turned us on. The result was a collaborative, supportive community, so inspiring that I would later seek to replicate it at Pixar. Now this is wild. I love. So essentially what's happening right now, what I'm about to describe to you is like, Ed's got a front row seat for the birth of, you know, the internet software technology industry. ([Time 0:09:47](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5430861d-5e33-4954-85bf-ea230198297b))
    - **Note:** Make yourself a big target for luck and take advantage of opportunities. Ed was motivated by Disney and Einstein together and when he made toy story and achieved all he wanted he felt empty. Ed is at Utah with Dave Evan’s and Ivan Sutherland who would lead arpa. He’s on the ground floor of the internet Utah was one of the 4 initial nodes on the arpa net and the professors mainly served to provide security to the students so they could do what they want and take chances which ended up being the model Ed used for Pixar. They got the best students led with a light touch gave the resources needed for success and created a strong community. Ed wanted to be an animator but couldn’t draw. This new invention called computers allowed him to pursue animation. George Lucas is an independent thinker when technology wasn’t being used Ik the industry Lucas saw the benefit of using them. Lucas lived in between Silicon Valley and LA. he created his own world that mixed the both without going to strong on either. George believed in his ability to shape the future and did it. He hired Ed to build out this graphics division of Lucas film which Steve Jobs later buys in George’s divorce. Importance of a purpose driven life when Ed reached his goal he felt empty because he set out to do all he wanted but now that he had reached success he didn’t know what was next had no purpose and felt empty. George Lucas invested in what he believed in most himself. Instead of getting a salary bump he demanded equity in Lucas film.

  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I remember one of Steve's attorneys telling us that if we were acquired by his client, we had better get ready to get on the Steve Jobs rollercoaster. The acquisition process was complicated by the fact that the negotiator for Lucas Film wasn't good. The chief financial officer underestimated Steve, assuming he was just another rich kid in over his head. This guy told me that the way to establish his authority in the room was to arrive last. His thinking was, which he articulated out loud to me, was that this would establish him as quote, the most powerful player in the room, since he and only he could afford to keep everyone else waiting. All it ended up establishing, however, was that he had never met anyone like Steve Jobs. The morning of the big negotiating session, all of us, but the CFO were on time. Steve and his attorney, me and my team, I don't have to list all the people, Lucas Film's attorneys and an investment baker. At precisely 10 a.m., Steve looked around and finding the CFO missing started the meeting without him. Steve had not only foiled the CFO's attempt to place himself atop the pecking order, but he grabbed control of the entire meeting. This would be the kind of strategic, aggressive play that would define Steve's stewardship of Pixar for years to come. Once we joined forces, he became our protector, as fierce on our behalf as he was on his own. Steve paid $5 million to spin Pixar off of Lucas Film and agreed to invest another $5 million to fund the company, which is hilarious. I think he's going to wind up, I think he told all in before they wind up making a profit. He puts 54 million of his own money into this company, and I think at the time, I've heard different estimates, but he had somewhere between like 70 and I think 70 and 90 million, so a gigantic chunk. And this is when he has next, so he's not like next successful at all. So unbelievable. Like, now he was one of maybe the greatest entrepreneur of all time, might be one of the greatest investors who else would do that. It's insane, but he's just investing a huge chunk of his net worth into this company, which he didn't know at the beginning. Again, after we signed our names, Steve pulled me and Alvia Side, put his arms around us and said, whatever happens, we have to be loyal to each other. The feisty little company called Pixar had been born. Now, what's fascinating about this part of the book is you just see how different things can be and how they change and evolve over time. This is who Steve's partnering with, right? This is who Steve's going to put almost all of his net worth into. And so he says, there's nothing quite like ignorance combined with the driving need to succeed to force rapid learning. The main business that we chose was to sell the Pixar image computer, which is going to fail. I think they sell like 100 of them or something like that. The problem was what we had never manufactured or marketed a high end machine before. We had no salespeople. We had no marketing people. I had never been responsible for a profit and loss statement. I knew nothing about how to manage inventory. And so this entire time, Ed is telling the story of just having to learn on the fly. And he's observing how all these other leaders, leaders, bosses, he's had in the past from George Lucas, realizing, hey, I can't really interact with the way that Steve interacts with people. And so he comes across the work of W. Edward Demings, who is an American working in Japan, actually helping the Japanese manufacturing industry, companies like Toyota and Sony are going to use Demings ideas. And so Ed realizes, hey, I can actually use Demings ideas. I treat them as metaphors. I could use them in my work. And so he identifies what he feels are the most important ideas and ones that he could use. The essence was this, the responsibility for finding and fixing problems should be assigned to every employee. If anyone at any level spotted a problem, Deming believed they should be encouraged and expected to stop the assembly line. Demings approach gave ownership of the responsibility for a product, product's quality to the people who were most involved in its creation. My approach to managing picks are going forward was to be guided by the central tenant. You don't have to ask permission to take responsibility. And so for many years, they don't even know what their business is going to be. They go through a bunch of different products and business models. And so he's talking about this time. My memory of that period is that it is one of constant searching for a business model that would put us in the black. ([Time 0:26:05](https://share.snipd.com/snip/435ca331-1a9e-4b69-907a-b6f9f617f3c7))
    - **Note:** They didn’t know what their business model was going to be they were wandering through a forest lost trying ti get to product market fit. When Steve bought the company he was very strong opinionated and forceful but his clear life goal was that he was going to build great products as his mission. Ed in the early years created a culture of ownership and agency in Pixar. Anyone could speak up and was expected to take charge when things were going south. They were struggling then made the bet the company bet to go all in on their core competency animation. They previously had tried to sell hardware but they were really struggling and needed to go big. Steve let the talent do what it wanted but when it came to the business side he was in charge. Pixar was the best collection of only a players Steve had ever seen doing computer animation movies something never been done before breaking ground is hard. They sign a contract with the animation experts in Disney and their first product is toy story. Steve realizes it’s a hit and knows Disney will make a longer partnership offer and Pixar needs to raise cash to negotiate better terms in the offer so they ipo 1 week after Toy story is released the movie is incredibly successful it’s the biggest ipo of the year. Disney comes back 6 months later to partner and this new cash allowed them to go from a 90-10 to 50-50 splits. Natural competition easy partnership Steve saw in the future.
- The importance of team and talent in storytelling
  Key takeaways:
  - Toy Story's success led to Steve Jobs renegotiating a deal with Disney for better terms
  - Going public after Toy Story's release raised $140 million for the company
  - Getting the team right is crucial for success
  - Supporting good people leads to the development of good ideas
  - Balancing talent and work-life balance can be a challenge

  Speaker 1
  Like you're going to have to realize that. And so he meets with Steve meets with John and John Leseter. And yet Katmo is like, okay, Toy Story is almost ready. We're going to go public. And they're like, what? And so like, hell no, we can't do this. And it says Steve disagreed. This is our moment. He said, and then he lays out his logic. Let's assume that Toy Story is a success, he said. And let's actually assume it's a big success, he said. When that happens, Disney CEO Michael Eisner, who's at the time, will realize that he has created his own worst nightmare, a viable competitor to Disney. This is all Steve's logic. Okay. Steve predicted that as soon as Toy Story came out, Eisner would try to renegotiate our deal and keep us close as a partner. In this scenario, Steve said he wanted to be able to negotiate better terms. Specifically, he wanted a 50 50 split with Disney on the financial returns. I think at this time, it was like, 90 10 or 85 10, something like that. So if Disney's getting the, I mean, they're putting up the money, they're distributing, they're getting the investment during the money. Seems like we can't run a business that way. We got a, we got a, we need 50% of the profit. And to do that, we need to be able to put up 50% of the money for the movies. In order to fulfill these terms, we would have to be able to put up our cash for our put up cash for our half of the production budgets, a significant amount of money. And to do that, we would have to go public, he said. And this is the crazy thing. It's like Babe Ruth calling a shot, right? We would, he says, we're going to go public one week after Toy Story opened because he believed he's, he watched Toy Story. In fact, when I was reading, I read a bunch of biographies on Larry Ellison years ago and Larry Ellison was best friends with Steve Jobs. And he said that Steve was obsessed with Toy Story, that he'd make Larry Ellison watch it like 30 times. It was crazy. So he's like, Oh, this is, this is a hit. Like, this is going to be a smash. Toy Story drops on, I think that Thursday, we're going to go public the third, the Thursday after that, if I'm remembering this correctly. So he says we would go public one week after Toy Story. Steve turned out to be right. As our first movie broke records at the box office, all of our dreams seem to be coming true. And then our initial public offering raised nearly 140 million for the company, the biggest IPO of 1995. And a few months later, as if on cue, Eisner calls, saying that he wants to renegotiate the deal and keep us as a partner, he accepted Steve's offer of a 50 50 split. I was amazed Steve had called this exactly right. And so this is when we go into the surprising part, it's surprising to anybody that hasn't experienced this firsthand, but extremely common that if it happens a bunch of people, you might find yourself in this position one day. And I think reading its book and just knowing this, this exists in a bunch of forms is very helpful. It's the fact that he got everything possibly wanted. Could never expect, you know, that his, he created the world's first computer anime movie. It's one of the most successful movies of all time. His company is now a 50 50 partner with Disney, who he idolized since he was like 12. And yet he feels completely empty and adrift inside. And so he has to pick a new mission. So Ed's goal after Toy Story, after feeling, you know, down and depressed, how could we enable the talents of these people to keep them happy and not let the inevitable complexities that come with any collaborative endeavor undo us along the way? This was the job that I assigned myself, the mission that he assigns himself, and the one that still animates me to this day. And so that is the main crux of the book. It's like he's got all these ideas on how to make a sustainable creative environment. So I'm just going to pull out a couple ideas. This idea will stick with you. It is probably the two sentences of a sentence that I remember the most from reading this book five or six years ago. So talking about they started Toy Story 2, the movie was so bad, they had to fire the team, the director and the team and give it to I think John Lasseter fixes it, right? He is extremely painful, time consuming, expensive, I'm giving you the punchline here though, right? So it's like, remember that the spine of the story that Woody, his dilemma was to stay or to go was the same before and after that we worked on it. One version didn't work at all. And the other was deeply emotionally affecting to the audience. Why talented storytellers had found a way to make viewers care and the evolution of this story line made it abundantly clear to me. This is the maximum. This is the punchline. This is the most important part. If you give a good idea to a mediocre team, they will screw it up. If you give a mediocre idea to a brilliant team, they will either fix it or throw it away and come up with something better. The takeaway here is worth repeating. Getting the team right is the necessary precursor to getting the idea right. That insight that is people over everything, right? Go back to Steve Jobs idea. This is the only companies ever seen that has a team full of players. They're betting everything on the talent that they have. That idea causes him to completely redo the entire organization's structure of the company. Some points, even though they're creating movies and a brand new way no one's ever done before, they started copying some ways that other movie studios were set up. We think this doesn't make any sense. We had a development department that was charged with seeking out and developing ideas to make any films. Now I saw that this made no sense. The Nougal, find, develop and support good people and they in turn will find, develop and own good ideas. Now here's the problem though. You go all in on talent. Well, these super like A players, aggressive people, people that are completely addicted to their life's work and achieving excellence, right? They tend to be workaholics. That can be excessively dangerous. ([Time 0:34:33](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f01342b2-b169-4a07-a4f6-52f602b12bdc))
    - **Note:** Ed commits to creating a sustainable creative environment as his life’s mission. Instead of setting up like a movie studio he set up to leverage the natural resources at the company. Toy story 2 was getting fluffed so they fired the team and reinvented the whole movie. A mediocre team can destroy a great idea but a great team can make a good idea great or find a new idea and pivot to that. Quality is the best business plan it doesn’t matter the medium where you are you need to produce a high quality experience above all. Ed realized his group was incredibly ambitious and this lead them to invest everything in the company he was building for the long term so he made sure to create a better environment and balance the work life even when workers didn’t want to.

  Key takeaways:
  - Pixar films start off as terrible and become brilliant through the creative process.
  - Candor is important in providing feedback and improving the quality of ideas.
  - The best products come from within the creators themselves.
  - The brain trust provides honest critiques to bring out the true causes of problems.
  - Identifying too closely with your ideas can hinder growth and improvement.
  - Being wrong quickly and making decisions is preferable to indecisiveness.
  - Knowing your strengths and delegating is important for effective collaboration.
  - Candor overrides hierarchy at Pixar.
  - Business is filled with problems and challenges.
  - Problems are necessary and should be expected in the process.
  - Final products go through rapid changes and often bear no resemblance to the initial idea.
  - Iterative trial and error is valuable in the creative process.

  Speaker 1
  Pixar films are not good at first. All the movies we now think of as brilliant were at one time terrible, and this is as it should be. Creativity has to start somewhere. There is a basic truth. People who take on complicated creative projects become lost at some point in the process. It is the nature of things. And so he talks about you need to develop mechanisms inside your own companies to get you back on track. And so one thing they use and they repeat a lot throughout the book is the importance of candor. You attack the quality of the person's idea, not the person, but you cannot sugarcoat. Is this up to Pixar level quality or not? And because he preaches that, hey, all of our movies suck at first, no one takes offense. It is the nature of things. They are bad. Our job is to make them suck less. That is what we get paid to do. Another idea he has. The best products emerge from within their creator. We believe that the most promising stories are not assigned to filmmakers, but emerge from within them. Our directors make movies that they have conceived of and are burning to make. So they have this mechanism called the brain trust. They were from like five to like 30 different people. They'll meet with a director or filmmaker throughout the process. They'll review them and just give like very blunt candor, like critiques. Hey, you know, could you draw this better? Is this stories a little weak here? What are the case is? Now this is important part. The brain trust has no authority. The director does not have to follow any of the specific suggestions given. The brain trust notes are intended to bring the true causes of a problem to the surface, not to demand a specific remedy. That specific remedy has to come within the filmmaker. And if it doesn't, you have the wrong filmmaker. And so another thing that he preaches and repeats that you are not your idea. This is related. These are all related. They're in the same chapter. This principle alludes most people, but it is critical. You are not your idea. And if you identify too closely with your ideas, you will take offense when they are challenged. And so another great thing about the book is that he's working with all these like first-class directors and filmmakers. They're like almost like a team of founders and in and of themselves. And they say really fascinating things. And so I just want to pull out one here. This is the filmmaker Andrew Stanton. Andrew is fond of saying that you need to be as wrong as fast as you can. So get to the wrong answer as fast as you can. It's the way I would summarize what he's about to tell us here in a battle. If you're faced with two hills and you're unsure about which one to attack, he says, the right course of action is to hurry up and choose. If you find it's the wrong hill, then turn around and attack the other one. In that scenario, the only unacceptable course of action is running between the hills. You need to get to the wrong answer as fast as you can. Then he has a lesson that he learned from Steve Jobs. You need to know what you were best at. Steve believed that John and the story people knew more about narrative than he did, and he left it to them. At Apple, he had the reputation of being deeply involved in the most minute details of every product. But at Pixar, he didn't believe that his instincts were better than the people here. So he stayed out. Cander matters at Pixar. It overrides hierarchy. And so another great thing that he learned from Steve is that business is problems. Problems are inevitable. That's why I think the maximum that I learned from Henry Kaiser years ago that problems are just opportunities and workflows. It's such a fantastic maximum. They should be expected. And in fact, Steve says, if you don't have any problems, you should be very, very worried. At one point, Steve called me to check in on our progress. It's really strange, I told him. We haven't had a single big problem on this film. Many people would have been happy with this news, not Steve. Watch out, he said, that is a very dangerous place to be. And so Ed's takeaway from this is I came to think of our meltdowns or problems as a necessary part of doing our business, like investments in research and development. And so he keeps hitting on this idea that you should get used like things are going to suck, problems are notable. This is like business is problems. It's never going to go away. You have to get accustomed to this. And so he's going to talk about the fact that these final product products go through these like rapid changes. They go from sucking or the story's bad to like, you know, winning Oscars and making hundreds of millions of dollars. And I get to there's only like two or three sentences on these two pages I want to read to you. But it's fascinating because he's talking about a product. And I realized if you read a lot of biographies, this is true for people too. Anyone who's seen the movie knows that the final product bears no resemblance to that description. But what nobody knows is how many wrong turns the story took over a period of years before it found it's true north. This is true for people too. Or another way to think about accepting the error part of trial and error. The principle I'm describing here, iterative trial and error has long recognized value in science. I read that sentence and I thought of two things. Both of people I've done multiple multiple broadcasts on Thomas Edison. I have not failed. I just found 10,000 ways that won't work. And more importantly, I think better, more applicable to where we are specifically in this story is Edwin Land. ([Time 0:43:12](https://share.snipd.com/snip/14bd22ff-5a55-4eb4-b5b8-fa1bd46ea532))
    - **Note:** They start with the idea that the first cut of any movie sucks and they need to grow and attack the ideas not the people this is what lead to their success constant iteration and striving for greatness. They the brain trust would give feedback with candor to the director who could take it or leave it but they made it clear no one was their idea and everyone wanted the best outcome for the company. Get to the wrong answer as fast as you can. The only wrong answer is avoiding failure. Business is problems and problems are inevitable. Problems as a necessary part of learning. Iterative trial and error in business. Improving the process isn’t the goal making something great is don’t confuse or hide behind process. Companies and ecosystems need stress to grow shouldn’t be avoided.
- The Power of Imposing Limits and Setting Deadlines in Work
  Key takeaways:
  - Brad Bird wrote a speech that had a profound impact on Ed Campbell and continues to resonate with him.
  - The work of a critic is often easy and carries little risk, while those who create and expose their work face vulnerability.
  - Critics often thrive on negative criticism, but they must confront the reality that average creations may have more significance than their judgments.
  - A critic's true risk lies in championing and defending new talent and creations.
  - Imposing limits can be a valuable tool for pushing people to find alternative ways of working and to think smarter.
  - The demand for resources is limitless, so setting deadlines and establishing priorities become essential.
  - Creativity and exceptionalism are not about believing you are exceptional, but understanding your limitations.
  - Vision and creativity unfold gradually through persistent struggle and dedication.
  - An insightful metaphor from Andrew Stan emphasizes the need to embrace challenges and uncertainty in business endeavors.
  - To achieve goals, one must accept that they cannot control every aspect of the journey.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Brad Bird wrote this speech that he gives towards the end of the movie. And so it says the speech rocked me. This is Ed Campbell talking. He's like, that's speech rocked me. And to this day it sticks with me as I think about my work. And so he's going to quote from the movie. In many ways, the work of a critic is Edie. He's easy. We risk very little, yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating itself. But there are times when a critic truly risks something and that is in the discovery and the defense of the new. The world is often unkind to new talent to new creations. The new needs friends. He's got an entire section dedicated to what he calls the power of limits. He says limits that we impose internally can be a tool to force people to amend the ways they are working and to invent another way. We must think of smarter ways to work. Limit forces us to rethink how we are working. And this is why it's so important. The demand for resources is literally bottomless. Unless you impose limits, people will always justify spending more time and more money by saying we're just trying to make it a little better. It is impossible to do everything on your list. So you need to set a deadline, which then forces a priority based reordering of your list followed by the difficult discussion of what on this list is absolutely necessary. Another great line again, this book is full of them companies like individuals do not become exceptional by believing they are exceptional, but by understanding the ways in which they aren't exceptional. This is another great thought and something that you see in the arc of a human life through reading biographies. I've known many people I considered to be creative geniuses, yet I can't remember a single one who could articulate exactly what this vision was that they were striving for when they started it. Creative people discover and realize their visions over time and through dedicated protracted struggle. Going back to another piece of advice from these gifted filmmakers from this team of founders that he has around them, this is one of my favorite metaphors for building a business I have ever read. It stuck with me from years ago and it's from Andrew Stan. If you're sailing across the ocean and your goal is to avoid weather and waves, then why the hell are you sailing? You have to embrace a sailing means that you can't control the elements and that there will be good days and bad days and that whatever comes, you will deal with it because your goal is to eventually get to the other side. You will not be able to control exactly how you get across. That's the game you decided to be in. If your goal is to make it easier and simpler, then don't get in the fucking boat. I added that emphasis by the way that curse word is not in the book, but I think it just makes that fantastic metaphor even better.

    - **Note:** New ideas need friends and support. You become exceptional by correcting flaws. Creative people realize their vision over time and after struggle. If you go sailing there will be good days and storms but your goal is to get to the other side and weather these if your goal is to make it easy and simple don’t get in the boat because it won’t be. Eisner couldn’t work with jobs on a deal they were both too proud. Iger comes in makes Pixar the focus and is open and honest about the need to jobs and Steve likes this even though it’s bad negotiation and this helps get the deal done.

  Inevitably, Profiles of Steve describe him as a as stubborn and imperious and a man who held steadfastly who held steadfastly and unwavering to his own ideas, refusing to budge or change and who often tried to browbeat others into doing things his way. While many of the anecdotes people repeat about his behavior as a young executive are probably accurate, the overall portrait is way off the mark. This is a punchline. The reality is Steve changed profoundly in the years that I knew him. How could he not? Over 20 relentless learners, a relentless learner that refuses to quit. 26 years. He knew Ed Kamo. Of course he's going to change and get better at what he needs to do to accomplish his goals. The word genius is used a lot these days. Too much, I think. But with Steve, it's actually warranted. Still, when I first came to know him, he was frequently dismissive and brusque. This is the part of Steve that people love to write about. I realize that it is difficult to understand people who deviate so radically from the norm like Steve did. This narrative misses the most important story. And this is why I think the best biography of Steve Jobs I've ever written was as becoming Steve Jobs because it talks about the transformation that Ed got to witness firsthand. In the time I work with Steve, he didn't just gain the kind of practical experience you would expect to acquire while running two dynamic successful businesses. He also got smarter. He became fairer and wiser and his understanding of partnership deepened. This shift didn't lead him to abandon his famous commitment to innovation. It solidified it. And I think Pixar played a role in that development. Remember, in the late 1980s, when Pixar was founded, Steve was spending most of his time building next. At Pixar, none of us, including Steve, knew what we were doing. Steve would overreach in early negotiations with customers. And sometimes, this backfire. Steve had overreached his behavior would create ill will and later told me that he had learned from this. In those early days, Steve sensed that there was something quite special going on at Pixar, but it frustrated him that he couldn't figure it out. And he kept losing money in the meantime. And so this is something that Steve knew he had an expensive group that was ahead of its time. Could he hang this is something he didn't know? Could he hang on long enough for that potential to flower, especially if he didn't know if it would ever flower? What kind of person signs on for that? Would you that is one of the most important sentences in the entire book because it forces you to stop? Would you? Let's see. You got $70 million. You got next is not a successful business. And you dump 54 million into Pixar. And literally every month your partner comes up and ask you, Hey, Steve, here's the revenue. Here's expenses. You got to write another check to cover payroll. That's insane. Would you that's he's asking us? Would you? You got to stop and actually pause and think about it. It's insane that you did this. We tend to think of emotion and logic as two distinct mutually exclusive domains, not Steve. From the beginning, when making decisions, passion was a key part of his calculus at Pixar. Even when we were along away, we were long ways away from being in the black that aggressiveness was tempered by his acknowledgement that we knew things about graphics and storytelling that he did not. He respected our determination to be the first to make a computer animated feature. Even when we were unsure how to reach our goal, our passion was something Steve recognized and value. That's what Steve, John, and I ultimately bonded over passion for excellence. A passion so ardent, we were willing to argue and struggle and stay together even when things got extremely uncomfortable. Excellence is the capacity to take pain is the summary of that last paragraph. We bonded over a passion for excellence. The passion was so ardent, we were willing to argue and struggle and be in pain and stay together even when things got extremely uncomfortable. And we see that other people within Pixar were willing to push back into again lead with passion, I guess is the way to think about this. On the movie A Bug's Life, the marketing people were in conflict with the filmmakers. The filmmakers wanted the widescreen format because it led to a better experience in the theater. The marketers believing that consumers were less likely to buy a video with black bars on the top and bottom, argue that the widescreen format would mean a reduction in our DVD sales. Steve agreed with the marketing people. I took Steve around, a few weeks later, this happens. I took Steve around the offices so we could see some of the people working on A Bug's Life. The production designer was on the film was this guy named Bill Cone. Bill was showing some images that happened to be in the widescreen format. Steve interjected that it was nuts for us to be making a widescreen movie. Bill came right back at him, explaining why the widescreen format was absolutely crucial from an artistic standpoint. An intense back and forth followed. It got it was definitely heated. Later Bill came to see me looking rattled. Oh my God, I was just arguing with Steve Jobs. Did I blow it? On the contrary, I told him you won. Steve had responded to Bill's passion about the issue. The fact that Bill was willing to stand up so forcefully and articulate for what he believed and showed Steve that Bill's ideas were worthy of respect. Steve never raised the format issue with us again. Ed's point with that story is this is in direct conflict with what was a popular narrative. Remember, this book is written like a couple like two or three years after Steve Jobs died. Upon meeting Steve, people generally had to become accustomed to his style. Brad Bird, the filmmaker, remembers a meeting during the making of the movie The Incredibles soon after he joined the studio when Steve hurt his feelings by saying that some of the Incredibles artwork looked kind of quote Saturday morning, a reference to the low budget cartoons. In my world, that's kind of like saying your mama sleeps around, Brad said. I was seething. Brad came to understand though that Steve was speaking not as a critic, but as the ultimate advocate. The Incredibles he was implying had to reach higher. He was just saying that we have to show this is something bigger. And that epitomized Steve. Steve had a remarkable knack for letting go of things that didn't work. If you weren't an argument with him and you convinced him that you were right, he would instantly change his mind. He didn't hold on to an idea because he had once believed it to be brilliant. Perspective is so hard to capture. I work with Steve for more than a quarter century, longer I believe than anyone else. And I saw an arc to his life that does not accord with the one note portraits of relentless perfectionism that have read in magazines, newspapers, and even his own authorized biography, relentless Steve, the borish, brilliant, but emotionally tone deaf guy that we first came to know changed into a different man during the last two decades of his life.

    - **Note:** Steve was constantly learning and growing he was very stubborn but in this time it was clear Pixar was special but it needed to be figured out how to productize it. His brash style was often talked about but his openness to change that shaped his return to Apple discovered in these years and molded isn’t as oft talked about. Steve kept dumping money in he knew it was special and it took decades but this investment made him a billionaire. Excellence is the capacity to take pain. Steve was willing to fight and stand up for his crazy ideas but was just as willing to listen to others and change his mind when he was wrong but you needed to stand up to him and explain it clearly. Steve was willing to quickly let go of an idea with no attachment when it’s clear he was wrong. He developed and became truly wise in this era.
