### Highlights

- When were young we think he can conquer the world but outside factors like disease limits us and we must to live with those circumstances without regret. The world isn’t built for us we must renounce some wishes fate may forbid things and it takes courage in this moment to turn away without regret. Submitting to these powers is the peak of wisdom to curate happiness and acceptance in hardship. This is the great renunciation when we give up unattainable dreams of youth without regret. You must kill your soul and desire in order to achieve growth. The individual soul must struggle against a universe of darkness. Through living justly in the outside world life begins a new. We need to rise above what we can’t control death and illness in order to rise above and achieve enlightenment and conquer these evils. Life is short and we must conquer fate. We don’t bow before the inevitable but absorb it look for eternal happiness and desire not transitory thing. This emancipation and the free man’s worship. This liberation requires us to contemplate our fate. Love is the peak of happiness and success in this brief life. Cultivate inner control despite external events.
- Russell believed in science over religion and didn’t believe in life after death. Good and evil don’t cast any light on the non human world. He’s rejecting the great cause and effect idea of the universe for one of atoms and randomness. Nature oppresses everyone but only humans have the ability and sentience to shape nature to their will and create things that are guided by purpose not randomness. The idea of satisfying jealous gods through hate and violence is bad and it’s a moloch problem. They don’t even ask if the gods are worthy of worship. Man is free to examine and create. Resist outside forces and take agency in ways others can’t. Us giving our minds to an unexamined religion creates a religion of molach. Gives violence and hate to satisfy fake gods and gives up agency. This makes us slaves who blindly worship power. We can’t blindly worship power. We should worship goodness not force that creates evil. It’s our choice to worship in either way. Reject outside power to create an inner freedom to worship the god of the good. Embrace truth and fact not belief. Freedom comes to those who take life by the horns not expect things to be given to them in life.

    - **Note:** Russell believes in science over religion and taking agency in your life, and that humans are very creative and intelligent, and we shouldn’t rely on religion to tell us what to do when we can design our own world. We have the ability to make sense of randomness, seek truth and remain critical.
- The good life is inspired by love and guided by knowledge. Views the good life as something done at a society not individual level. The good life needs to be good for everyone not internal stoic beliefs but Roman freedom. The good life cannot be hacked but must be built through dedicated commitment to a better holistic society. Bad desires are those that make society worse as a whole like prostitution leading to the spreading of std for individual happiness. Avoid active malevolence this comes from increasing fear of others and increasing courage. We need to avoid irrational fear created by people who are scared of losing jobs or lives so create hate we need to rid ourselves of this fear but not rational fear like running from a fire. We must motivate by hope not fear. Active optimism over racism and nationalism. We need people with the courage to shape the world not run in fear from it. Courage doesn’t need to be from war but can be developed on a situation like from poverty or failure. Envy is bad and we need to avoid envy by making peoples lives better holistically so they are happier and avoid envious feelings Charlie munger in envy. We need to allow envy to be only with respect to performance and act as motivation to lift people up not to put them down. Make the world better.

    - **Note:** Say the good life as a societal thing that must be built through hard work and that anything bad for a part was bad for the whole. he wanted to avoid irrational fear and cultivate actives optimism by increasing courage wanted to create a fearless world where people took chances and were brave not envious. Using failure only as motivation and everyone acting correctly not ill-willied. Avoid envy be courageous in all acts.
- We only hate things that go against nature when they’re new. We fear novelty and change. We need to live with nature sometimes our discoveries go against what is best for our nature and we must continue to learn when we make change but nonetheless embrace its. Life should leave room for adventure not get stuck in routine. We should embrace nature in so far it makes our lives better but we should cultivate freedom from routine and room to think. We must dominate nature through superior invention that makes our life better. Embrace new tech and creation over everything seek to shape the world and make it better for everyone through invention.

- He is pushing a life free from men’s power and the mutual right of consent and birth control speaking against church beliefs around kids. He takes the modern approach of not raising kids in poverty giving them a good home in order to not create resentment and other negative externalities. Also advocates for divorced when. If the rules can only be obeyed against the will of the many rules must be broken and changed. The church forcing negative externalities is evidence of its great power and seen by the church as a good thing and their coercive powers. Prison should be not about punishment as much as about reform don’t make prison worse make society and freedom better deter don’t punish and execute.

    - **Note:** Russell is using the ideas of modern times and applying them earlier in the historical lifecycle when they were less consensus. He believes in raising kids in homes that aren't broken and giving everyone a chance breaking rules well and inverting the world not to make the disincentives greater for coercion but the incentives and life better for cooperation. Big independent thinking and questioning reality
- Humans are at the mercy of nature for almost everything except what we value and our values. We can’t transcend the laws of physics or chemistry but we can transcend our animal instincts to live at a higher level of human development we have agency over our minds not our environment. We define what the good life is and can achieve it. Love and knowledge are two vital forces. Love without knowledge lacks progress but is more important than knowledge without love which is war. Still you rather go to a doctor you don’t know than have your mom do surgery. Community is important you need to balance love and knowledge. Defenders of traditional morals rarely have warm hearts but see morals as a way to inflict pain behind the guise of morality and this is evil.

    - **Note:** Knowledge vs love having both is important love is lower on the stack and a more core need but this balance is needed in life and creation
      Humans are at the mercy of the world for everything but their minds. We have full agency over what we think and believe. Transcend animal instincts. We can design and live our ideal life.
      People who cling to morality to justify action are usually not great people if you need morality to justify action like the crusades you’re likely immoral.
      Knowledge vs love morality to justify action agency over our minds.
