### Highlights

- America that narcissism and sociopathy are illnesses in today's America narcissism and sociopathy are strategies and they're successful strategies in contemporary Society it is effective for us to be constantly focused on ourselves and monitoring our performance and self-image to be so fixated on promoting ourselves is to never let your guard down to
  compulsively market and improve yourself in the hopes of one day perfecting your self- project this constant self-reference develops into a rat race within oneself and eventually it could lead to burnout or what Young chhan describes as eye tiredness the ego grows exhausted and wears itself down such tiredness stems from the redundancy and recurrence of the ego we exhaust ourselves with ourselves evidently burnout is more often than not treated as an annoyance
  or a failure in mastering oneself fully it is seen as a weakness and should be treated immediately lest we run the risk of falling short of our journey towards self-optimization but I think burnout and depression should be seen more as the very symptoms of this compulsion for achievement in weariness of the self aronberg points to this achievement society as the root of this rise in depression depression began its Ascent when the disciplinary model for Behavior broke against norms then invited us to
  undertake personal initiative by enjoining us to be ourselves the depressed individual is unable to measure up he is tired of having to become himself it is this voluntary self- exploitation that gives rise to a Fractured Soul we experience severe dislocation a loss of connection with ourselves and others as we compulsively strive for self-perfection depression and burnout are simply the canaries in the coal mine in terms of demonstrating the D destructiveness of such an achievement culture this is not
  to suggest that self-improvement or the striving to be a better person is inherently maladaptive such a journey is healthy and often beneficial however we should pay close attention to when such a process collapses into a hellish cycle of excessive self-reference and exhaustion it is more than likely that such an outcome is the result of self-exploitation rather than healthy intrinsically motivated self-improvement alienation is inevitable when our inner sense of value becomes status-driven
  hinging on externally imposed standards of competitive achievement and acquisition and a highly conditional Acceptance in others eyes we struggle to answer the question who am I and this is an important question to answer if we wish to ever truly improve ourselves ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqcbm6kwmhsmd5accqf5me16))
    - **Note:** We become depressed because we can never realize ourselves as who we want to be and we’re stuck chasing ourselves in an unhealthy external status driven way that leads to failure. This creates a fractured soul.
- Freedom alone can nonetheless leave us unhappy alienated and vulnerable to authoritarianism negative Freedom the
  absence of constraints does not bring us closer to solving the question of who we are we live under the illusion that we know what we want but as from argues the sad fact of the matter is that we want that which we are supposed to want this I would argue is at the root of compulsive self-improvement we have become automatons who live under the illusion of being self-will individuals he lives in a world to which he has lost genuine relatedness and in which everybody and everything has become instrumental ized where he has become
  part of the machine that his hands have built fromm's cure is simple spontaneity seen in both artists and children spontaneous activity does not abide by rigid self-optimization and Improvement instead it is an Embrace of activity for the sake of the activity itself art play time with friends and a gradual slowing down flies in the very face of the sorts of self-improvement that lead to burnout as from writes spontaneous activity is
  the one way in which man can overcome the terror of aloneness without sacrificing the Integrity of the self for in the spontaneous realization of the self man unites himself a new with the world this partially relies on truly giving attention to the moment through active listening and observing the gift of listening as B Chelan observes is entirely inaccessible to the hyperactive ego which must close itself off in order to constantly measure and optimize itself any disruption from the outer
  world is considered to be a threat to achieving our potential to listen is to open oneself up to themselves and the world around them our world has made us increasingly focused on ourselves as a project this has made us rigid and incapable of spontaneity it is only in those moments of intrinsic Focus where we are doing things for themselves in which we can escape the burnout Society call it a flow State spontaneity or resonance we find ourselves alive only when we risk destabilizing our journey
  towards self-perfection here I think bertron Russell gives us the most succinct path forward in combating self-absorption the secret of happiness is this let your interests be as wide as possible and let your reactions to the things and persons that interest you be as far as possible friendly rather than hostile ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqcbvkgfc8dkqdfnaveg1mfy))
    - **Note:** The cure is to live a spontaneous life where you’re not hyper focused on yourself and what’s in your world, but introducing randomness and fun into your daily activities getting into flow and just kind of shooting from the hip. To become ourselves need to relinquish control over ourselves, so we can discover who we really are, and only there in the service of others, and the fond of ourselves. Do we really discover ourselves. ￼
- elling people what they should do this new form of control tells people what they can do this is smart power a power that compels people to subject themselves to power relations completely on their own accord rather than inhibiting or repressing smart power motivates us to self-optimize rather than a disciplinary Society we now live in an achievement Society instead of the tireless surveillance of disciplinary societies that measure and observe their subject s in order to optimize productivity we
  have now taken surveillance into our own hands motivated by the need to improve ourselves we use apps ranking systems and Health Data to determine if we are self-optimizing enough the auto exploiting subject carries around its own labor camp as a self-illuminating self- surveilling subject it Bears its own internal panopticon within the digitalized networked subject is a panopticon of itself this ensures that
  each and every person has now taken on the task of conducting Perpetual Autos surveillance this is far more efficient than the techniques used in a disciplinary Society if we see ourselves as a project that can always be worked on there is always more for us to do not only do we take on the task of monitoring and measuring ourselves we also feel compelled to constantly improve ourselves under the idea that this is fundamentally good for us as an entrepreneur of himself the neoliberal
  achievement subject engages in Auto exploitation willingly and even passionately the self as a work of art amounts to a beautiful but deceptive illusion that the neoliberal regime maintains in order to exhaust its resources entirely we are then capable of unlimited self- production making ourselves into better and better marketable Commodities by making sure we are for example in shape have an attractive partner and are making enough money
  and this involves more than mere career aspirations physical optimization means more than aesthetic practice alone sexiness and fitness represents New Economic resources to be increased marketed and exploited this compulsive drive to improve ourselves under this idea of our self as a project can now take over our entire lives this pressure to achieve to be more and do more leads to a sort of culturally induced narcissism ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqcbbynwnw595mpp92q4hd6h))
    - **Note:** The curse of the never ending treadmill where we exploit ourselves for our own gain passionately and willingly to our own detriment
