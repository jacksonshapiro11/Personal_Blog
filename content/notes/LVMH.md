### Highlights

- In 1940s europe the French fashion industry was copted by the nazis and Christian Dior had to design these nazi speced clothes. After the war Dior gets financed by a man to go and design himself. His designed are so ornate and creative using luxury fabrics it instantiates a new era in fashion. It’s all about the creativity of the designer to produce these unique expensive products with fine materials. Creates radical divergent mind. There are protests against this. This is a smash hit.
  The brand creates so much value they start to license it’s use. 100% gross margin as long as you don’t devalue the brand.
  Dior dies and usually the company would die but they have this designer named yves st Lauren who takes over and completely modernized the brand and look. This signaled the change from fashion as artists to fashion as an industry with companies.

    - **Note:** Dior was stuck designing more time close but when the war ends, he’s developing these ornate patterns that rejects the austerity of wartime when he dies his fashion house lives on through other great designers, which was rare. This was the start of luxury brands really. Demonstrating cycles in life.
- The guy who owned dior bussec didn’t like the radical creation and forced st Lauren out this killed the company choosing conservatism over creativity. The company filed for bankruptcy twice and is basically run by the French government.
  Bernard auround comes from a family of engineers. He studied at the prestigious École polytechnique which is a hardcore engineering school where you study 2 years just to take the entrance exams. Very strong engineering background
  France became socialist so he left to go to America with no connections or plan and sells condos in palm beach before moving to new Rochelle and he ends up living next to the richest man in the world at the time through lbos. He learns how profitable lbos could be and brings it back to France.

    - **Note:** St Lauren was magic and revived Dior and letting him go killer it socialism led to a brain drain Bernard was super smart was in the right place and time and Forced connections rode a wave. Applied ideas across fields cross disciplinary.
- He does an lbo of the dior conglomerate. Fires half the workers makes it a cash cow 100mn in fcf from 60mm price and 15mm of his own capital. Spins off ancillary business. Knocks it out of the park. They then make 500mm off these sales. Finds market inefficiencies and then finds immense value because of market technicals.
  Find brands that are timeless and growing - the power of luxury.
  Moet and Hennessy merge then Louis vitton merge with that company. It used to be that only kings and queens can afford luxury but as global wealth increases anyone can afford luxury a professional business person took over at 10xed revenue was previously only family run. Goes from 12mm to 1bn through globalization and luxury and realizes you need to control distribution.
  The companies have 2 different structures and hard headed leaders and as a result they can’t coexist. Leads to their downfall as family owned. So there is a schism between the drinks side and luxury side. They invite aurnaud in from the Louis side because he’s a goods guy.

    - **Note:** Bernard takes his opportunities when he’s acquiring Dior or Louis Vuitton. He sees a structural mispricing and pounces. He also rides the wave of globalization and private equity. He’s at the right place at the right time for many things. Compounds like crazy
- He us able to use financial engineering at many levels to get capital without giving up control. He makes a deal with Guinness to get majority control of the minority stake and basically stabs the Louis guy in the back. Despite him creating the luxury playbook. Careful who you ally with. Guiness gives them the fire power to continue to buy lvmh and take a majority stake. 
  The two heads of the business want to disband the holding company and think that what he wants is the Dior perfume business. They underestimated him and didn’t realize he wanted to run all of lvmh. He continues to acquire shares and basically mortgages the Dior business in his fight to win lvmh. He is able to get to 35% which is a blocking minority in France so he has control. He wants to create a fashion empire and control it and change the industry. They couldn’t understand his motivations. 
  He’s not a corporate raider but he wants to build an enduring business but he does this through raiding. This story is about how important control is.
- Luxury business are great margins because high price and low cogs. He made a large scale business but you need to limit supply so he synergized the business by owning multiple brands. So you get scale economies without brand dilution. Finding where to find synergies in luxury this was a massive unlock. The talent is the key. The can attract the top creative talent which needs to be focused on brand and business team that can flow across the organization you get the best of both worlds. So this allows people to move up in different brands. Deep understanding of power in luxury. They go on a brand buying spree. They also crafted the customer experience and owned the store within a store.
  Owned the experience gotta know what you’re selling which is really a dream and craft the customer experience. You need to know why the memetic luxury experience.
  They want to own the full chain and even acquired distributors like Sephora and duty free.

    - **Note:** Bernard understood there are scale economies in luxury but not at the brand level and has been very good at keeping the unique differentiation of the brand while also optimizing what is commoditized and building an organization of deep creative thinkers who can pivot between brands cross disciplinary. This allows patience and cultivation
      Deep understanding of craft to do this luxury is a high margin business because you’re not selling a good but status and a lifestyle which makes cultivating your brand vital.
      He owned the distribution and everything along the way which was vital.
- Luxury transcend needs without having any real functional benefit. Bring creativity and social power as well as history. There are premium goods where you pay more for more quality luxury is paying because it offers no more value you buy it because of what it says about you not that you need it for any reason. Buying the dream. You show you’re willing to spend money on almost nothing which exudes wealth. Luxury is a necessity that begins where necessity ends - coco Chanel. It’s all social signaling. Essential part of the human condition. Durability of status. Bernaurd is the combo of quality and creativity.
  Globalization tailwind between Japan and China. Riding a wave.

    - **Note:** Riding a wave of globalization. Premium vs luxury goods. Buying status and social signaling. Luxury begins and is necessary where necessity ends.
- Bernard walks away from the Gucci deal saying that it was worth $0. Then Gucci which was falling apart promtes a young designer named Tom ford who completely jumpstarts the brand. They continue to pass on acquiring Chanel on price and the company in a desperate act of control gets outside funding and as a result lvmh created its largest competitor because they got too price sensitive.
  Operating margins expand and they have high margins. Basically a tech company. Using the power of brand lvmh has acquired Tiffani and teamed up with people like Rihanna and Jay z to build brands.
  At group level they have scale economies and some brand value at lvmh. Cornered resource of star brands.
  At the brand level there is brand power.
  Don’t advertise the product advertise the dream. Luxury is the intersection of art and commerce.
  He realized the importance of brand value
