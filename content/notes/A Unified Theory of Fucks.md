- Full Title: A Unified Theory of Fucks
- Category: #articles

- Summary: The author of the article discusses their theory of "fucks," which refers to the idea that individuals are born with a finite amount of things to care about. The author notes that it is impossible to manufacture or buy more "fucks," but one can receive them as a gift from others. They argue that giving "fucks" to living things, like people, animals, and the environment, is more meaningful than giving them to unliving institutions or systems. The author concludes that good work involves giving a "fuck" about the living and that everyone has the ability to do good work.

### Highlights

- I used to tell this story, about my theory of fucks. The theory goes like so: you are born with so many fucks to give. However many you’ve got is all there is; they are like eggs, that way. Some of us are born with quite a lot, some with less, but none of us knows how many we have. When we’re young, we go around giving a fuck about all kinds of things, blissfully unaware of our ever-dwindling supply. Until one day, we give the last fuck we’ve got, and we notice that the invisible bag of fucks we’ve been carrying around all these years is finally, irredeemably, empty. We have no more fucks left to give. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnvg3r2pjvr0qp81nv4namfz))

    - **Note:** You have a finite amount of fucks to give so you can only give fucks in mutual relationships where people can give fucks back. If you care about things you can't control you'll be emotionally drained and broken. When people give a fuck about you your amount of finite fucks gets added to. Life is about relationships and giving the fucks about the people who deserve it and maybe you get some back
      You only have so much mental bandwidth and you need to expend it wisely and do things that give you energy. People can fill up our bag of fucks and give us energy. We must find these people.
- This is one of my answers to the question of, why give a fuck about work? Why *love* your work? It won’t, of course, [love you back](https://aworkinglibrary.com/reading/work-wont-love-you-back). It can’t. Work isn’t a thing that can love. It isn’t alive, it isn’t and won’t ever be *living.* And my answer is: *don’t.* Don’t give a fuck about your work. *Give all your fucks to the living.* Give a fuck about the people you work with, and the people who receive your work—the people who use the tools and products and systems or, more often than not, are used by them. Give a fuck about the land and the sea, all the living things that are used or used up by the work, that are abandoned or displaced by it, or—if we’re lucky, if we’re persistent and brave and willing—are cared for through the work. Give a fuck about yourself, about your own wild and tender spirit, about your peace and especially about [your art](https://everythingchanges.us/blog/energy-makes-time/). Give every last fuck you have to living things with beating hearts and breathing lungs and open eyes, with chloroplasts and mycelia and water-seeking roots, with wings and hands and leaves. Give like every fuck might be your last. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnvgndvb58h528qzff30gyw1))
    - **Note:** don't care about abstract things but tangible things and people
- Because here’s what I’ve learned: if you give your fucks to the unliving—if you plant those fucks in institutions or systems or platforms or, gods forbid, interest rates—you will run out of fucks. One day you will reach into that bag and your hand will meet nothing but air and you will be bereft. You will realize the loss of something you did not know you ever had. But if you give a fuck about the living, about all your living kin in all the kingdoms, *they will give a fuck right back.* Maybe not every one of them; maybe not every time. Some people’s bags have been empty for a long while, and they may feel the need to ration whatever they have; some people have been taught that to give a fuck is to lose something, not realizing that to withhold is what it means to lose. But I believe—I know from having given and received, from having lost and been renewed—that enough of them will come back that you can keep on giving, for a while at least, for as long as any of us has time to give.
  That’s what work is, after all. Work—the action of change, the movement of energy from one being to another—is the means by which fucks are granted. *Good work is the art of giving a fuck about the living.* And all of us, every day, are faced with good work that needs doing, and good work that we can do.

    - **Note:** It's ok if your bags are empty or near empty but you need to keep giving fucks to people in the right way
