### Highlights

- The Importance of Having Good Taste
  Key takeaways:
  - Paul writes a lot about the advantages that small teams and small companies have over larger ones, but there's also disadvantages.
  - In a big company, you can do what all the other big companies are doing, but a startup can't do what all other startups do.
  - A small company can actually succeed by only me. They actually only need to be good at one thing.
  - When we started VioWeb, we had no experience in business. We didn't know anything about marketing or hiring people or raising money or getting customers. Neither of us even had what you call real job.
  - The only thing we were good at was writing software and we hoped that would save us.
  - And then he talked about some other good ideas they did when he was building a startup. One, they focused on speed. Our development cycle was so fast that we could sometimes duplicate a new feature within a day or two of a competitor announcing it in a press release. And he said a key to that was they had a technical advantage.
  - He talks a lot about this book, in this book about programming languages. I've admitted this. He felt that the fact that they used this unknown but really advanced programming language called LISP was a massive advantage to VioWeb.
  - He thinks LISP was that for them.
  - We see an idea that you and I have talked about over and over again bad boys move in silence for hundreds of years.

  Paul writes a lot about the advantages that small teams and small companies have over larger ones, but there's also disadvantages. And one thing that startups cannot or small companies cannot afford to do is not focus. And so he has this idea that you should ignore what other people are doing and consider only what will work best. In a big company, you can do what all the other big companies are doing, but a startup can't do what all other startups do. I don't think a lot of people realize this even in startups. Then he goes into the fact that a small company can actually succeed by only me. They actually only need to be good at one thing. When we started VioWeb, we had no experience in business. We didn't know anything about marketing or hiring people or raising money or getting customers. Neither of us even had what you call real job. The only thing we were good at was writing software and we hoped that would save us. And then he talked about some other good ideas they did when he was building a startup. One, they focused on speed. Our development cycle was so fast that we could sometimes duplicate a new feature within a day or two of a competitor announcing it in a press release. And he said a key to that was they had a technical advantage. He talks a lot about this book, in this book about programming languages. I've admitted this. He felt that the fact that they used this unknown but really advanced programming language called LISP was a massive advantage to VioWeb. He says, in business, there is nothing more valuable than a technical advantage your competitors don't understand. You read that again, in business, there's nothing more valuable than a technical advantage your competitors don't understand. He thought LISP was that for them. And we see an idea that you and I have talked about over and over again bad boys move in silence for hundreds of years of the history of entrepreneurship. We see people they have an edge and they shut up about it. I never said anything publicly about LISP while we work on VioWeb. This was no accident. A startup should give its competitors as little information as possible. Okay, so now I want to jump to Paul's essay called Taste for Makers. He says, I was talking recently to a friend who teaches at MIT. His field is hot now. He's writing this back in 2002. His field is hot now and every year he is inundated by applications from would-be graduate students. A lot of them seem smart, he said. What I can't tell is whether they have any kind of taste. Taste. You don't hear that word much now. And yet we still need the underlying concept, whatever we call it. Well, my friend meant was that he wanted students who were not just good technicians but who could also use their technical knowledge to design beautiful things. For those of us who design things, these are not just theoretical questions. We need good taste to make good things. Let's try considering it as a practical question. How do you make good stuff? So again, I think all this ties together, right? He says, how do you know what to work on? Once you know what to work on, how do you make something great? Why is that important? Because if when you make great things or good things that other people find valuable, that is how you build wealth. All of these ideas connect across multiple decades and I don't know, 100 different essays. It's really remarkable and I don't know if I that would have clicked if I haven't spent, you know, last few weeks not only reading through his entire website but also picking up this book and reading this as well. So back to this idea of taste. Remember, this is taste for makers. If you mention taste nowadays, a lot of people will tell you that quote, taste is subjective. They believe this because it really feels that way to them. Saying that taste is just personal preference is a good way to prevent disputes. The trouble is, it's not true. You feel this when you start to design things. Whatever job people do, they naturally want to do it better. Football players like to win games, CEOs like to increase earnings.

    - **Note:** Bad boys move in silence and having good taste.
