  Seven pillars of life is a way that I created feedback loop for myself on how I'm showing up in my life and at least creating a point of reflection to improve it. And the reason why I designed this is a long time ago, I went through a challenging time with my fiance and that didn't work out, but then I got married and I don't know about you, but people get divorced and it's kind of crazy. And you're just like, why do they get divorced? Why are they having challenges in their lives? And typically it's because there's a fracture and then the fracture lasts for weeks and then months and then eventually a year and the fracture ends up creating such a wide divide that they can't repair it. So what I've done is across these seven core pillars, it's actually a bonus chapter. I wasn't even going to include in the book and my editor was like, Hey, I really think the seven pillars would be a great tool for everybody to just wrap it all up. And every Friday morning I sit down for 30 minutes. It doesn't even take me 30 minutes. It takes me like five or six, but I rate myself out of 10 on these seven pillars. This is a spreadsheet. I've been doing it for years. And the seven categories are health, hobbies, spirituality, friends, love, finance and mission. And I do those ones because they encompass kind of like how I want to show up in the world. Spirituality is important. It doesn't matter if you believe in God or whatever God or the universal consciousness or spirit or energy, whatever it is, just asking yourself, do you have a relationship? Are you spiritual? Are you meditating? Whatever it is. And like just giving yourself a rating on those things, finances. Like a lot of people, they don't want to talk about money. They don't pay attention to their money. And then they wonder why they have none or like hobbies. People like, Oh, hobbies must be nice. It's like, Look, all I know is that after I go snowboarding with my buddies, I'm a better dad. I'm a better husband. I recharge. I connect. I want to do those things. So what happens is I score myself on those seven pillars. I'll actually give you today's. That's always better real time. So today I scored myself pretty high. I'm having a good time right now. My two lowest scores. One was friends and the other one was hobby. So here's the bonus one of this. I got an eight and a seven. I always write in the spreadsheet a note on how to fix it. So the hobby one is book a snow biking. So I do this crazy thing called snow biking. And then the friends one is low, but the good news is I go snow biking with my friends. So I'm going to get a double whammy. And all I did the action, that's why I give myself 30 minutes to do this. I just made a list of all the dates that I'm free to go snow biking. And then I sent a text message to my five friends that I go snow biking with and says, Hey guys, can we just schedule one of these days ago, snow biking? And I've accomplished it. Literally it's that simple. It's just every week I assess myself on those seven dimensions. I take my two lowest scores, if it's love, because I haven't been there for my wife, it might be then I set a commitment to take action in the next seven days. And that one might be like schedule a date night, give my wife night off on Monday, let her take a bath, whatever it is. And because I do that Chris, I just feel like I get to live a higher quality of life because I'm not trying to fix things because there's a fracture that's been going on way too long around not seeing my friends or not taking care of my health or not focusing on my mission or whatever it is. And it's been a big part of my life. ([Time 1:14:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/27da7b5a-19ae-483e-9154-e226d910dc02))
