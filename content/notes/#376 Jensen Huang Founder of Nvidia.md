### Highlights

- Excellence is the capacity to take pain. His parents are in Taiwan see the is as the land of opportunity and want to get their sons there. They send them to live with their aunt and uncle in Washington and sell all their possessions to send them to boarding school in the us but it’s actually a reform school for troubled youths. This helps shape Jenson’s ability to take pain. He believes his ability to be successful and get promoted faster that others is his willingness and resilience. He puts in more effort and tolerance more suffering. People with high expectations have low resilience. Greatness comes from not intelligence but character which is his ability to to tolerate and grow through pain and suffering. Choose conflict over agreement leads to more success. Opportunity handled well leads to more opportunity. He’s working at lsi systems and this is where he meets his cofounders. Every single job he does the best he can leads to more opportunities. When he leaves lsi the ceo asks to invest and introduces him to Don valintine.

  And that is excellence is the capacity to take pain. Jensen has unfathomable levels. I have not discovered the end of his capacity to take pain. He talks about this a lot. So there's two things that actually happen at the reform school I think are really important. One, the school holds the students to a very strict routine, and you have to work every single day, which Jensen does and loves to do now. The other thing that was beneficial to him that probably didn't feel beneficial at the time is that the first few months Jensen was smaller and younger than all of his classmates and They beat the crap out of him. His roommate at the boarding school was eight years older than Jensen and they said, there's a great description of him in the book, that he's covered in tattoos and scars from stab wounds. And so after getting his ass kicked a bunch, they wind up like finding his footing, gaining respect. He's obviously somebody that's not going to back down from a fight. And Jensen, much later on in life, is talking about this formative experience going to the school. And he says, as a result of this experience, I don't get scared often. I don't worry about going places I haven't gone before. I can tolerate a lot of discomfort. So then the next thing I want to talk to you about is I want to fast forward. And at this point, we find Jensen is already graduated college. He is working for a microchip company. It's AMD, Advanced Micro Devices. And this is just his capacity ([Time 0:09:02](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c172133c-a792-495a-a72e-80de0c10da08))
- Reputation is vital he pitches sequia and they decide to invest not because the pitch was good because it was terrible but because Jenson has an amazing reputation. Jenson is very self critical ruthlessly self critical. He realizes he tries to make a horizontal solution first but people only want vertical. No one buys a Swiss Army knife they just get it for Christmas. People need focus. Product positioning. What the product does and who is it for. He’s terrible first 5 years 2 products fail has to learn and reinvent the company fire most of the company. Here he learns to move fast. They had no money they had to move fast. The great leaders are teachers. Nvidia is Jenson with 10k lives. He is a force of nature. Makes the company in his image. He values the white board where people need to prove out ideas clearly in front of everyone which exposes them or shows their learning. Flat organization structure. The biggest issue is people moving too slow. That’s why people leave. Has 60 direct reports people try to get him to change but it was the right fit for him so it didn’t change.

  And you can go see these YouTube videos where he actually testifies in front of Congress. You'll see that Buffett for probably over four decades talks about the fact that you're, you have to be very, you should be making all your decisions that protect your long term reputation In mind. In fact, when Buffett is testifying in front of Congress, when that he was going to the Salomon Brothers scandal, he talks about the fact that he told he's telling the congressman that He told everybody inside the organization that if you lose, you can lose money for the firm. I won't be understanding. You lose a single shred of reputation and I will be ruthless. He put that into the congressional record. And again, I think he talks about the fact that the reason is, is because if you're making decisions with the importance of your long-term reputation in mind, that's going to pay dividends. And it can also destroy and and abort future opportunities if you have a bad reputation jensen says the same thing it's like it's a lesson that jensen would never forget your reputation Will precede you obviously it pays ([Time 0:20:32](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2929f06f-615b-4b01-b208-fdb6da5c0948))
- Very critical tortures people to greatness will criticize someone in front of the entire company because he sees it as a learning experience he’ll do this to himself too. Complacency kills extreme self confidence and charisma with inner voice that says he sucks. He thinks he sucks despite his success. He doesn’t judge the company based on past performance but judges everyone by the speed of light. Focus on maximum effort minimum time. Unapologetically extreme. He cuts development time from 18 months to 6. Works every day including weekends finds it relaxing. Focuses on top 5 emails which are top 5 things someone is working on they see in the market ect. Helps to get early signal anyone can send it and he’ll read it. Strategy isn’t what he says it’s what people do. Helps him see at the edge. This is how he saw machine learning early. Email culture. If you get an investment he’ll respond immediately. Information from the edge. Blunt clear and short communication. Must compress thoughts into simplest feedback.

  Again, Jensen is going to hold up the highest. He's going to hold the work as the quality of the work as the most important. So I don't want to seem like a crazy obsessed person, even though I definitely am. I play. I play the documentary, The Last Dance in the background while I work. And The Last Dance is obviously about Michael Jordan and the final season with the Bulls. And there's actually that was going over the outline and reading the book while this is playing in the background. And there's actually a line in the documentary where one of Jordan's teammates is describing Jordan. And because I was like eyeballs deep in the world of Jensen the past few weeks, at the same time, I'm rewatching the documentary. I was like, oh, this sounds just like Jensen. So this is Jordan's teammate describing Michael. Michael wanted to be the best player on the best team. He's raising his voice. He's calling guys out. He's talking about how he's treating his teammates, right? He's raising his voice. He's calling guys out. So we're not playing well as a team. We're lazy. He's not worried about hurting your feelings. If he did, you could leave. He would gladly tell you, you don't want to play hard? Fine. Get out. And then right after this, is explaining this leadership style and why he played the game the way he did and i feel like there's an echo of of of jensen jensen is not trying to be like oh just You know just another founder he's trying to be the best of the best to create a company that nobody else on the planet could create and he has done that.

- He believes the company exists to achieve a mission, not to perpetuate itself. Leader keeps the company on the core objective. Strategy isn’t words it’s action. They don’t do 5 year plans just continuous planning. Steer the boat everyday the world is too complex. Independent thinking. No central planning. Overpays for top talent. He awards rsu for clear tangible things done at random points throughout the year not at the end. Makes people feel good in the moment. Will give outsized rewards for outsized impact. Very detail oriented. Built an organization for him. Believes his biggest challenge is complacency it kills. All successful people hates complacency. Hates resting on laurels just focuses on what’s next. We are defined by our actions by what we repeatedly do. Excellence is a habit.

  So number 12, the mission is the boss and pilot in command. I think he really picked up on the fact that as you build an organization, over time, as it grows, it starts to exist for the sake of perpetuating itself. And he's like, no, no, no. We want a flat organization. One, we want to just focus on the mission. But as the mission changes, and if you read the book, and you obviously clearly, they started on the video game industry. What are they doing now? They're dominating the artificial intelligence industry. Like that is because he had this flat, fast, reactive culture and organization, and he can switch the mission and then take all the resources onto that new mission. This is what Jensen says. The concept of the mission is the boss makes a lot of sense because ultimately we're here to realize a particular mission, not in service of some organization.

- Ship the whole cow. They instead of throwing out bad or slow chips repurpose to another product line and sell way below market but this is good for them because they make something out of nothing. He goes to school on everyone. He’s just doing everything and knows more than anyone. Don’t build an undifferentiated commodity product. Do what things other cannot. Create a market swarm your greatest opportunity. Sees the ai trend decades ahead positions for it and stays in the game long enough to get lucky but he went all in on ai. He sees people using for ai through a research paper that he sees on the edge that hacked the chip and got big improvements so he hires him develops Cuda and educates the market. He went all in and this lead to a 90% decline and everyone wants him to pivot but he believes and continues on the path. Educates the markets by giving their stuff away doing talks at universities and writing textbooks. He was crazy and just went all in. He was just lucky or very right likely both.

  And a friend of mine was just at this small intimate conference with Mitch recently. And he was blown away by how focused Mitch was. And the entire time, Mitch was sitting towards the front, listening to speakers, and he was taking pages and pages of notes. And my friend had this thought where he's like, I don't get this, Mitch. You're more successful than anybody else here. ([Time 1:20:13](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7e5dd218-a92c-4f42-9a08-3123bc6c9d32))
- **Nvidia's CUDA Education Strategy**
  * Nvidia proactively educated the market about GPU computing before it was widely adopted, recognizing the lack of existing resources. 
  * David Kirk, an Nvidia employee, delivered numerous talks and authored a textbook on the subject, which became a foundational resource translated into multiple languages. 
  * Nvidia hosted summits for researchers and engineers to discuss CUDA and GPU usage, gathering feedback to inform product development.
  * Jensen Huang's foresight led Nvidia to prioritize AI, recognizing its potential as a massive opportunity and driving the company's strategic focus towards it despite heavy resistance. 
  * Nvidia built a "strong self-reinforcing network", or moat, through strategic decisions. 
  * The company prioritized a general purpose GPU, introduced the easy-to-use CUDA programming layer, and listened to its CUDA users to grow the market and keep its lead.

  He would start educating students, professors, and department heads on all, on all the changes on how they were teaching computer science because parallel computing was going to Become far more important. David Kirk gave over a hundred talks over the course of a year on this. He winds up teaching a class himself at the University of Illinois on the subject. NVIDIA took it upon themselves to go over and spread the religion of GPU computing before it could, it really took off. In fact, this was a necessary step for it to take off. There was no textbook on this. So Kirk decides to write one. There's always like this book, this foundational book. It's hilarious. If you're trying to get a movement going, I think one step is to write a book on this. So Kirk writes the textbook on this. That textbook sells tens of thousands of copies, winds up getting translated into all these different languages, and it winds up being used by hundreds of schools to teach thousands, Maybe tens of thousands of students. Again, the idea is we need to educate the market. In addition to doing this at universities, they would host the business development and marketing people at NVIDIA would host summits. They'd have these two-day technology summits at NVIDIA where researchers and computer scientists and engineers could come and talk about like how they're using CUDA and the GPUs. And so dozens of researchers from life science industry, chemical engineers, biologists, pharmacologists, software developers would attend. And then Jensen would show up and he would sit down and get feedback with the real world users of CUDA and then use the insights that he learned from them to inform the development of the Product. And so again, this is where now we're in 2012, 2013, and Jensen just realizes, oh my God, this is going to want to be the biggest opportunities in history. We are going to, this opportunity of GPU powered deep learning is going to be massive and we need to go all in. And so let me read this part from the book for me. There was considerable debate within the executive team on this topic. Several of Jensen's key lieutenants were against investing more in deep learning in the belief that it was just a passing fad, but Jensen overruled them. Deep learning is going to be really big. He said, he said this in 2013, we are going all in on it. So if you think about it, everything that you and I have been talking about and highlighting and studying has led up to this. Jensen had built a company in the image of his own focused yet far-ranging mind. Now he would pull every lever at his disposal to navigate NVIDIA to the very center of the tech industry. As the company whose hardware could bring about the AI-powered future. It was definitely not a single day when the entire company changed forever. It was a period of several months where Jensen was increasingly interested and started asking increasingly deep questions and then started encouraging the company to swarm to machine Learning. Jensen announced a change in strategic focus in a company all-hands meeting. We need to consider this work as our highest priority. AI was going to be more important than anything else they could possibly be doing. Again, incredible, incredible insight and foresight, rather, on Jensen's part. He believed this was going to be the cause and now 10 years later, it's obviously true, obviously accurate. It was going to be the largest TAM expansion. Within a decade, Jensen was sure that AI would create the largest total addressable market expansion of software and hardware that we've seen in decades. And so the book does a great job of describing how the interplay of all these ideas, the decisions that Jensen and everybody in NVIDIA made over the course of three decades allowed them To build this very formidable moat. And I thought it was very fascinating. Jensen actually doesn't like the term moat. He prefers what he's really trying to build. And what he has built is a strong self-reinforcing network. And there's a great description of the strong self-reinforcing network, this moat that NVIDIA has built. It says, it's hard to describe NVIDIA's action as anything other than the construction of a competitive moat. NVIDIA made a general purpose GPU that represented the first major leap forward in computational acceleration since the invention of the CPU. The GPU's programmable layer, CUDA, was easy to use and opened up a wide range of functions across scientific, technical, and industrial sectors. As more people learned CUDA, the demand for GPUs increased. Jensen's strategic brilliance ensured that competitors would have difficulty breaking into a market that Nvidia had created. And I think the best way to close is a reminder that the most succinct definition of the Nvidia way is that it is Jensen's way, or it is simply Jensen himself.
