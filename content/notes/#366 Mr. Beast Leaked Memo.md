  Speaker 1
  So I thought it would be useful to try to brain dump as much as I can into this silly little book to give new people and to help bring them up to speed on everything we've learned over the past Decade with this channel. We've been through a lot and chances are most of the problems you face we've dealt with. So I genuinely believe that if you tentately read and understand the knowledge here, you'll be much better set up for success. So right from the very beginning, when he's like, hey, this stuff may be new to you, but we have a ton of experience and likely the problems that you're encountering are not novel. We can explain what you're likely to run into and how to solve them. So this was my exact experience when I talked to Sam Zell, when I had lunch with him, when I had dinner with Charlie Munger. They had entire historical databases of companies and industries and all these examples from 60 to 70 years of experience of building companies, of studying companies. By the time I met them, there's probably not a single novel problem that they have not seen in the past. There was a great line from last week's episode on Nick Sleep's partnership letters that talks about this. You know, him doing all this thinking, spending all this time trying to think through problems. He arrives at a conclusion and realized, wait, I'm buffing the figure this out 50 years ago. He says, as a young man, there's something slightly depressing about thinking things through for a while, arriving at a somewhat reasoned conclusion, only to find that others have Been there before you and years earlier. In some respects, we are 50 years behind Buffett. And I think these two lines that Jimmy wrote, we've been through a lot, and chances are most of the problems you face we've dealt with. So, I genuinely believe if you actually read and understand the knowledge here, you'll be much better set up for success. I think that's why you find in people that reach the top of the profession, they have this historical database they can draw in, draw from in their head. It's exactly why Sam Zell and Charlie Munger spent so much time reading and studying history. And so back to Jimmy says, this is not a rule book. I need to kick this thing off by saying the purpose of this is not to give you a bunch of rules to follow, what we do is complex, and change is based on the situation. I need you to repeat this in your head three times, I will apply everything I read with a grain of salt. This is not an inclusive list of everything. I hope this inspires you with questions and to come to us to learn more. I could make a separate book for creative, a separate book for production, a separate book for editors, etc. But I think that's dumb. Everything we do here is interconnected, and the more you understand about what others are doing and trying to accomplish, the better setup for success you will be. I advise everyone to read this in its entirety. A good example of this is James Warren. He understands every single part of this company at a deep level, and as a result, can make decisions faster than anyone else. The stuff you will be reading about he knows like the back of his hand. I've seen a team of five people work on a project for a week just to give up and James solve it in 30 minutes. That shows the power that comes when you understand everything in this book deeply. So I'll pause and interrupt myself there so that there's something that happens over and over again. My favorite line on this comes from Sam Zemuri from the book The Fish That Ate the Whale. He says, if you know your business from A to Z, there's no problem you can't solve. And in addition to that line from Sam Zemuri, I had a bunch of notes around just this one section on James Warren. This idea, you know, he understands every single part of the company at a deep level, and as a result can make decisions faster than anyone else. You can have a team of five that can fail to solve a problem over a week, and he solves it in 30 minutes. In Sam Zell's autobiography, he talks about one of the most important relationships that he ever made was with this extremely famous and wealthy family that's in Chicago. It's the Pritzker family. And Jay Pritzker, I think is close to 19 or 20 years older than Sam Zell, serves as almost like a friend and a mentor to him for a very long time and teaches him a lot. In fact, in the autobiography, Sam Zell writes that Jay Pritzker was the smartest financial guy he ever met. And so one of the things that Sam Zell said that he learned from Jay Pritzker that I've never forgotten, even though I read the book, you know, over two years ago, I think, is he says that Jay taught me to use simplicity as a strategy. He had an uncanny ability to grasp an extremely complex situation and immediately locate the weakness. He always said that if there were 12 steps in a deal, the whole thing depended on just one of them. The others would either work themselves out or were less important. And Sam said that Jay was able to identify the most important part extremely fast. It reminds me of what Buffett said about Munger, that he says, Charlie's got the best 30-second mind in the world. If I call him and describe a problem to him, any kind of a situation, he gets to the essence of it immediately. I think that's exactly what Jimmy is describing the talent that James has and the importance of knowing as much as you can and as deep as you can about every single aspect of your business. I think this goes back to what Nick Sleep wrote in his investment letters. One of his favorite quotes was that the art of being wise is the art of knowing what to overlook. You bring a deal to Jay Pritzker, you say, here's 10 important things. He's like, bullshit, there's the one important thing, solve that. And everything else falls in line. And so back to this, Jimmy ends this section with very important advice. ([Time 0:03:53](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c66fa5ff-a36d-4607-8875-31915c9ee3ff))
    - **Note:** Your problems aren’t new everyone in history has encountered similar problems. This is why we study history. Building a complex system. Know your business from a-z use simplicity as a strategy. Find the leverage point and exploit it. The guy who knows so much solved a problem in 30 mins that it took 5 people a week to not solve. Find the most important point and forget the other things that don’t matter. Have a clear goal and live up to that. Don’t do 5 things but one thing very well. Wants a players critical mass of smart people. As hire as b hire cs. Don’t do anything someone else can do. The great ones have a deep historical knowledge the greats know more. Tarintino knows more about movies than anyone. Steve jobbs knows about the valley than anyone. You can’t teach this obsession it’s natural.
- Effort and Ownership Drive Success
  Summary:
  Effort, accountability, and ownership are crucial for success in tasks and projects, emphasizing that the job is not just about delegating but also about ensuring completion.
  Individuals must proactively engage with team members, recognizing and addressing bottlenecks to avoid project failures. Establishing clear communication about responsibilities and deadlines is essential.
  Embracing bad news rather than avoiding it fosters a culture of transparency, allowing for more effective problem-solving.
  Critical thinking and verification are necessary to prevent potential issues, and cultivating a mindset of accountability ensures that each team member understands their role in achieving results.
  The combination of creativity, effort, accountability, and ownership, though rare, is vital for sustained success in collaborative endeavors.

  Were alive he'd go build relationships with them. But he would also study the great work from the past. He could tell you how the work he was doing on the Macintosh related to Alexander Graham Bell's work on the telephone. And I want to bring that up as we go into the next section, because I think a lot of what Jimmy's writing about, it's like, this is effort. This is caring. This is passion. I don't know if you can teach this. My personal viewpoint on this is what Jeff Faisal said. People don't have ideas, ideas have people. So he continues, On top of learning from watching YouTube, I'd love you to read the book The Goal. I used to make everyone read it. I know bottlenecks may seem obvious, but just not knowing and understanding something as simple as bottlenecks has fucked tons of videos. And so he gives some examples of mistakes made in the past and how to avoid them. Let's say you're in production and a video you're assigned to is put up 45 days out. A lot of things need to happen before you can start working on it. The big things would probably be a thumbnail sketch and creative on your team to write the video. Do not just go to them and say, I need creative. Let me know when it's done. And I need a thumbnail. Let me know when it's done. This is what most people do. And it's one of the reasons why we fail so much. I want you to look them in the eye and tell them that they are the bottleneck and take it a step further and explain why they are the bottleneck so you both are on the same page. Tyler, you are my bottleneck. I have 45 days to make this video happen and I cannot begin to work on it until I know what the contents of the video is. I need you to confirm you understand this is important and we need to set a date on when the creative will be done. Let's say Tyler and you agree that it will be done in 5 days. You don't get to set a reminder for 5 days and not talk to him for 5 days. Every single day you must check in on Tyler and make sure he is still on track to hit the target date. I want less excuses in this company. Take ownership and don't give your project a chance to fail. I want you to have a mindset that God himself couldn't stop you from making this video on time." And so again, I think this section, this is not, you don't have to be a genius. This is effort. This is caring about what you're doing. When he gets to the point, he's like, I want less excuses in the company because I just reread my past highlights from that book, The Billionaire and the Mechanic, which is about Larry Ellison. It made me think of Larry Ellison again. Let me read this excerpt from the book. Larry was teaching the sailing master about other kinds of high stakes decision making. Larry had told Russell a story of when he was working with the Israeli Defense Forces, reviewing the progress on one of their new Oracle systems. The Israeli General began the meeting by studying Larry and asking him, What did you bring me today? Results or excuses? And so there'll be several times in the memo where Jimmy repeats, you know, the idea was like, we're all working together. If you ask somebody to do something, you don't follow up, and then they don't do it, you can't just say, Oh, I did my job. No, the job is the result. The job is not asking it to be done. The job is getting it done. And then Jimmy just continues. He says, hey, I just want to brain dump about a bunch of random things and explain why we do or why we say certain things. These are cheat codes and you should take them to heart. So one of them that he says is say the negatives. Do not just tell people on your team or me why something is good. It is infinitely more valuable to tell us why it's not good. And what you could say here is really just tell us the bad news because the good news takes care of itself. This is what Charlie Munger calls the Persian messenger syndrome. And in Poor Charlie's Almanac, Charlie says ancient Persians actually killed some messengers whose sole fault was that they brought home truthful bad news of like a battle loss, for Example. It was actually safer for the messenger to run away and hide instead of doing his job as a wiser boss would have wanted it done. The proper anecdote to creating Persian messenger syndrome is exactly what Jimmy's doing here. And its bad effects is to develop, through exercise of will, a habit of welcoming bad news. At Berkshire, there is a common injunction. Always tell us the bad news promptly. It's only the good news that can wait. Another section I want to talk to you about. Don't take anything at face value. Always dig. One of the common themes you're probably seeing is accountability, and this doubles down on that. Don't take anything at face value, always dig. If someone says something's too good to be true, find out why. If you need 10,000 pillows by next week, and you've called 10 pillow companies, and none of them have more than a few hundred in stock, but the 11th company magically has 10,000 pillows, Investigate. Are the pillows shitty? Why the fuck does no one want your pillows? Push and get answers. What tends to happen is people think their job is done by finding 10,000 pillows and just order them only for us to find problems when they arrive. But then it's too close to the filming window to fix it. Do not overly trust people outside the company. Verify what they say. It is your fault if they don't pull through. So I'm on page 16 when you print this thing out. I think it's 36 pages in length. And what I would say is the summary so far is just a handful of things that all work well together. It's ownership, it's accountability, it's creativity, and it's effort. And you've probably had a very similar experience with Jimmy's had. The fact that when you're working with other people, it's remarkable how rare the combination of those four traits are in a single individual and that a single individual can apply Those four traits consistently over a long period of time. And so then Jimmy goes into how does he want people in the company to communicate. ([Time 0:21:00](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1aab43e3-ff79-43f7-8c7a-589c110242b4))
    - **Note:** Take agency and ownership. Bring results vs excuses. Bring the negatives the good news takes care of itself. Don’t take anything at face value always dig. Trust but verify. Ownership accountability creativity and effort is the key.
- Elevate Communication, Embrace Mistakes
  Summary:
  Effective communication is crucial in a professional setting, with a preference for higher forms of communication such as face-to-face interactions over emails to reduce miscommunication risks.
  The complexity of the message dictates the communication method, and it's essential to confirm receipt of written communications. Mistakes should be embraced as opportunities for growth rather than reasons for punitive measures.
  Learning from failures is seen as an investment in personal development, and taking risks is crucial for innovation.
  Using consultants is highly encouraged as they can expedite learning and efficiency in tasks by drawing on their expertise.
  Additionally, resilience in the face of rejection is essential; 'Pushing Through No' involves exploring all possible avenues and not accepting a single rejection as the final answer.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Jimmy goes into how does he want people in the company to communicate. And he calls this a higher form of communication. If you spend any amount of time with James, you'll hear him bring up higher forms of communication a lot, because it's important and somehow very overlooked by most people. The worst thing you could ever do when you need something for your critical component is email someone at the company. The best is to talk to them in real life. It's very important you know when to call people for stuff, grab them in real life, and when to text them. The lower the form of communication, the more miscommunication you will face. As I'm typing this to you, you have no idea if I'm laughing, smiling, happy, mad or sad. You can't read my body language or my face, and because of that, it's not guaranteed that you'll understand what I'm conveying. One week out from a video and the thing you're working on just went south? Minimum. A multi-way call with the heads of that video. Ideally, you grab them in real life. The more complex what needs to be said is, the higher the form of communication you should use. Call first, then text if they don't answer. Since we're on the topic of communication, written communication also does not constitute communication unless they confirm they read it. And then the next section goes back to the importance of ownership. Own your mistakes. I hate excuses, and I despise with my entire soul when people just try to save face instead of learn from how they messed up. Mistakes are okay. Genuinely, they are, and I expect you to make a lot. That is perfectly fine. Every veteran here has cost me a million dollars at one point or another and you can go ask them yourself if I ever held it over their heads. The reason I'm okay with your fuck ups is because I know that's how you learn. I see it as me investing in you and your brain. Hence, while I have zero tolerance for C players and they must go immediately, those fuck ups could be done by an A player that will retain the information learned. I just beg you that you learn from every mistake and try not to repeat it." That's a really important point that he makes. Mistakes are okay. Genuinely they are. I expect you to make a lot. There's this great line in this book called The Unpublished David Ogilvie, is this collection of internal memos that David wrote over like half a century as he was building his company. And he's warning his companies, like, as we get bigger and more successful, we stop taking risks. We stop being entrepreneurs. And so he tells a great story about the importance of this. He says, are we freewheeling entrepreneurs ready to take risk in new ventures? Or are we too frightened of making mistakes? When the toy buyer at Sears made a mistake which cost his company 10 million bucks, I asked the head of Sears, are you going to fire him? He replied, hell no. I fire people who don't make mistakes. That's a similar line of thinking that Bezos says. I think he said it in his share of letters he might have said in an interview. But if you're not making any mistakes, you're not taking enough risk. And Bezos even takes it a step further. He's like, well, the bigger the company gets, the more expensive, expensive the mistakes should be because we're getting bigger as a company. And so this next part went viral on Twitter and was sent to me by a bunch of people. It says, use consultants. Consultants are literally cheat codes. Need to make the world's largest slice of cake? Start by calling the person who made the previous world's largest slice of cake. He's already done countless tests and can save you weeks, save you weeks worth of work. I really want to drill this point home because I'm a massive believer in consultants. Because I've spent almost a decade of my life hyper obsessing over YouTube, I can show a brand new creator how to go from 100 subscribers to 10,000 in a month. On their own, it would take them years to do it. Consultants are a gift from God. Please take advantage of them. In every single freaking task assigned to you, always, always, always ask yourself first if you can find a consultant to help you. This is so important that I am demanding you repeat this three times in your head. I will always check for consultants when I'm assigned a task." And then this next piece of advice really has to do with finding high agency, really working with high agency people. And so he says, when dealing with people outside Mr. Beach Productions, never take no at face value. If we need a store to buy everything inside of and you call the local dollar tree and the person that answers says, no, you can't film here, that literally doesn't mean shit. Talk to other employees and see if they are or if any of the other employees are fans, or if they have kids that are fans of the channel. Try talking to their boss. Talk to their bosses boss. Have me DM them on Twitter and try their social team. If after all avenues are exhausted and you're left with a no that doesn't mean don't try the other Dollar Trees because the manager of those could be huge fans and willing to bend the rules. This is what we call Pushing Through No. Do not just stop because one person told you no. Stop when all conceivable options are exhausted. Want to see what a high agency person looks like. ([Time 0:26:15](https://share.snipd.com/snip/15ce2c30-ada4-4dda-8979-dca7a44b6d54))
    - **Note:** Comunication and firing people who don’t make mistakes. Use the right consultants. High agency people don’t just take the first no. Be honest vs nice. He lives with constant improvement obsessed with details. Overpay for talent. Apple acquired next for 500mm just to get Steve jobbs and it made them trillions. Talent is always underpriced.
- Seek Truth Over Approval
  Summary:
  Valuable insights emerge from the critique of creative work, emphasizing that the pursuit of approval can cloud judgment.
  Being overly concerned with how others perceive one's contributions can distract from the primary focus on the quality of the work itself. The lesson highlights the importance of prioritizing the integrity of the work over personal validation, encouraging individuals to embrace constructive criticism and remain dedicated to excellence rather than seeking external affirmation.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  At the end of the video, he says something that's very fascinating. And he tells the story when Steve called him vain. And it's interesting to note, this is one of the top three lessons he ever learned from Steve Jobs. This is what the one of the three answers he gave to that question, what are the three lessons you learned most from him. So this is what Johnny said. I remember asking Steve about this. I said it could be perceived that his critique of a piece of work was a little harsh and that we've been putting our heart and soul into this and I asked him could we not moderate the things We said a little and he said why and I said because I care about the team and Steve said this brutally brilliant insightful thing. He said no no, Johnny, you're just really vain. You just want people to like you. I'm surprised at you. I thought you held the work up as the most important, not how you believed you were being perceived by other people. And Johnny said, and I was terribly cross because I knew he was right. ([Time 0:33:24](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a6be3978-3564-43bf-9a04-847f3e2af02e))
    - **Note:** True definition of vanity.
- Invest in Talent, Not Formalities
  Summary:
  Overcompensating top talent is essential, as exceptional individuals provide disproportionate value to a business.
  Hiring the best can prevent significant losses, making financial prudence in talent acquisition paramount. Recognizing the dynamic range of abilities in humans is critical; even slightly less qualified candidates can cost much more in lost opportunities.
  Leadership can be cultivated through clear communication of intentions and a willingness to learn.
  A culture of consistent feedback and continuous improvement is more effective than formal performance reviews, which can be counterproductive.
  Individuals should proactively seek constructive criticism to enhance their skills and fulfill their potential within the organization.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  He's like, I really don't care to hoard a bunch of money. I deeply believe in rewarding the people that help this business get to where it needs to be. And so in the episode on how to make a few billion dollars, it says, and what do you do with A players? You overpay the hell out of them because here's the thing. The reason you should overpay them is because it's nearly impossible to overpay for talent, meaning somebody is the best in the world at what they do. Think about Steve Jobs. What Steve Jobs said earlier, in some fields, the best person is not twice as good. There are a hundred times as good. Think about when Steve Jobs was coming back to Apple. Apple bought Next for almost half a billion dollars. The way to think about that is Apple paid a half a billion dollars to rehire Steve Jobs and they got the deal of a century. And so Brad Jacob says, it makes no financial sense to skimp on a salary and incentives to save $100,000 a year when hiring the second best candidate may cost you millions of dollars in Lost profit. Another way to summarize that is never, ever forget the dynamic range of humans. So he goes back to this. We need more leaders in the company. We need hardworking, obsessive, coachable, intelligent grinders that can step up and lead. If you want to become a production manager, tell James your intention and ask him why you suck and how you can become better. Seriously. He will give you a list of things that you need to improve on to become what we need. If you actually listen and master those things, we will give you a shot at the role. I think the best biography of Steve Jobs ever written was becoming Steve Jobs. And in that book, it said Steve didn't give his team much formal feedback during the U.S. Versus Microsoft antitrust case. Microsoft subpoenaed all my personnel records at Apple. So I'm sitting down with our lawyer and he says, I've gotten your file from HR. He pulls it out and there's only one piece of paper in it, something meaningless. And he's like, where is your file? Where's your annual reviews and all that? I told him that I'd never had an annual review. Steve didn't believe in reviews. He disliked all that formality. His feeling was I give you feedback all the time. What do you need a review for? And so back to this, just go and ask like, what do you want? ([Time 0:41:06](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e2ecf06e-7928-459e-a89f-72c446bcbc4f))
    - **Note:** You can’t overpay for talent.
