- Empower Through Constraints, Not Permissions
  Summary:
  Organizations can adopt either a permission culture, where individuals must seek approval before acting, or a constraint culture, where individuals are free to act unless explicitly prohibited.
  In a permission culture, people are often paralyzed by the need for consent, leading to a lack of initiative and an environment where accountability is diminished, as illustrated by the reluctance to take on tasks outside defined roles. Conversely, a constraint culture fosters empowerment by establishing clear boundaries within which individuals can operate autonomously.
  This enables greater innovation and creativity, as people are encouraged to use their judgment and work within the parameters set by the organization’s goals and policies.
  For example, a constraint culture can set financial thresholds for spending, granting individuals the freedom to make decisions that drive the business forward without unnecessary delays.
  Ultimately, the choice between these cultures significantly influences decision-making processes and shapes the organization’s potential for growth and adaptability.

  Speaker 1
  You can have a permission culture or a constraint culture. So a permission culture is a culture where you guessed it, you have to ask permission to do anything. So the default assumption is you can't do anything until you're told that you can. So the bathroom pass that you had in school, perfect example of a permission culture, you can't even go to the bathroom without asking. That's how badly we're going to drill that into your head. And so that way you understand that that's how the world works. And there are so many examples of this in the form of instructions and protocols and guidelines and manuals and all that. And permission can come in many forms. It can come in the form of like a promotion. Like now you're the head of marketing. So now you get to make choices about what we invest our money in, but that's still a form of permission. It's still me giving you this position that I have gained to put you in. And permission cultures tend to have a problem, which is that they then have to define everything because to your point earlier about judgment, there's no room for judgment in a permission Culture unless you have the permission already. So you get a lot of people sitting on their hands. And these are the sorts of cultures where a leader will walk into the room and the trash hasn't been taken out and people will say, not my job. It's not my job to take the trash out. It's her job to take the trash out. So I'm not going to do it because I only do what I'm told. So that's one option. The other option is the culture of constraint, which is the absolute inverse. So you can do anything unless we say that you can't. So now our job with our agreements and our policies and our processes and our roles and our team structures is to clarify what the edges are to actually constrain the system in some way, Shape, or form. So when we create a purpose statement for the organization in a constraint culture, we're actually constraining directionality. We're saying like the vector of this company is towards we're going to be, you know, we're going to get the world on electric cars. So that I've descoped the rest of the stuff that we could do. We're not going to make mops. We're going to make electric cars. I sort of focused our energy and a hiring process is a constraint where I say instead of doing all the possible ways of hiring, we're going to hire this way. A, you know, a policy about harassment, anti-harassment policy is a constraint. It's basically saying don't do this. So I've eliminated this option from the surface area of all possible options. What's cool about building a constraint-based culture is when you eliminate all those risk surfaces that are what we call not safe to try or like fatal, what's left is all this space, All this space to think. So if I say it's not mops and it's not cars, you get everything else. And so the room for people to innovate and use judgment and use creativity and solving problems is just massively higher. And they get to navigate that. Now they're not used to that. So for an example, like we have a constraint in our system that if you spend more than $10,000 on something, you should probably seek advice first. But anything under that, it's like, you know, use your human judgment. We trust you, do what's best for the business, right? Spend the money like it was your own. So somebody engaging with that who's coming from a permission culture is like, I need a new computer. What can I spend? And they freak out and they literally freak out and they start like trying to talk to other people and like, can I get the MacBook Pro? Can I get the extra RAM? Like, what should I do? Give me permission. And the system is like, no, there's no permission for that. You already have permission to do that. You only need to seek advice if you're over a limit. You just need to use your own judgment. And it's this first moment often in many people's careers where they're like, holy shit, I'm 100% trusted. And I don't even know how to operate in this judgment space of like, how much should I spend? So they didn't really answer your question yet, but that's the bedrock of the answer to your question is once we know which of those lanes we're in, permission or constraint, then we Know how to approach decision making for the next layer of the cake. And that starts to set up the possibilities. Keep going. ([Time 0:51:54](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0430b824-7266-4be5-b666-797f284e88e5))
    - **Note:** Permission vs constrained culture. It’s viral to empower people and create even balance of talking. Create better systems around conversation so not just one person but everyone is speaking and contributing. Need to create rules that invite thought to be expressed and silence from others so people can speak. Create constraints and permissions but allow everything otherwise.
- Embrace Freedom in Decision Making
  Summary:
  People often hesitate to make decisions due to an over-reliance on organizational structures, fearing that they lack the freedom to act.
  It is essential to recognize that individuals have the agency to make choices and must be willing to face the consequences. Furthermore, there is often confusion between type one (irreversible) and type two (reversible) decisions, leading to unnecessary anxiety about the permanence of their choices.
  Adopting an iterative mindset is crucial, as most decisions are not final and can be adjusted.
  Lastly, there is a lack of understanding in decision science, where many miss the opportunity to analyze and build a well-structured proposal for decision-making, which should include context, risks, assumptions, and alternatives.
  Practicing this structured approach can significantly enhance decision quality and accountability.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  So if we get out of the org structure or the operating system and go down to the individual level, where is it that you see people make mistakes in decision making at that sort of micro level That are correctable or predictable?
  Speaker 1
  Well, I think the first place that we make mistakes is perhaps not understanding our own freedom. So in systems like that, what tends to happen is people are hesitant to make a decision because it doesn't feel like I should be able to. So there's a lot of blaming the system and a lot of looking for guidance and permission and all that kind of stuff that still exists. When it's like, you can just go do what you need to do. You can go, you can go play and you can deal with the consequences. So that's one piece of the puzzle. The other piece is that we're not great at telling the difference between type one and type two decisions, the kind of one way door, two way door metaphor that people use, just on balance. Folks struggle a little bit with like, how would I roll this back versus how is that something I can't roll back? We'd like to believe that every decision we make is like the end of the world. And it just really is not. You know, even things that feel really final are just not final. And so I think getting into that iterative mindset around decision making is important. And then the last thing is we just don't have a lot of practice or experience with decision science. And so we haven't spent a lot of time learning what makes a good decision or a bad decision, how to think about building context, how to think about risks and assumptions and alternatives. And so really building the proposal for a decision in the right anatomy, like we have the context or the tension that's driving this, the recommendation, the risks, the assumptions, The alternatives, the ways to know if this worked. That structure is not intuitive for most folks. And so when they make a decision, they just make it, they're just like, mmm, blue. And then, and then we make the decision and then we never go back. And in fact, when I was studying some of the biggest decisions we make in companies, I did a big analysis on M&A for the book. We don't even look back on that stuff very often.

    - **Note:** Most decisions we think are one way doors are 2 way doors. How an organization makes decisions
- Embrace the Power of Reflection
  Summary:
  Retrospectives serve as valuable opportunities for learning, akin to the rewarding feeling experienced after exercising.
  Despite initial resistance to participating, individuals often leave feeling energized and satisfied, recognizing the importance of these sessions. For a retrospective to be effective, a culture of open communication and feedback must be established beforehand, which alleviates tension and prepares participants for constructive collaboration.
  During the session, engaging questions and structured dialogue are crucial for fostering meaningful conversations, and it's essential to encourage a lively exchange of ideas.
  After the retrospective, the challenge lies in effectively implementing insights gained; without a clear strategy to operationalize outcomes, valuable suggestions risk being overlooked.
  Creating agreements that naturally integrate changes into team governance helps ensure that insights translate into actionable shifts, enhancing team dynamics and overall effectiveness.

  The retrospective is so interesting because it's like free learning, just hanging there, but nobody wants to take it. Yeah.
  Speaker 1
  It's like, it's a lot like exercise, honestly. Like most people that I know, there are exceptions that I'm very jealous of, but most people that I know are like, I kind of don't want to go in when I get to the gym. Like I'm not, I'm not like pumped to go work out. But when they finish, they feel great. Like they walk out and they're like high on life, you know, I'm walking on sunshine. Like they're so proud. They feel good. They've got those endorphins running. Same thing is true of retrospectives having facilitated, I don't know God, ungodly amounts of them. Um, everybody coming in is like, we could be doing real work right now. And instead you're making us do this. And then coming out everybody's like, why don't we do that more often? Why don't we do that more often? And what I find is wild is that that pattern persists long after people know better. Like even after you've done a dozen retrospectives monthly, you still go in like, do we really need this today? Do we really need this today? And then you walk out going like, yep, we really needed it today. And I don't know how long it takes back to sink in.
  Speaker 2
  What have you learned from doing so many retrospectives? Like what makes for a good retrospective versus a poor one?
  Speaker 1
  What should companies track at the moment they're making a decision to make it easier to look back and do a good retrospective? I think there's probably three things about retrospectives that are interesting. It's the before, during and after aspect of it. So the before aspect is if you don't have a culture of communication and authentic communication, what Jim would talk about, right? Like really Jim Deathmer talking about like being conscious and authentic and being in that kind of connection. If you don't have that, then you can show up to the to the retro and everybody's clenched, everybody's tight because we haven't we have no information, essentially, about how we did. And so we're just waiting to see like what what negative or fearful or challenging or threatening things might come up. But if you have a culture of fleet of feedback and constant flow, if you have, we do my co-host Rodney talks about him as hot washes, like a hot wash after every engagement, every major Milestone, you sort of say like, Hey, what, what do we notice? What stood out? What would we do differently next time? Just micro retros. Then when you get to the big one, it's kind of like a little bit of the air's out of the balloon and you have a little sense of like where your colleagues heads are at and where you're at. So now it's safe. And now it's like, all right, let's actually make sense of this thing. So that's the that's sort of the before aspect is coming in with a little bit of flow already happening, not clenched. The middle part is about having the right questions and the right structure. So it's really easy to have a retro that is boring and stale and asks a question that doesn't provoke. And ideally you want to have a retro that that really challenges you. And so a friend of ours, actually, a former colleague and mine started a company called Parable and they and they have software that does this, but the prompts are really, really good. And that helps to make the conversation more profound. And in fact, the answers people give when they first feed the beast of like noticing and observations, that's sort of important. But it's actually the conversation that happens as you start to group them and talk about them and theme them and figure out what went on. That's most important. So it's the it's the group sense making that matters most. So if I don't see conversation happening when I'm facilitating a retro, that's my first clue that we're not doing the right stuff. And so I'll try to figure out why is the conversation not happening. Is it not? And it's bubbliness. It's burstiness, I think is what Adam Grant would call it. Like you want burstiness in the conversation where people are talking over each other. They're so excited to share what they're noticing about that particular issue or area. If you don't see that, then you may have to change the question or you may have to change the participants or have some people step forward and step back or put on music or who knows what, Right? But you got to do something. And then the last bit, which is the one I'm most obsessed with with what we're building and thinking about is what do you do with the insights? And that's where most teams really fall down. So they have good inputs, they have good sorting, they have good conversations, and they really come up with some cool ideas. Like we need to change the way we do this process. We need to change the way we pair program. We need to think about this customer issue that we didn't think about this time. And then it kind of goes to die. Like it kind of just it goes on the cutting room floor because we don't have a way of operationalizing that stuff. And that's where it can be really, really cool to have a culture of agreements already in place is that you know what to do with it. You're like, oh, this feels like an agreement that we need to make or this feels like we need to change an agreement we already have. And so it moves into the governance space instead of the like to do list space. And you actually change the fabric of the company as a result or the fabric of the team as a result of that retro in two or three small ways. And then you've got your juice for the squeeze. And then if other things change too, because individuals take action, that's great. Like we always want to hope for that. But if I don't get two or three agreement shifts out of a retro, I'm really disappointed. ([Time 1:06:59](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c3f36df3-858a-4fc4-9177-1d789ae5297e))
    - **Note:** Do retrospectives and have a culture of clear and honest communication. Have a culture of feedback and constant flow to get information from past experiences. Having good prompts and grouping the conversation is vital. You need a flowing bursting conversation. What do you do with the insights you need to operationalize stuff through making agreements. You need to make agreement shifts after a retro.
- Cultivate Change Through Collective Action
  Summary:
  Identifying barriers to optimal performance within the team encourages open exploration of possibilities.
  Individual contributors have crucial choices to make regarding their work environment and whether leaders are receptive to new ideas. A shift in interview focus from financial incentives to organizational culture reflects a desire for an environment that fosters innovation rather than constraints.
  Sharing successful examples from various companies can ignite interest and engagement, creating a 'spark' that fosters collaboration.
  Even a small percentage of the organization, as little as 5%, can instigate significant cultural change.
  Real-world evidence reveals that transformational change often requires gradual, sustained efforts rather than abrupt shifts, and notable progress can occur within specific functions over time.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  What's stopping your team from doing its best work? And then they say and you're like, well, we did experiment around this. You should try and experiment around that. So you sort of open up the aperture. If you're an individual player, if you're like an IC, I think you have some choices to make really important choices. One of them is to decide if you think the people in power around you are going to be open to any of this or not. And if they're not, then I think you have career choices to make, assuming that you have the privilege to to make career choices. And often people will jump. They will think about like, where can I actually bring these ideas to life in a more meaningful way? And it changes the way they interview. You know, they used to interview for just like, what are the stock options going to be worth? And now they start to interview for like, is this a culture of permission or constraint? You know, they like changed the orientation of their of their approach. So that's a piece of the puzzle. And also you can engage people in conversation and you can be a thought sharer in a system like that in a way that's really, um, that's really quite useful. So just sharing examples of companies where you're like, Hey, look what Patagonia did, look what higher did, look what buffer did, look what Bridgewater did, look what Burning Man Does, look what Mondragon does, look what WL Gore does or Pixar, Netflix or Morningstar, Bert's, it means just like you go down and down and down the list and people start to see a pattern. And then maybe you find a leader, maybe it's yours, maybe it's someone else's who's like, I kind of see the same stuff. Like I'm kind of interested in the same stuff. I'm a rebel too. And that's, that's where you start. That's the spark. So you kind of have to start by sharing and see if there's any pull at all. And if there's no pull, then then maybe look at greener pastures. And if there's any pull at all, you, that's, that's the spark. And one can become two and two can become 10. And we have found that you actually need a surprisingly small percentage of the organization to get hip to this stuff for it to really start to turn. Um, it's not, it's not even 20%. Like 5% can be enough to really. Change the story.
  Speaker 2
  Have you seen examples of that where it's like 5% and they've sort of changed the or culture from the bottom up and it's been sustainable? Yeah.
  Speaker 1
  I mean, I think you see, you see a combination of things. Number one, you see what's possible when the leader gets on board, which is hard enough, like, you know, the example of like the transformation at higher in, in China, um, is a super profound One because it was a traditional system and it became non-traditional. And that was, that was wild and super hard at that scale. 60,000 people. Um, but by the same token, you see little changes every day in the companies that we work with. So I mean, we work with everybody from the CDC to the Fed, to Lockheed Martin, to Boeing, to GE in the past, et cetera. And you know, you, you never see the whole system change on a dime. Of course it's never, you never stand back two years later and you're like, wow, a hundred thousand people work differently. But what you do see our entire functions change. So as an example, we worked with a company called Bloomin brands. ([Time 1:13:30](https://share.snipd.com/snip/224517ef-9b0e-4def-ae7d-e7a54da9b609))
    - **Note:** You can change the or culture from the bottom up or at least try but if you can’t, then you need to leave an interview for jobs that enable agency. System change can happen but it takes time.
