  Speaker 1
  Given that an additional person would probably cost at least that amount over their lifetime, factoring in raises, benefits, and other expenses down to the amount, the fact that the Company would have to buy more toilet paper. This is how insane this guy paid attention to cost and efficiency. And unless the company fell on very hard times, the employee added would be unlikely to be dismissed. However, marginal his contribution to the business. So as we go through this overview of Tom Murphy's life and his business philosophy, just remember that, he watched headcount like a hawk. So let's go back to the book, the chapter on Tom Murphy in The Outsiders. And it's going to pick up where we just left off where capital cities winds up vastly outperforming over the three decades CBS and like, okay, well, how does this happen? How did this seemingly insurmountable gap between these two companies get closed? So it says the answer lies in fundamentally different management approaches CBS spend much of the 1960s and 1970s, taking the enormous cash flows generated by its network and broadcast Operations and funding an aggressive acquisition program that led it into entirely new fields. So instead of focusing on other media properties, media business that they knew well, they bought things like a toy business and they even bought the New York Yankees. They also would issue stock to fund some of these acquisitions. They're going to compare and contrast obviously the way CBS is being led under this guy named Bill Paley, who's actually the founder of CBS.

    - **Note:** Capital cities is worth 16x less than cbs and is eventually sold for 3x more. CBS focused on other media properties and angles filled capital cities was ruthlessly efficient and kept the main thing the main thing. Find your edge don’t diversify and repeat what works. This was the age of conglomerates and diversification lavish offices and nonsense. Tom kept the main thing the main thing wanted to be on the train that got there first with the least fuel not the longest train. When Tom was buying tv networks cbs bought the Yankees. He was a master capital allocator using debt when needed paying that down buying back stock whatever was the best use of capital. Murphy was successful because he didn’t mindlessly copy peers nor did he go too fast and get overlevered and die but moved at the best pace where he could integrate acquisitions without getting over his skis developing operational excellence to eventually buy abc.

  And he talks a little bit about why this happened to them and why it did not happen to Tom Murphy. A lot of these companies collapsed under the burden of too much debt. These companies typically failed because they acquired too rapidly and underestimated the difficulty of integrating acquisitions and improving operations. Murphy's approach to the roll up was different. He moved slowly. He developed real operational expertise, which I think is one of the benefits of not diversifying, right? By the time he does his biggest acquisition, he's going to come three decades into his career. He's going to buy ABC with Warren Buffett's help. He can have real conviction. Do do I actually have operational expertise in operating all these media properties? Well, let me look at the past 30 years. Did I do this correctly or not? And then he focused on a small number of large acquisitions that he knew to be high probability bets. Capital cities combined excellence in both operations and capital allocation to an unusual degree. And that goes back to the start of the chapter where Buffett saying Murphy and Burke are probably the greatest two-person combination ever. And it's this division of labor, the fact that Burke was the incredible operator, the one that rooted out all the inefficiencies. And then Murphy was the one that was a capital allocator focused on strategy and acquisitions, which we'll get to. And again, here's another great, uh, Merpheism, if you will. So he says capital cities combined excellence in both operations and capital allocation to an unusual degree. ([Time 0:11:40](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d8a9f557-9376-497a-8ca4-353febeb4942))
    - **Note:** Master capital allocation mixed with operational excellence. Business is a lot of small decisions every day mixed with a few big decisions. Tom isn’t afraid to be extremely bold when he finds something he believes in he commits to the path. He leaves his job in nyc to turn around a bankrupt Albany tv station takes him 3 years does this by aggressively managing cost. Create a decentralized philosophy and becomes a successful cable roll up. The company had Burke and Tom clear division of labor one was operations the other capital allocation. There is a limit to how many broadcast channels a company could own capital cities doesn’t stop but they go into news papers and eventually cable channels which was the future only Ted turner really saw it at the time it wasn’t very fashionable. But the genie was out of the bottle so it was a threat he made an opportunity

  Speaker 1
  And then it goes into another strategy that he used that was quite different. During the extended bear market of the mid 1970s to early 1980s, Murphy became an aggressive purchaser of his own shares. He eventually bought close, bought back close to 50% of his outstanding shares, most of it at single digit price to earnings multiples. In 1984, the FCC relaxed its station ownership rules and Murphy and his master stroke bought the ABC network. So the note I left myself here is this is something that comes up over and over again in these books, staying the game long enough to get lucky. This is the most important thing that he does in his entire business career. And it happens 30 years into his career. So he buys ABC network for nearly $3.5 billion with financing from his friend Warren Buffett. The ABC deal was the largest non oil and gas transaction in business history to that point. And an enormous bet. This is what I meant about him being able to be bold when he has real convection and an enormous bet the company transaction for Murphy representing over 100% of capital equities enterprise Value at the time. So the the Wall Street Journal reported on this transaction with the headline, the minnow swallows the whale. And then Murphy's partner Burke said at the time that this is the acquisition that have been training for my entire life. ([Time 0:19:06](https://share.snipd.com/snip/920cb315-5d35-4d3e-969a-4fb955b1ec52))
    - **Note:** They did a bet the company transaction to acquire abc which was bigger than capital cities with funding from buffet. The regulations lifted to make it possible and he took advantage stay in the game long enough to get lucky. They nearly double the margins of abc in 2 years there was a culture of excess vs efficiency clash. Limo culture vs cab man. Completely changed the culture. He 204x the company he created. He gave people the agency and autonomy to do what they wanted extremely decentralized structure extreme agency. High trust and extremely/ forever cost conscious. Obsessed with every spending line was scrutinized. They knew there was a power law in advertising so they weren’t cheap but expanded aggressively just did it responsibly. Gave responsibility to young managers and gave them so much autonomy that few ever left.

  Speaker 1
  Once he summarizes his approach as this, we take the assets and once we've paid them off, we leverage them again to buy other assets. Acquisitions was where Murphy spent the majority of his time. He did not delegate acquisition decisions and never used investment bankers to Murphy as a capital allocator. The company's extreme decentralization had important benefits and it allowed the company to operate more profitably than its peers, which in turn gave the company an advantage in Acquisitions by allowing Murphy to buy properties and know that under Burke, remember Burke's is extreme efficient operator, they would quickly be made more profitable lowering The effective price paid. When he had conviction, Murphy was prepared to act aggressively and Murphy was not impatient. Murphy was willing to wait a long time for attractive acquisitions. He once said, I get paid not just to make deals, but to make good deals. When he saw something he liked, Murphy was prepared to make a very large bet. Much of the value created during his nearly 30 year tenure CEO was the result of a handful of large acquisition decisions, just a handful. These acquisitions each represented 25% or more of the company's market cap at the time they were made. Murphy was a master at prospecting for deals. He knew what he wanted to buy and he would spend years developing relationships with the owners of these desirable properties. ([Time 0:31:29](https://share.snipd.com/snip/55025190-e99d-4aff-8bde-68d0c5dd296d))
    - **Note:** Murphy was extremely focused on differentiated capital allocation and knew through their operational excellence he could make them all accretive. He would never overpay never use bankers and would cultivate relationships over years before closing a deal. He would ask the price give his high counter and if it was too high he’d walk away. He made most of his money off a few small large acquisitions very disciplined. Easy to interface with. Focused on the main thing and compounded like hell. Bought back stock.
