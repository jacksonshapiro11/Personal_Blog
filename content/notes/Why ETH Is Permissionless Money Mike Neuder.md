### Highlights

- Recognize the Limits of Permissioned Currency
  Summary:
  USDC and USDT, despite being programmable, are fundamentally permissioned forms of money lacking true property rights.
  In contrast, ETH stands out as a permissionless asset, especially on Layer 1 (L1), where it is both programmable and expands its property rights through rollups. This expansion allows for a broader interaction surface with ETH as a valuable asset.
  The discussion further highlights the implications of inflation on wealth distribution, suggesting that inflation subtly transfers wealth from those unprotected by it to those who are.
  Notably, money does not possess an inherent essence, reinforcing the need to understand the nature of currency and its socio-economic implications.

  Speaker 1
  And so it's kind of important to acknowledge that, sure, USDC and USDT can be programmable, but they're certainly not permissionless money. It's a very permissioned money, in fact. Right. Bad. So to summarize this first half of the talk, we made the argument that ETH is permissionless. First, on the L1, ETH is permissionless and programmable. Rollups scale the property rights of ETH, the asset. Property rights on non-Ethereum DA L2s depend on another chain, but it still kind of expands the effect of ETH of the asset and the amount of surface area you have to interact with it, Which we'll talk about in the following slides. And USDC and USDT have no property rights. Cool. So that was the permissionless part. Now let's talk about ETH as money. And to motivate this section, I have two more quotes. This one from John Maynard Keynes, by a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate secretly and unobserved an important part of the wealth of their citizens. So this kind of motivates the initial part of the ETH is money discussion, where I'll talk about supply, I'll talk about inflation, and kind of how inflation is a process by which kind Of wealth is transferred from those who aren't protected against inflation to those who are. And the second quote is from David Graeber in his book. Money has no essence. ([TimeÂ 0:12:44](https://share.snipd.com/snip/035bccb8-c969-4e1c-baac-05c9bead3b52))
