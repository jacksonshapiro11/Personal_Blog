### Highlights

- Episode AI notes
  1. Setting intentions and being mindful of their impact can have powerful consequences. Good intentions may still have negative consequences. Mindfulness training encourages setting deliberate intentions that shape outcomes in various settings.
  2. Training and understanding adult development theory, specifically subject object theory, is crucial. Subject is what you're fused with, and object is what can be examined. Coaches are taught to listen for subject and object, going below the surface of the story.
  3. Integrity is about energetic wholeness and being fully alive, not just doing the right thing. When in integrity, we're energetically whole and fully alive.
  4. Embracing reality and taking action are important. Avoiding reality is a disservice, and feedback helps improve. Sports teams provide constant feedback.
  5. Success comes from doing things regularly and consistently. Shifting from a victim to a survivor mindset empowers individuals to overcome challenges and embrace the process.
  6. Business is not like a family, it's more like a professional sports franchise focused on the mission. Successful individuals know when to push and when to move on. ([TimeÂ 0:00:00](https://share.snipd.com/episode-takeaways/109abb3b-fbd0-4264-ae30-3d120e73dbc0))

    - **Note:** Overview
- The Power of Setting Deliberate Intentions
  Key takeaways:
  - Intentions play a crucial role in determining consequences.
  - The impact or consequences may not always align with intentions.
  - Mindfulness training encourages setting deliberate intentions.
  - Setting intentions can be inward or outward.
  - Intention setting influences various aspects of life.
  - Long-term vows are a traditional practice in certain types of training.

  Speaker 4
  So the outside, no one could see anything different, right? But your intention was entirely different. It was an accident. You know, when the person comes out, furious, you say, my yes, callerator pedal stuck and they might still be furious and you have to deal with insurance and things. But there will be entirely different consequences because the intention was different. So it becomes really powerful to start to pay attention to our intentions and saying our intentions deliberately. And also, of course, it's important then to notice the impact or the consequences because you could have good intentions and still out of them, there could be a bad impact. So you need to notice that. But one of the beautiful things that mindfulness training invites is the setting of deliberate intention and it can be inwardly or it can be outwardly. Whether it's before an athletic game as you were talking about or whether it's a business meeting or it's, you know, an education or whatever happens to be what's our intention. And setting intention starts to steer everything. There's something in that's quite traditional in the kind of training that I did in which you set these long-term vows. ([TimeÂ 0:03:34](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e5b5af1d-9e0c-4e9d-b960-14acc3a708a1))
    - **Note:** Setting intentions is vital for action whether it being a meeting or situation we need to understand our intention in the situation. If we smack someone in the face vs turning around and hitting them that intention drives a very different outcome. Be mindful and aware of intentions. When you do things do them with care and mindfulness embed meaning into your grocery shopping not just a go go mentality. Be where you are and not lost in your thoughts 90% of thoughts are repeats just live in the moment. Donâ€™t solve the problems of your life just recognize and try to tap into a deeper level of thought. Thought is a good servant but a bad master. We need to control our minds.
- Training in Adult Development Theory
  Key takeaways:
  - The most important takeaway is the training and understanding of adult development theory, specifically the subject object theory developed by Bob Keegan and others.
  - The stage of development in the subject object theory is defined by what is subject and what is object.
  - Being able to recognize what is subject and what is object requires listening below the surface of the story.
  - A key skill for coaches is to listen for words or phrases that make them curious about the speaker's meaning.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 9
  Well, for me, the most important one has been really the training and understanding of adult development theory, particularly the one that my colleagues and I are most, have most depth In, which is the subject object theory that it was developed by Bob Keegan and others. And in the subject object theory, you're, what you're listening for, the stage of development is defined by what is subject and what is object. And when I say subject, what I mean is like what you're fused with, it's like the water you're swimming in, the lens through which you see things but you don't actually even know you have A lens. And what is object is what can be held out and examined and talked about like a value is object if you can see how it's shaping what you do and don't do. A value is subject if it's invisibly shaping what you do and don't do, for example. So in this subject, this growth edge coach training that several of my colleagues and I run, what we're teaching coaches to do is to listen for what is subject and what is object. In listening in that way, you have to be listening below the surface of the story. And every time you hear a word or a phrase wondering, hmm, I wonder what that person means by that. And so it's amping up curiosity. ([TimeÂ 0:16:27](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a289bd93-ff9d-41e9-8a44-78fe0962089b))
    - **Note:** Listen deeply for what is subject and obvious in a conversation and what is object or implied but what someone is saying. We need to be curious to see through their eyes. Listen to learn not to win. We need to get perspective and feedback from others life is about doing something getting feedback and adjusting. Life is a dance of creating a better picture of the world. Donâ€™t confuse complicated and complex one requires doing hard but known things the other about mastering illegible systems. When you fail conventionally you feel absolved of guilt vs trying to do what seems right and uses judgment but might fail leading to negative ev career bet.
- The Definition of Integrity and Its Role in Wholeness and Full Aliveness
  Key takeaways:
  - Integrity is often described as 'doing the right thing', but it can be understood as energetic wholeness.
  - Integrity leads to full aliveness and being energetically whole.
  - Think of integrity as being like a strand of holiday lights - if one goes out, the whole strand dims and eventually goes out.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 3
  The four pillars of integrity I got from Katie Hendricks, Dr. Katie Hendricks. It's been a cornerstone of my life for 30 years or so. So let's begin by just differentiating the way I want to speak about integrity from the way it normally gets talked about. You know, when integrity shows up as a value inside of a company, for example, and then you ask people, what does the value mean? The normal thing that people say is do the right thing, which is beautiful. I get that. Great. And it's really then tends to have more of a, like a moral or an ethical kind of orientation. And the way I play with integrity is none of that. But again, let's just do a little etymology here. So integrity from the root, same root as integer. So think of whole number. Think of wholeness. So that's where I like to go. Think of wholeness. So to me, integrity is energetic wholeness. Now what that translates to very quickly for me is full aliveness. So when I am in integrity, I am energetically whole. I am fully alive. We illustrated sometimes with, it doesn't work so much in work, because I think they fixed this problem. Sometimes it can. And you put holiday lights on a Christmas tree. Kind of the deal was that if one of the lights went out, the whole strand went out, you know, first it might blink a little bit and then it all went out. And if you think about the circuitry of those Christmas lights being a circuit of wholeness, and then if one little light goes out, then they start to dim and dim and dim until they all Go out. ([TimeÂ 0:34:14](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0b5f83c3-7c44-4ace-9eb5-8d19577d6417))
    - **Note:** Integrity is about being fully alive and yourself. To have integrity you need to be radically responsible ie very high agency. You need to be mindful of the world and I tune with your feelings not repressing it. It takes a lot of energy to hold down feelings so you need to embrace them. Part 3 is candor you need to be authentic to yourself to be more alive. When you withhold you create a low trust culture. 4 bring impeccable with agreements donâ€™t lie about yourself and what youâ€™re doing.
- Embracing Reality and Taking Action
  Key takeaways:
  - Working on a problem is better than just thinking about it.
  - Avoiding reality and postponing dealing with it is a disservice.
  - Feedback is valuable for improvement.
  - Sports teams provide constant feedback.
  - The speed and impact of reality are important.
  - The saying about the Gazelle emphasizes the need to stay ahead to survive.

  Speaker 7
  And he said, you know, instead of just thinking about the problem in the last few weeks, we've just started working on it. He's like, and we've only made like 1% progress. But he's like, it's so much better now that we're just working on it. Now we're just working on a problem. Whereas before we were just thinking about it. And I think that that comes from the embracing of, OK, this is where we are. This is what we got to go do about it. And I, I think your point of effectively trying to avoid reality and kind of kick the can down the road and have somebody else have to deal with it. That's a real disservice to someone you care about or someone you love. It's the same point, the reason that feedback is valuable. It's the, you know, I, I think it's the reason that sports teams are a good analogy when they're at the very, at a very high level because the feedback happens every minute. If you're not good enough to be on the floor, if you're not good enough to be on the field, the ball goes by you. Your team might give up a goal. You know, it is quite obvious and the feed mechanisms are quick. And so I think that one of the things that I think about is sort of the speed of reality, how quickly does reality hit you? And what is the impact of reality? And so there's that saying that every morning in Africa, I saw this on Twitter recently, but, you know, every morning in Africa, Gazelle wakes up and knows that if he doesn't outrun the Fastest lion, he's going to die. ([TimeÂ 0:46:05](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5180c47a-91e6-44b3-a484-3a87c5f13942))
    - **Note:** Wake up every day and embrace reality. Not embracing reality has a cost. Donâ€™t aim to be the best be the only you want to do something that an AI canâ€™t easily take over. Donâ€™t be predictable LLMs are the wisdom of the crowd AI but independent thinking will always differentiate. Constraints breed innovation deadlines are important. Unique differentiation. You need to know when you need to stop languishing in theory and commit to a path because you can be stuck in theory forever.
- Importance of Doing Things Regularly & Shifting from Victim to Survivor Mentality
  Key takeaways:
  - Doing things on a regular basis allows for the freedom to fail and try again.
  - Consistency in creating art or content builds confidence and reduces the fear of not meeting high standards.
  - Shifting from a victim mindset to a survivor mindset empowers individuals to overcome challenges and take control of their circumstances.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 6
  Yeah, yeah, that's that's true because it's not good enough yet. One of the things I have become a really big proponent of, which is, you know, doing things on a regular basis. So the advantage of someone like you doing a podcast on a regular basis, like if this one's a complete flop, that's okay. Tomorrow you have another one. We'll try again and you just do it over and over again and you put out whatever it is that you do, you know, you're trying your very best. But you know that that there's more from where that's come from. And that gives you some kind of freedom to fail in a certain sense, because I'm going to do it again. And that's true of a making art, which I do every day. I make a piece of art every day. So I'm going to put it out no matter what. And if it isn't up to the best standards, that's okay, because tomorrow I'm going to do it again. And that's true about writing or anything else is this, this idea that you want to do things on a regular basis, because that is the source of great stuff, but also gives you that confidence And liberty to put out something that's not quite the best and not get really hung up on it, because we're going to do it again. You get another up high. You get another crack at it. Right.
  Speaker 1
  From episode 169, Julie Garner. How do you shift that mindset where circumstances sort of like when you feel your victim, I mean, effectively, you're a victim to circumstance, you feel like you have no control and You're powerless. And there's nothing you can do. What would you say to somebody like that?
  Speaker 2
  That's a really great question. I think that there are two ways of looking at victim things that have happened to you. You know, you can be a victim or you can be a survivor. And those are two very different cognitive positions. You know, you can't control what happens to you in either circumstance. But one is very powerful. You have overcome. ([TimeÂ 1:02:08](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d002c617-0b4f-40f7-adb3-3c6cefb6c8fb))
    - **Note:** You can be a victim or survivor one is deeply powerful the others steals your power. Rewrite the stories in your head so you have agency and power not that youâ€™re helpless. See strength change the story in your mind. You canâ€™t use other events as a reason to self destruct you need to take agency over yourself. You canâ€™t dwell on the past and let it consume you then you lose. Shit happens move on. Donâ€™t ceede power to other people. You can create your own life by having agency over the small moments or let it play out for you. We let life happen to us people will stay unhappy for awhile until they breach a critical mass and finally make a change but why not fight up front. Early intervention leads to a more productive intentional future.
- Navigating the Business World vs Family Dynamics
  Key takeaways:
  - A business is not a family, it is more like a professional sports franchise.
  - In business, the focus is on the mission and respective contributions.
  - Companies may claim to be like a family, but they still lay off employees.
  - Successful individuals know when to walk away and when to push their advantage.
  - Learning to cultivate the skills of knowing when to push and when to let go is important.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Well, you know, we've talked about this quite a bit in recent years. You know, I don't think a business is a family. Unfortunately, in a family, you can't fire your family, even though you sometimes want to, you have to tolerate them and deal with them. And often sometimes in the most egregious way, that is just a nature of families. I mean, you're the oldest function that comes with it. But in business, it's more like being a professional sports franchise, right? You're assembling the best players and, you know, we may be friends, but we don't have to be friends because we're not coming together on the basis of friendship. We're coming together on the basis of mission. You know, in other words, share purpose. You know, we're very demanding of each other. And it's really about, you know, our respective contributions to the to the mission. That's the basis of our relationship. So it is much more akin to professional sports. I think that's the correct analogy. No, some companies don't want to be that way. Companies like Salesforce and even Google come to mind. But, you know, in the end, they're laying people off to by the thousands. OK, so I guess it's not family after all.
  Speaker 1
  From episode 179, Geo Valianti. One thing that the best seemed to be able to do, and I think we hit on this. And that answer is two things stood out there. They know when to walk away. They know when to fold it. They know when to, you know, just OK, it's over. Move on. Next one. They're able to move on. But they also know when to push their advantage. And I'm thinking Tom Brady, right? He was the ultimate sort of quarterback. He would take the checkdown, but he also knew when to push it down the field. How do we learn when to? How do we learn to cultivate those skills in ourselves? How do we know when to push? And how do we know when, you know what, this just isn't going to get us the outcome that we want? ([TimeÂ 1:18:33](https://share.snipd.com/snip/73af40b9-3288-4d95-afe0-74b787ec21bb))
    - **Note:** When do you know when to press your advantage or when you retract. When you have an edge you need to go in but when you donâ€™t you shouldnâ€™t be pushing yourself thatâ€™s sub optimal. Donâ€™t do something to do it only when it makes sense and when it makes sense go full throttle. If you target 10 and can get 20 go for it but if you can only get 5 donâ€™t go for 10. Sometimes you let it happen others you make it happen. Failure helps you see what real opportunity looks like. Know what the advantage looks like and when to press it. We play better as an underdog but we should be chasing some higher goal if thatâ€™s the case not tense up. Too much desire is generally bad. Free markets are functions of desire. Channel desire well because it can inspire or destroy you. Tigers desire made him the best but led to his injuries and marriage failure. Same desire. Know your risk limits what losses can you tolerate understanding yourself what youâ€™ll kick yourself for and what you canâ€™t deal with in the downside. Complex games require complex thought.
