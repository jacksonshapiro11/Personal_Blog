### Highlights

- Any action in the fullness of time sinks to nothing. After the incident cloak who was dealing drugs thought he was mixed up in bunny’s disappearance funny how you can internalize something like this when you did nothing. It’s funny how all of these fake stories come up related to this. Everyone crafting the narrative they want regardless of the truth. Turns out things unravel and these kids who are very insular are realize the world sees them as a joke and larping and they have to appear normal but everyone sees something is off about them and they’re so lost in their own world they don’t realize how stupid they even look. No self awareness Henry almost cracks fucks it up for everyone they’re all just frauds. Everything unravels after Richard is let in. Camilla and Charles are sleeping together. Charles and Francis have slept with each other just shows these kids are so lost. The twins are trying to lead each other on make others jealous. Shows how toxic the relationship is they act rich but they’re just poor and jealous. They even in Julian see him as the distant cold man he is not the benevolent teacher they believe him to be. He and the kids only see what they want you to see. But they realize they are empty and vapid. Julian isn’t a wise man but one who is selfish only sees or does what he wants. Rejects what he doesn’t and has no sympathy for what he sees is below him. Henry ends up shooting and killing himself and the story ends. Henry kills himself with some stoic Greek pride. The twins and Francis don’t come back to school. They never really stayed in touch after they graduated.
- There’s a crucial time in life when character is fixed forever. The students were ignorant of current news only cared about history. Were very regimented in their routines. When something bad happens, action slows to a dream like glide. You’re living, almost framed by frame. Richard is living in Vermont in the winter freezing to death alone hallucinating. Overall horrible experience for him. He’s very alone in these times. Nearly dies. Henry saves Richard’s life and invites him to live with him. The rift between him and bunny becomes clear and Henry comes across as a normal guy who likes to read but is out of touch with society generally. Primal appeal to lose oneself and exist, infinitely in time. When you lose yourself, you become infinite in time. To truly understand things you need to take the right perspective. You cannot understand Dante, unless you take the view of the Christian. It’s a combination of belief and absolute surrender to what you’re doing that creates this progress. That’s how you take this perspective. Time is something that the fires change, birth and decay. Justices whenever everyone knows their place in the world.
- The modern mind is whimsical and discursive. The classical mind is narrow and unhesitating and degressive. Richard is a poor boy who studies Greek goes to college in Hampton from Cali and wants to study Greek which is a secretive office with a strange professor and 5 students. He gets to impress the students in a chance encounter and the professor who rejected him allows him in to his class. This is a very insular area and he is making up a lot of his background to fit in pretending he lives a high flying Cali life. Richard has to be someone he isn’t. He’s an average person in a class of all elites. The first class he walk in on is about the self. Death is the mother of beauty and beauty is terror. Our only desire is to live and live forever. The Greeks were thrown into irrationality despite being generally rational people. The idea of losing control obsesses controlled people. We cannot lose our primitive selves the more cultivated we are the more repressed. Pragmatists and the people who like order are the most superstitious they don’t understand the half spaces of life. Can’t reason it. The fire of pure being. When Richard is getting to know the other five he thinks that they’re secretive and weird, but he doesn’t realize all the things that he’s doing that make him seem standoffish. The value of introspection.
