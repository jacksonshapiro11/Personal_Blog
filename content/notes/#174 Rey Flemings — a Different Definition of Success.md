    - **Note:** Create a market for crazy near impossible things you can easily book an air bnb but a private jet is harder and walking the red carpet is harder and getting secret service protection in another country is near impossible how do you make that impossible possible. Itâ€™s a lot about connections and matching supply and demand creating a market for very rare goods. Finding the demand and matching the proper supply. Happy if/ when bs internal locus of control. Happiness and negativity are contagious we are the sum of our 5 closest friends. We only see the best of the best on social media but how can we have enough. A breakdown in societal trust is a massive issue because most of our system is rooted in trust above all so losing that is a collapse of the system.

    - **Note:** People do what theyâ€™re told and think theyâ€™ll be successful and theyâ€™re just wrong the big lie of upper middle class elite society. Success usually is optimizing for one thing and I ignoring every else which can be very bad. Conspiracy theory of society is wrong. How do we structure society to be better for everyone just one person or group. We all live in one system and we need to be we centric not me centric and grow the pie. Donâ€™t delay great personal change but embrace it. It only compounds and gets worse. You need to face it head on because itâ€™s very uncomfortable but to be free of these things you need to defeat them. You need to face them head on and conquer it. The only way out is through.
