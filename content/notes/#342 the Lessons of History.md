- Modesty is key for humans everyone is born lives and dies we’re here for a short transient time. Life is finite and you only have a certain amount of time so you need to focus on a few very important things and run like hell at them. Tech moves so fast and that changes the world tech moving forward is a law of life and competition is the first law of biology. Competition is constant. Second law is life is selection some people are better equipt to survive inequality is natural, and grows with the complexity of civilization and specializes functions, giving more leverage to individuals with very high-level of specialized skills. Freedom and equality are enemies inequality rises, overtime, and only people below average want equality. Talent is the best asset class utopias of equality are doomed. Human nature never changes. Poor and rich are the same from a human nature point of view. ([Time 0:01:25](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9c947061-9e60-4b65-9cef-cccffa1e169a))

Freedom and equality are enemies talent is the best asset class and human nature never changes
      Make the most of each day focused intensity. Ride the wave. Freedom vs equality and talent as the best asset class.
- Initiative individuals grow from their time and land product and symbol of events and their agent and voice but needs a new situation to bring his ideas to life. Always present but depends on time and place. Hero’s of action need a situation requiring a mew response without this situation they don’t become great men. New ideas are untimely and impracticable need a catalyst for events to occur through him and around him turn him into a hero of action. rebels employs the same tactics they previously fought against and condemned. The immatating majority follows innovating minority who follow the individual in adapting to a new paradigm. Study things that never change in ever age men have been dishonest and humans have been cyrropt a lot stays the same over time. Time tested wisdom better than new wisdom 99% of the time because it’s the knowledge of generations. Study what doesn’t change build around that.

- Repetition and Consistency for Business Leaders
  Summary:
  Consistency in repeating key messages and ideas is crucial for business leaders.
  Taking a cue from religions, where followers revisit their sacred texts and gather regularly to reinforce common beliefs, entrepreneurs can apply the same principle. Just like religious gatherings repeat important lessons to guide actions and life paths, successful entrepreneurs consistently reiterate their core values and ideas over time, ensuring a strong and persuasive message to guide their company's growth.

  Speaker 1
  And I think there's a lot of lessons here for you as you're leading your company because my friend Patrick from the best, like the best, I always say like repetition is persuasive. He put it maybe even better. He says that repetition does not spoil the prayer. And I think one of the main lessons that entrepreneurs and company builders can learn from religions is if you think about all the major religions in the world, right? Usually based on some kind of book, I grew up Christian. So I'll just use that as an example. You know, we don't read the Bible once and I'll be like, all right, I got it. We're good. No, we revisit it. We go back to it. Then we gather, right? We repeat lessons from it over and over and over again. Repetition is persuasive. Repetition does not spoil the prayer. We gather at specific intervals, you know, every Wednesday or every Sunday or whatever, you know, whatever time in your religion, religions have different days of the week or time Periods, but you'll see them consistently. They gather together. Sometimes it's every day and they gather together with people that believe in the same thing that they do and they repeat the lessons that they agree upon and they want to guide their Actions and guide like their path in life. That is very similar. Like if you go back and read any of the shareholders, like the example I used a couple days ago, was Jeff Bezos. There's ideas and phrases and mindsets that are in his very first shareholder in 97 that are in his last one 20 years later. And you see this over and over again, these biographies of entrepreneurs. ([Time 0:22:57](https://share.snipd.com/snip/11af36e0-1343-438a-968b-e7d04cc3c329))
    - **Note:** Religion is ever present and a vital construct in society we must believe. Repetition is persuasive we go to church constantly and repeat the same prayers like bezos reiterates his beliefs in every shareholder letter. Nature doesn’t care about good and bad defines what survives as good and what doesn’t as bad regardless of morality history written by victor’s Machiavelli. All that matters is to survive the rest is just words like Warren keeping a ton of cash. Religion survives every generation. Economics Men manage men who can’t manage themselves and men who managed money rule all. Incentive structures. History is naturally inflationary and people need profit motives eventually to survive not just tricks of capital. Inequality in humanity is inevitable democracy leads to more pursuit of abilities leading to more wealth concentration concentration of wealth is inevitable with periods of break ups.
- Iron Law of Oligarchy and the Importance of Superior Ability
  Summary:
  The iron law of oligarchy highlights that throughout history, governments have been predominantly ruled by a minority due to the inherent differences in human abilities.
  It is believed that minority government is inevitable when the majority of abilities are found in a minority of individuals. The concept links back to the concentration of wealth and the idea that the majority can only periodically replace one minority with another.
  The narrative stresses the importance of investing time in learning and practicing to enhance one's abilities, emphasizing that economic complexity rewards superior ability.
  Additionally, the discussion reflects on the role of war in promoting cooperation as the ultimate form of competition in nations' history.

  Speaker 1
  Now, this is, there is a statement or a reoccurring theme in history called the iron law of oligarchy. And they go into detail about that here. And it has to do with this inherent difference in the abilities of human beings. Most governments have been oligarchies ruled by a minority chosen either by birth or by a religious organization or by wealth. It is unnatural for a majority to rule for a majority can seldom be organized and united and into specific action and a minority can. If the majority of abilities is contained in a minority of men, minority government is as inevitable as the concentration of wealth. See how they tied everything they went like the past few themes together. If the majority of abilities is contained in a minority of men, minority government is as inevitable as the concentration of wealth. The majority can do no more than periodically throw out one minority and set up another. And so the summary there is the iron law of oligarchy. And so a few pages later, it goes back to this idea that you and I keep talking about this is why it's just so much of your time learning and practicing so you can be better at your craft. Every advance in the complexity of the economy puts an added premium upon superior ability. And so a lot earlier in the book, we went over the fact that in the biology and history chapter that war is a nation's way of eating, it promotes cooperation because it's the ultimate form Of competition. ([Time 0:31:09](https://share.snipd.com/snip/152fdb50-78e3-4e05-8501-b354e1d15028))
    - **Note:** Every advance in history leads to more concentration. Oligarchy is the natural state of government due to talent being unevenly distributed and thus a few being better equit to rule. Life is competition and war is constant providing the greatest ability to create but also destroy. War is a source of ideas. War is driven by need to be acquisitive spread pride take resources and it must use any means necessary for survival 10 commandments must be ignore when self preservation is at stake. Creative individuals with capability of will to create effective responses to challenges are why we grow and decay with and without these people things die but true creatives are immortal people still read Plato and Homer even. Th ough. They’re long dead. Stability of great minds. Humans will always find a way to be unhappy because it’s human nature so we must be aware of our essential nature and choose happiness. Technology is new means solving old ends. Education is the transmission of civilization we grow because we stand on the shoulder of giants. There is no meaning in our lives we must embed meaning and maybe even create and pass wisdom such hat we can transcend generations.
