### Highlights

- Lyndon Johnson's rare talent: Counting Votes
  Summary:
  Lyndon Johnson's exceptional talent was his ability to accurately count votes, a rare skill that set him apart from others.
  This talent was developed as a result of his father's optimistic nature leading to failures from wishful thinking and overlooking unpleasant facts. While many tend to overestimate their support, Johnson remained realistic and precise in his counts by learning from his father's costly mistakes of optimism.
  This talent became a crucial asset in Johnson's political career, enabling him to accurately assess situations and make informed decisions.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Now, what's the relationship of this to Lyndon Johnson's political activities? Of all of his political activities, one of the most remarkable was his ability to count votes. This is incredible. Caro is about to describe why and how Lyndon's father's faults gave birth to Lyndon's greatest talent. Vote counting to be right in your count when you have to be right is a very rare ability. Most people tend to be much more optimistic in their counts than the situation deserves. True believers were always inclined to attribute more votes to their side than actually existed. But Lyndon Johnson never had that problem. His father had been the man of optimism. Great optimism. Lyndon had seen firsthand when his father failed the cost of optimism, of wishful thinking, of hearing what one wants to hear, of failing to look squarely at unpleasant facts. Because his father purchased the Johnson ranch for a price higher than was justified by the hard financial facts, Lyndon Johnson had felt firsthand the consequences of romance and Sentiment, of optimism, false optimism. For many people, it's just an unfortunate personal characteristic. For Lyndon Johnson, it was the bite of the reins into his back as he shoved hour after hour under that merciless hill country sun, pushing the Fred's know through the sun baked soil. ([Time 0:06:16](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2b186fba-b023-43c6-bf88-0e033795914d))
    - **Note:** Lyndon’s dad was too blindly optimistic and he overvalued the ranch which greatly effected the life of his family growing up. He was a blind dreamer Lydon swore never to be this and was a gross optimist. Johnson by talking to people could know how they would vote exactly. Lived with his fathers mistakes and knew cost. He was ruthless because he was well acquainted with the deep cost of failure.
- Choosing Books for a Podcast Episode
  Summary:
  The speaker selects books for podcast episodes by choosing the one he is most excited to learn about at the moment.
  He was inspired to pick a particular book after watching a Dr. Manery. The book he selected is different from his usual choices and is intended to share his experiences and discoveries about himself.
  The book's introduction reminds him of a story about Steve Jobs at a challenging moment in his life, emphasizing the burning desire to achieve despite circumstances.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And so I go every week, when I, I don't have a schedule for like what I'm going to do next. I just go and look at the books that I have and ask like one of my most excited to learn about right now. And that's, I just basically, that's how I pick the next book that I want to make a podcast on. And so when I go that, when I went to the shelf after watching that Dr. Manery, this book jumped out. It's like, okay, no, I can't wait no longer have to do this. So I'm going to jump right into the introduction. He's just going to tell us what this book is about and why he is doing it. So he says, here's a book very unlike the others that I've written very much shorter for one thing, but its intention is to share some experiences that I've had while doing the others. That's not the only thing that's in the book. He continues. And here also a few things I discovered about myself along the way about what I wanted to do with my life and my books, which are my life. He italicized, which are my life. That comes to the very first note in the book. When I got to, we're like a paragraph, a couple paragraphs into the book. The way he's talking here reminds me of a story I learned in a biography of Steve Jobs I never forgotten. Steve Jobs, 30 years old, he just got kicked out of Apple. This is before he founds next, before he founds Pixar and he's walking around, I think, Paris with his girlfriend. And you know, he's got the equivalent of about like $200 million at that point. Never has to work again in his life if he doesn't have to. And he's just had this burning desire to achieve something.

- The Unseen Level of Political Power and Ruthlessness: Insights from a Biographer
  Summary:
  The biographer discovered a previously unknown level of political power and ruthlessness that surpassed what he had learned in textbooks or experienced as a political reporter.
  His dedication to writing biographies of figures like Robert Moses and Lyndon Johnson was not solely about detailing accomplishments, but rather about understanding how power operates and explaining the reality of the world. This revelation led to a significant shift in his perspective, challenging conventional teachings about power dynamics.
  Additionally, the biographer's meticulous approach to his work, resulting in long gaps between book releases, can be attributed to his deep dive into unraveling the complexities of power dynamics.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  That there was a whole level of political power, not what I had learned from textbooks and lectures in college, and not even what I had learned as a political reporter, but a level of which I had hardly ever conceived. I had learned there was a whole level of ruthlessness too, of which I also hadn't conceived. And he's a very young man when these conversations are happening. And I guess this is where I want to pause this. So he has technically dedicated his entire life to writing two biographies, one of them is multiple parts, a biography of Robert Moses, a biography of Lyndon Johnson. That is not how he views his work, just as writing biographies of people that accomplish a lot, biographies of great men. He wants to understand how power works. He wants to understand and to be able to explain to others how the world actually works. So this is the first time he mentions it. He mentions it multiple times that there is a whole, the world works, powers accrued, and also utilized very differently from what he was taught in college, what he learned in textbooks, And what he learned in lectures. Remember that part because we're going to revisit multiple times. The book also offers a few glimpses into why I work the way that I do. Into why, for example, it takes me so long to produce my books. Usually it's about an eight to ten year gap between each book. ([Time 0:12:30](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a5db33dd-bbbf-45fc-ba52-2f2df41588f3))
    - **Note:** His goal was to learn how power worked and why people did what they did. He doesn’t see his career as books written but a bigger mission of a holistic study of power. He was criticized as writing with his fingers and not thinking in college then as a professional focused on being deliberate with his processs. His favorite thing wasn’t writing but sitting with his notes all day thinking and researching. He can’t do anything rushed. He was poor and needed the money and missed deadlines but couldn’t compromise on his process. He had no choice in his process. He must turn every rock over he has to tell the full story or else it’s wholly incomplete.
- Robert Caro's Love for Books and Dysfunctional Childhood
  Summary:
  Robert Caro fell in love with books during his difficult childhood, where his mother's death led him to avoid going home.
  His dysfunctional relationship with his father shaped his talents, similar to Lyndon B. Johnson. Despite graduating from Princeton, Caro faced prejudice at Newsday, where he proved his worth after being hired as a joke.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  It hits you in the face that the same applies to Robert Caro. This is unbelievable. And so these are just some of the notes. I don't think these are direct quotes from the documentary, but I'm just typing these and jotting these down as I'm watching this. And I watched this twice. And what I realized about a young Robert was that he fell in love with books when he was young. He had a rotten childhood. His favorite place was the library. He would go to the library, check out a book, take it and read it in Central Park so he didn't have to go home. Why didn't he want to go home? His mother dies of breast cancer. I keep like pounding on the book. I don't know if you can hear that. His mother dies of breast cancer. She thinks she gets sick when he was five. She finally passes away when he was 11. And for the rest of his life, he never wanted to come home. When he came home, his father yelled and his father screamed. But the point is that the source, the source of both Johnson's and Caro's greatest talents came from the dysfunctional relationship that they both had with their fathers. Okay, so I'm going to stop pounding on the book and I'm going to read from the book. This is when he winds up getting an offer. This is 1959. Newsday had a managing editor named Alan Hathaway. This guy becomes very, very important to Robert's life. He had a deep prejudice against graduates of prestigious university. So Robert had graduated from Princeton. The people at Newsday hired me as a joke on him while he was on vacation. ([Time 0:21:35](https://share.snipd.com/snip/383fccaa-1280-4429-a97a-f99272ccceaa))
    - **Note:** Caro and Johnson were defined by their bad home life and toxic relationship with their dads. He went to Princeton and got hired at new day as a joke because his boss was out and hated Ivy leaguers. He got his shot because everyone was at a picnic and did amazing investigative journalism got lost in the files all night and his boss made him an investigative journalist on the spot. He gave him his life Motto which was turn every page.
- Robert Caro and the Unbelievable Power of Robert Moses in Albany
  Summary:
  Robert Caro witnessed the incredible power of Robert Moses in Albany when officials who opposed a certain project suddenly supported it after a visit from Moses.
  This abrupt change highlighted Moses' remarkable ability to influence decision-making in the state government, a power he had held for over 40 years. Caro's realization during his drive home from Albany showcased his critical self-talk, similar to that of Lyndon Johnson.
  Despite being a chronicler of political power, Caro was left perplexed by the origins of Moses' exceptional influence.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And so that's where Robert wants to happen. He has an unbelievable amount of power at this time. So Robert Caro is up there. Everybody in Albany says, no, we're not going to do this. He says, okay, well, there's no story here. I'll drive back home. And a few weeks went by and nothing changed until Robert Moses wanted them to change a couple weeks later. A friend called me and said, Bob, I think you better come back up here, meaning to Albany. And I said something like, Oh, I don't think that's necessary. I think I took care of that bridge. He said, Bob, Robert Moses was up here yesterday. And I think you better come back. So I drove back up and I'll never forget this. When I went back to the same officials who had assured me that they were firmly against the bridge, they were now firmly for it. I remember I drove home that night all the way down from Albany to our house on Long Island. It was 163 miles. I kept thinking everything you've been doing is bullshit. So that piece of negative self talk. This is not the first time. This is something he also, uh, another trait that Robert Caro shares with Lyndon Johnson that I'll talk about later. This fact that they have these, this almost like hyper critical self talk of themselves in their head. Everything you've been doing is bullshit. Robert Moses had enough power to turn around a whole state government in one day. And he's had that power for more than 40 years. And you Bob Caro, who are supposed to be writing about political power and explaining it, you have no idea where he got this power. ([Time 0:25:16](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1cf0b8c0-1e15-40fc-99b6-864a0f9a3d83))
    - **Note:** He randomly got put on a bridge project had won a few awards and was cocky thinking he was a genius. He was assured the bridge wasn’t going up but after one visit from Robert Moses everyone changed their tune. This clear display of absolute power completely changed his life and path. At 29 he got a fellowship to take a year off and learn more about his craft from Harvard planners who wrote the book on city planning. In that moment he realizes this mathematical equations had no impact on the world things happened because Robert Moses wanted them to happen. It was all bullshit and he went to learn what true power was.
- The Power Broker author's financial struggles
  Summary:
  The author of The Power Broker faced financial struggles while writing the book, starting with no savings and relying on a fellowship to support his family.
  Despite anticipating to finish the book in nine months, financial difficulties persisted for four years. The author even reached a point of desperation, asking for the other half of his advance, only to be told that the book might have a small printing.
  Despite facing discouragement and financial challenges, The Power Broker was eventually published in 1974.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  But this is another what what what he has in common with a lot of entrepreneurs that you and I study is the fact that he talked about like if they knew how hard at the very beginning or even Before they they started their company, if they knew how hard it was going to be, they would have never done it. And so he he had no idea it was going to take, you know, seven more than seven years to finish. When I first began writing the power broker, we didn't have any savings to speak of. And we had a small son. I heard about something called the Carnegie Fellowship, which took one working journalist at a time and paid him his weekly salary for a year while he wrote a book. And so he tells his wife, they're going to be paying me for a whole year. And I have this outline, I'll be done in nine months. At the end of the year, we were completely out of money. And for the next four years, money was a problem. And so he is broke and struggling for many years. He says there came a time when we really totally ran out of money. I just didn't have any place to turn. My editor took me out to dinner and I said, can I please have the other half of my advance? There are sentences that are said to you in your life that are chiseled into your memory. And his reply was one. Oh, no, Bob, I guess you didn't understand. We like the book, but not many people are going to read a book on Robert Moses. And you have to be prepared for a very small printing. So I want to pause there. Because after this, Daniel has one of the worst nights in his entire life. But here's another example of people telling you trying to tell you how successful you will be in your life, which is complete and utter bullshit. The power broker was published in 1974. ([Time 0:29:12](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9f01d4e1-2692-4965-ac8c-63aa2d28add4))
    - **Note:** Caro was dirt poor and his book took 7x longer than he thought. Likely had he known that he never would’ve tried. His agent said no one would read a book on Robert Moses. The book has been printed 47 times. Don’t let others define your success. Take it. His agent didn’t believe in him and he almost quit but he got a shot at a new agent and grabbed it. You need people who believe and support you when you’re doing something hard. Find the right partners and it’ll change everything. He had the same editor fir 41 years. He had no savings sold his house and had a newborn he almost quit. Excellence is the capacity to take pain. He in his search for a new editor gets wined and dined by all accept one who requests he come to his office at lunch. He chooses him. His agent believed in him to get him the money.
- Robert Moses' ruthless use of power to sway votes in his favor
  Summary:
  Robert Moses demonstrated a ruthless approach to gaining power by exploiting weaknesses of opponents.
  In one instance, he secured a favorable vote by leveraging a legislator's financial vulnerability and influencing a key financial figure. Moses was adept at identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities to manipulate outcomes, even resorting to threats and coercion to ensure compliance with his agenda.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Now he's actually sitting down for an interview at this point with Robert Caro. On the Jones Beach appropriation, it was eight to seven against us in the ways and means committee he would say. But the key, this is again the ruthlessness that those that accrue power you actually use and implement that power. That is a key theme in the work of Robert Caro, what he's trying to explain to us. But the key was that this little upstate guy, and then he named some long forgotten state assemblyman, and he had a mortgage coming due on his farm. And the mortgage was held by a bank up there. And the key to the bank was Charles Hewlett, who was the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. And the governor knew how to get to Hewlett, so it was eight to seven for us. So what just happened there? Robert Moses said this guy was going to vote against us. Then I looked for where he was weak. I found where he was weak. Then I found somebody that could push on that weakness until he changed his vote. And if he went against me, I would have foreclosed on his farm. And this was not a one off instance with Robert Moses. This was how he did business a few pages later. I asked Moses why Epstein had changed his mind. He changed it, Moses said, after he was hit over the head with an axe. When I asked him what that meant, he said, I won't tell you what we did to him. He did tell me though. He said, we put our bloodhounds. ([Time 0:35:21](https://share.snipd.com/snip/09c19e45-5099-4208-b8fb-71f4ceff499c))
    - **Note:** The ruthlessness needed to accrue power. Moses would do anything to get a vote over the line and find the weak point. One vote was 7-8 he realized one of the 8 against had a farm that could’ve been foreclosed on. He got his friend at the bank to threaten to foreclose on him to flip his vote. Tricky ruthless. Moses had a ruthlessness that was paired with a geniusness of vision and savage energy. He literally couldn’t be beaten he would always expose you. Moses would go on savage tirades denting walls and hurtling things at aides heads.
- Why ambitious people need to be around other ambitious people
  Summary:
  Ambitious people need to be around other ambitious people because when surrounded by like-minded individuals, they thrive and are encouraged to reach their full potential.
  Founder Paul Graham emphasizes the importance of ambitious individuals being in the company of peers who share similar aspirations. Graham believes that when ambitious individuals are mixed randomly with others, they may lack the support and motivation they need.
  However, when placed in an environment with other ambitious people, they flourish and receive the encouragement necessary to succeed.
  This support is crucial, especially during times of doubt and uncertainty, as ambitious individuals can feel isolated and overwhelmed when facing challenges alone.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Coming across something a few months ago, I had spent I think three weeks reading and rereading all of Paul Graham's essays. I think it's episode 275, 276 and 277. And there's something he talks about. There's a bunch of themes that Paul repeats throughout his writing, but one of them is that founders need to be around other founders. And he has a few different ways of saying this. I think the best way to describe this is that I'm going to read an excerpt from his essays on really why ambitious people need to be around other ambitious people. And I want you to remember what Paul writes for the section we're about to go to because it comes at a time of Robert, I keep saying, Caro, I know it's Caro. That's why I'm just going to call him Bob. When Bob's life where he is struggling with doubt and uncertainty, he's completely isolated. He feels like the project's never going to be finished. He feels like a failure because it's taking so long. And I think he's on your, I don't know, four or five when a project he thought would take him nine months. And so Paul Graham says, ambitious people are rare. So if everyone is mixed together randomly, as they tend to be early in people's lives, then the ambitious ones won't have many ambitious peers. When you take people like this and put them together with other ambitious people, they bloom. Remember this sentence. Remember this sentence where we are in Bob's life. They bloom like dying plants given water. Probably most ambitious people are starved for the sort of encouragement they'd get from ambitious peers. ([Time 0:38:39](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0aa978b5-3e0b-490a-8c5f-cc5d3d723591))
    - **Note:** Ambitious people need to be surrounded by likewise ambitious people or they can’t be successful. He was so dejected because he was living in a world starved of peers Caro needed peers and support. He needed to discuss problems with other writers. He got into a writers room and talked to famous writers who told him it took them 9 and 7 years to write books and this gave him comfort in the 5 years it was taking him. Gave him perspective to wipe his doubt. Big theme is just how much do you want it. The reward for great work is more work. He spent more time mining at the lbj library it was deliberately inefficient search but this extra work unearthed things no one else founded and yielded unexpected diamonds.
- Lyndon Johnson's Terrible youth: Understanding the character hardening environment
  Summary:
  The snip illustrates the harsh upbringing of Lyndon Johnson, characterized by his father's constant belittlement, which instilled in him a sense of failure and worthlessness.
  Johnson's childhood was depicted as tumultuous and devoid of the idyllic tales often associated with youth. This environment, compounded by the strained relationship with his father, is portrayed as the source of Johnson's character hardening.
  The snip emphasizes the importance of reflecting on and understanding the impact of one's past experiences, particularly in shaping personality and resilience.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  You're just not college material, are you? Goddamn it. You're just a failure, Lyndon. You're just a failure, Lyndon. And you're always going to be a failure. And Lyndon would shout back, what are you? You're a bus inspector. That's what you are. Sitting there against the wall, I felt I was getting closer to the heart of Lyndon Johnson's boyhood. Now, Sam Houston, I want you to tell me about all those wonderful stories about Lyndon when you both were boys. There was a long pause. Tell me those wonderful stories again about you growing up. I can't, Sam Houston said. Why not? I asked because they never happened. I now had a picture of Lyndon Johnson's youth, that terrible youth, that character hardening youth. And when I got to that sentence, the point of reading is to understand, right? It's not just to like put my eyes on the page and run across the words and like I'm done. It's to stop. It's to think about what the hell is going on. I had a different picture of Lyndon Johnson's youth, that terrible youth, that character hardening youth. This is the environment that hardens a person, that kind of childhood, that kind of relationship with his father. And yet again, maybe Robert Caro understood this when he's writing this and maybe that's why he's writing it. But maybe he didn't. ([Time 0:47:57](https://share.snipd.com/snip/be1d195e-d773-420a-838a-fe9a87ebc963))
    - **Note:** Caro needed to move to the hill country to understand Lyndon Johnson at a deep level and harassed his brother to learn more about their collective youth. Going the extra mile. Caro had no choice but to do this crazy deep research. Caro and Johnson had the same ruthlessness to work harder than anyone to be the best and negative self talk to motivate them. Johnson had terrible negative self talk and he learned this from his driver.
- Lyndon Johnson's Self-Talk: Insights From His Chauffeur
  Summary:
  Lyndon Johnson engaged in self-talk, having discussions with himself about his daily performance and voter impressions.
  He would reflect on his mistakes, criticize himself, and rehearse future speeches out loud. This self-reflection and determination to succeed quickly and efficiently stood out to many, showcasing his relentless drive to excel.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Who would really know what this means? I thought there's one guy who's with Lyndon Johnson most of the day and it's not his campaign manager. It's his chauffeur. I kept coming back to him. I would ask, what was Johnson doing between campaign stops? What was he doing in the backseat? Finally he told me that Johnson often would be talking to himself. It was like he was having discussions with himself about whether he had a successful day. Whether he had made a good impression on voters or not. And so I'd say, what do you mean by that? And he'd say, well, lots of time he felt he wasn't doing too good. And he would tell himself that it was his own fault. Johnson would say to himself, boy, wasn't that dumb. You know you just lost that ballot box. You lost it and you need it. And he would talk out, rehearse over and over again, out loud. What he would say to the voters in that precinct the next time. This book is incredible. I really hope I can convince you to get a copy for yourself. I want to close with what is my favorite story in the entire book. I think it's a story that a lot of entrepreneurs can relate to the determination to outrun desperation. Lyndon is 23 in this story. I wasn't fully understanding what these people were telling me about the depth of Lyndon Johnson's determination, about the frantic urgency, the desperation to get ahead and to get Ahead fast. ([Time 0:53:05](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1cbce0c4-6202-40c1-91f8-0d56e9c6fdf2))
    - **Note:** Johnson had the determination to outrun uncertainty. Desperate to get ahead and get ahead fast. He learned quickly and was desperate to learn he came to work running every day. He came to dc with only 1 coat he had to succeed. He literally ran to work. Every day he ran to work from the land of povert to the marble buildings of the capital.
