- Microsoft just bet on everything tangentially related to an emerging area so with the internet they took probablistic diversified bets on how they thought the future could look and they were approximately right with pcs and the internet. When you’re distribution becomes your competition, your screwed this happened in that game. They were distributed through and leveraged windows os then got destroyed when windows created internet explorer. Apple did a deal with Microsoft the license office which patient was saved Apple. Microsoft was the most powerful and only company in the consumer internet. They basically saved Apple and destroyed Netscape. They had pretty much 100% of the consumer internet.

    - **Note:** They took a diversified bet that was directionally but not exactly correct. Varied bets that prepared for a clear outcome of an uncertain future. Leverage points and power when your distribution is your competition youre fucked. Microsoft had a functional monopoly.
      Monopoly diversified bets control the distribution platform business
- The antitrust trial was a killer for Microsoft and the DOJ both sides ended up looking slightly stupid and childish and Microsoft’s image as the best company in the world was destroyed. Microsoft after the doj stuff basically invented an enterprise muscle and invented bundling. They realized they could sell to enterprises and IT admins and what they had was so good people didn’t even want upgrades sales team pushed back against all but the smallest changes. They basically invented sales to the enterprise. Completely new go to market. They had 40% of revenue was from 3 year enterprise agreements and 15% from 1 year. They also promised backwards compatibility. 30% they were selling the oem. They were basically whale hunting which was very profitable for them. New tech businesses model. The ibm model. With Microsoft money was never the issue the key thing was developer time in the market. They had so much money but couldn’t afford to lose their competitive advantage ([Time 1:22:04](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3e89cd57-3a4e-4b59-9406-34446c4de23a))

    - **Note:** Microsoft had anti trust issues and they lost their reputation and the DOJs reputation very quickly. They needed to pivot and basically do innovation with withered tech and sell to enterprises the IBM model, but they invented a new enterprise sales strategy and launched the SaaS revolution. Beginning of a movement. Ironically good developers were their constraint not money they had infinite money but finite time to maintain their competitive advantage. Critical mass of smart people needed for everything. Their customers also didnt want big changes they wanted things to not change and just to work. Deep self awareness of the job to be done
- The Impact of CEO Role on Company's Direction
  Summary:
  The former senior level executive at Amazon became a key figure in the company.
  Speculation suggests that Bill's shift from CEO to chief software architect might have influenced Microsoft's direction post the antitrust challenges. The shift possibly affected the company by limiting Bill's engagement with OEM partners, enterprises, and customers, allowing for issues like the longhorn black home disaster to occur due to a focus on technical decisions without considering broader feedback and strategic implications.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Yeah. Yep. He went to Amazon. He was like a named top senior level executive at Amazon for a long time. Wow. You know, and then the other thing about this whole process that this is purely my own speculation, like nobody said this, but just as I've been thinking and reflecting on how seminal A moment the antitrust stuff was to Microsoft after the height of their consumer power right beforehand, I think this might be a case where Bill no longer being CEO and just being chief Software architect really impacted this process. When you're a CEO, you have to engage with your OEM partners. You have to engage with enterprises. You have to engage with customers. And not that it's all Bill's fault by any means, but this longhorn black home disaster, that as you say, was a case of getting high on your own supply within the company.
  Speaker 1
  And if he's only spending his time on technical decisions, you need some introduction into that feedback loop, some governor on how deep to go in re -architecting windows for re -architecting Windows to sake. Right. ([Time 2:27:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8405433b-33a5-40f6-9944-e33c5d43a971))
    - **Note:** Bill Gates was so in the weeds building a new OS never talking with customers and this lack of a strong feedback loop led to the system flopping. Need to be rooted in reality. Vista being bad cost dev time and lost credibility with the dev ecosystem. Mac vs pc commercial. The company tries many times to get into consumer through search and mobile and tablets and just get outcompeted the perception has never been more negative but enterprise has never been stronger. Stock is flat but revenue keeps growing. They the. Hire Ray Ozzie to figure out the Microsoft vision through an acquahire. He had invented lotus notes. He comes up with the idea that enterprises might not want data centers but to rent server capacity. This launches azure and cloud compute under balmer that matures under satya. This destroyed an entire division they put a few of their best engineers on it skunksworked it. But they did it despite knowing it would kill them because they knew the opportunity was so big. They believed and built for a cloud first future. They then went public made this the servers business entire business fired the guy in charge because they needed a shift not because he was bad and gave it to satya who was running bing and azure just blew the doors off rousing success.
- The Power of Telling the Right Story
  Summary:
  Telling a compelling story is crucial for a company's success.
  Microsoft struggled because it failed to communicate its strategy effectively, causing investors, consumers, and developers to be in the dark. When Satya Nadella took over, the company's messaging was reset, emphasizing being a mobile-first, cloud-first company, which proved to be a game-changer.
  Consistently repeating a clear message is key, as seen in Satya Nadella's tenure at Microsoft.

  Speaker 2
  You know, it's funny, when you asked this question a minute ago, I hadn't prepared for it ahead of time because as listeners know, we don't share notes. The first thing that popped into my mind about why Wall Street did not appreciate the revenue and profit growth during this time was just simply like Microsoft did not do a good job telling Its story. And I think you're saying the same version here. Like it's so funny. I mean it's part of why I love doing acquired part of why I think the show resonates with people. Telling stories is the most important thing. If you cannot tell your story right and in a compelling fashion, this is what's going to happen to your stock price, even if you triple revenues and profits and build Azure and all these Things.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah. I mean, consumers had no idea what Microsoft strategy was and neither did developers. So neither did investors. Yep. CIOs probably did sort of, but they were probably like, what's going on in search and what's going on? Yeah. Sorry. What's Zune? Is it winning against iPod? Oh, it's losing. Oh, mobile, it's losing too, huh.
  Speaker 2
  And it's for another episode, but it really was brilliant. What Satya did and the company did when he came in, they got the story right. The messaging reset. This is a mobile first cloud first company. That was it. That was the key. Just saying those words over over and over again.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, anyone who's listening who's a leader at a company right now knows that the right amount of repeating yourself to do is about 10 times more than you think it is. You need to just keep delivering the same message over and over and over again. And that wins. The other way to sort of look at Steve Ballmer's tenure is against what else was going on in technology from 2000 to 2014. So on the one hand, like we've been talking about, you have the rise of Google and search and you have social networking with Facebook. And yes, you absolutely can compare a CEO to these category defining startups that are in adjacent fields. ([Time 4:14:20](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ee3a844f-16fe-448d-bf57-d2816d6992a6))
