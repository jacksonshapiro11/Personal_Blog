  Speaker 1
  So my mother's brothers decided that it'd be wiser to liquidate the prosperous business, which had belonged first to my grandfather, and then later to my father, believing that in This way, we children could be better prepared for life without having to call upon anyone for help. His life would have been very different without his uncles and that decision to actually liquidate the business and then take that money and actually send them to boarding school, Which I'll get into why that's so important for the founding Rolex in one second. But he talks a little bit about the fact that one of the best things his uncles ever did for him and his siblings was that they taught himself for lines. But keep in mind, the words I'm reading you, Hans is writing them. He is in his mid 60s. He's looking back at his life. And so he says, our uncles were not indifferent to our fate. They made me become self-reliant very early in life. Looking back, I believe that it is to this that much of my success is due. Now, this part is really important. There's going to be a few times where I'm going to talk to you today about things that happen early in Hans life. He doesn't understand. So you and I talk about this over and over again, the idea that the world is a classroom, like the books that you're reading, the knowledge and skills that you're acquiring, the relationships You're building, you have no idea that the opportunities that they unlock in the future, you just can't possibly predict it. And so they're going to put them in a boarding school. So I'm going to read this to you and I'm going to say why this is so important to the founding of Rolex.

    - **Note:** Self reliance and how early experiences shape you his experience in boarding school learning languages helped create Rolex you can’t connect the dots looking forward. He worked in Switzerland selling pocket watches using his language skills at 19. Then moved to England doing the same thing then starts his own company to do the same thing. He loved pocket watches but loved wrist watches. Prior to WW1 wearing a wrist watch was the same thing as wearing a dress for men. Hans believed in the wristwatch, and there were many technical issues like durability and reliability from being on the hand and being jerked around all day that had to be solved to make it good problems are opportunities in work clothes. Kept faith in wrist watches replaced pocket watches. Realized pocket watches lasted 100 years and we’re passed down for wrist. Watches would have her wear and tear would be a fashion statement and require more frequent sales to build a stronger business on. Better business idea for pocket watches. Saw wrist watch would also be a fashion statement. He commitment to wrist watches before it caught on deeply believed in it. Highest order bit is believing in yourself. He built for a future he saw and helped changed the perception. Rode the wave once the world pivoted. All belief he could change the entire industry.
- Building a Legacy on Handshake Deals
  Summary:
  Eglar and Rolex started with a handshake deal, with no paperwork, that lasted for decades.
  Hans Eglar would travel from London to Switzerland several times a year to bring new design ideas for Rolex watches, leading to the launch of hundreds of models worldwide. This arrangement showcased the power of keeping one's word and leveraging past experience in the industry to build a successful business.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And the deal was that Eglar would make movements solely for Rolex. And when they say, there's a great line in the podcast episode, when he's like, when I say an actual handshake deal, I mean a handshake deal. There was nothing on paper. There was nothing in writing all the way up until 2004 when Rolex finally buys Eglar, undoubtedly, undoubtedly at that point in 2004, Rolex is already making selling billions of dollars Worth of watches. That's nuts. And I just love that. You know, two founders of companies coming together say, Hey, we're gonna work together. I'm a man of my word. We're gonna seal this with a handshake. And that relationship and agreement was unbroken for seven decades. That's one of the coolest things I've ever heard. And so Hans is gonna describe. So you have the manufacturing and the making of Rolex watches are what's gonna be sold under Rolex brand, which I haven't even got there yet. He's gonna happen in Switzerland. He's still in London. So the design and the sales is separate from the manufacturing. And so he would travel from London to Switzerland several times a year. And he says, I would bring with my collaborators new and personal idea is demanding that they be realized in this way, hundreds of models were conceived and launched all across the world. He's selling this again. This goes back to the world's entire classroom. You have no idea how you're going to use all the experience you have. Remember, he was he worked for an importer. They were taking Swiss watches and sending them everywhere. So he's just doing the same thing now with his own products. ([Time 0:20:59](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ddf8eadb-92fb-49ac-b272-8432fc6f11ad))
    - **Note:** He starts with import export of all wrist watches, but is building for the future and sees eggsdorf created a novel watch movement that could be robust in smaller watches. He’s always building toward the future while supporting his present idea. He had a 70 year exclusive deal with them on a handshake to only make watches for them until Rolex bought his company. He’s selling under a ton of different brand names not Rolex, but realizes he wants to specialize and make a product. He’s constantly iterating with brand names and trial and error made expensive made very cheap watches. He tried to sell at all different price points but then realizes He wants to build one differentiated brand, not this portfolio of brands with no focus. When he’s picking the name, he wants something that will fit on the watch and it’s easy to say in all languages developing a good brand. An idea that is easy to understand it’s easy to spread. Create clear marketing message.
- Investing in Marketing and Advertising for Brand Success
  Summary:
  Rolex's success can be attributed to their early and continuous investment in marketing and advertising.
  By dedicating significant financial resources to advertising, Rolex was able to establish themselves as the leading watch brand in the United States. Even during times of economic downturn, Rolex persisted in their marketing efforts while competitors retreated, ultimately solidifying their market dominance.

  Speaker 1
  Not only does he do so, but he did Rolex continues to do so. So he says, I decided to launch the Rolex trademark by means of an intensive advertising campaign. This policy entailed an annual expenditure of more than 12,000 British pounds, not for one year alone, but for several in succession. So I want to go back to how important this is. I want to go back to that business breakdowns episode on Rolex called Timeless Excellence. So it says Rolex was effectively the first people to have real marketing dollars put behind a watch. Rolex did this in a concentrated way and they have continued to do it in a way that is simply just unmatched by others in their industry. Rolex has been the number one brand for watches in the United States, historically speaking, from the 1950s to today. Now, I want to fast forward way ahead in the story. Many, many years after Hans died, because I think this idea is so important. And I'm going to show where I've seen this idea. Other people use this idea successfully as well in a different industry. So go back to the transcript from this episode. The financial crisis of 2008, all the other brands, the competitors, you know, Omega, Tag Heuer, all these other brands that are quote competitors to Rolex. When the financial crisis happens in 2008, they pull back on their marketing. Rolex did not Rolex put the pedal down. And it was really 2008, 2009, 2010, which really elevated Rolex in the United States to a level that it is today. ([Time 0:26:44](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f3d6dcfc-fd63-4da3-a831-80522b17e24e))
    - **Note:** Rolex was the first company to market watches to people with an ongoing marketing expense. They continued this tradition and during the 2008 crisis all other watch manufacturers stop marketing, but they never did and this really allowed them to gain dominant market share. This was a turning point in the us. Izzy sharpe founder of 4 seasons When other brands cut back in recession, you need to keep that momentum or raise advertising because that’s a time to take market share not a time to play defense. Retailers used to put their names on watches but he wanted to put his name Rolex on it. He wanted to fight for control and sell Rolexes with his brand name so he could control quality and marketing this changes his business. Usually watchmakers had to come to retailers, but through his marketing and business strategy, he cultivated desire around Rolex and retailers, had to come to him, transferring the power in the industry
- Executing Key Business Principles Over Decades
  Summary:
  The founder recognized that building demand and brand recognition were crucial for business success.
  By focusing on three key principles - precision, waterproofing, and self-winding - it took him two decades to fully achieve his vision, starting the journey back in 1905. He successfully turned the tables on retailers by making customers demand Rolex watches, shifting the power dynamics in his favor.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And so I think this idea is really, really important. I'm going to read a summary of this entire section to you. He also realized that he would get better orders and more control over the wholesale price of his watches if he could build up demand so that customers would go in the shop and ask for an Insist on a Rolex watch by name by his branding and advertising campaigns. Hans effectively turned the tables on the retailers no longer would he have to approach retailers and ask them to stock his watches customers would demand Rolex branded watches and The retailers would have to come to him. So as you already know, I'm obsessed by these people that identify handful of principles. They know what's important to their business and they just execute on those principles to repeat them for decades. And that's exactly what Rolex did. That's exactly what Hans did. He had essentially three things that it took him when I'm about to describe to you, just going to take two decades to actually fulfill to the degree that he wanted to. Because remember, he starts his company back in 1905. The first waterproof watch is one of his three tenants is going to happen for 20 years after that. And I think another six years after that, he gets to perpetual. So he has three things that he goes, I want the watches to be precise, which he handles that product that problem first. Number two, I want them to be waterproof. And number three, I want them to be self winding. And so the first thing he does is like, okay, my watch is again, he's a perfectionist. They have to be the best in the world. ([Time 0:30:47](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9834b875-5359-4ecf-9914-8ebda603e394))
    - **Note:** Wants watches to be precise waterproof and self winding. His 3 key tenants for watches. Used social proof to show quality got a certification from a world-class Observatory on the quality of the product. Like one that did space. Was the first to get the certificate makes it clear he’s making the most accurate wrist watch. he is quick to invest in his business and buys inventions quickly he wanted his watch the waterproof and he bought the waterproof pattern almost instantly however, it was filed spent on development and quality. He’s stacking features and quality on top of each other which compound has advantage first he gets a wristwatch with a certificate for its accuracy of movement then buys the pattern so he can make the only waterproof watch to make sure it’s resistant to all outside influences so it will keep its time clear vision and compounding advantage. The fact it was so robust it would never need to be reset no matter heat cold water ect. Making it the highest quality watch ever. Then used this in his marketing pitch. Building a watch system.
- Associating with the Best for Success
  Summary:
  The rise of the Rolex Oyster's fame began with innovative marketing strategies in 1926.
  By creating special window displays and involving a top British actress in advertisements, Rolex associated itself with high prestige. The brand consistently aligned itself with top achievers, like British racer Malcolm Campbell, who wore a Rolex during speed record-breaking achievements.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  This was the first step in the triumphant rise of the fame of the Rolex Oyster. But look at how fast he moves. So this is invented in May 1926. He buys it in July 1926. The next year, he takes advantage of this news event, this, you know, this event that's going to get a ton of idea eyes on it anyways, amplifies his product. That same year in 1927, he goes and creates these window displays and all of the retailers that are now going to sell his watch. And so this is how he describes it. We divide special window displays that which gave the buying public great pleasure. The chief feature was an aquarium with other plants and goldfish and in it was plunged an oyster watch, which was the only watch in the world that was as watertight as an oyster. The same year he gets one of the top British actresses and he starts running ads. The the ad is one of the top British actresses. Her hand is in like a goldfish bowl. So half of her arm is in a tank and then you could see that she's wearing the watch. And so he used this idea over and over again. And one of the things that Rolex does is it's phenomenal. It's like they always associate themselves with the very, very best. So another British guy named Malcolm Campbell, he broke like the land speed record in a car like nine different times. And the last time that he did it, Hans learns that Malcolm Campbell had been wearing a Rolex when he broke the speed record. ([Time 0:38:53](https://share.snipd.com/snip/21a0adaa-2f97-4ab4-83b2-bf10fcebacb2))
    - **Note:** They are always working on creative marketing when someone swims the English channel. They put an oyster around her neck and after 10 hours the time is still perfect. They use this as marketing and roll the wave of the event hype to do product placement. No one ever seen a watcher proof watch they would market it in fish bowls calling it the oyster because it was air tight as an oyster. They associate themselves with greatness when the person who broke the land speed record was using a Rolex they endorsed him. Said when he broke the record he was wearing a Rolex watch. Then gave them away to people like Churchill Eisenhower the first guy to summit Everest had one. He’s placing them at key points with key people to cultivate desire. Associating Rolex with the best only. Marketing genius.
- Innovation Legacy Through Solving Centuries-Old Problems
  Summary:
  Historically, horologists have focused on making or repairing clocks and watches.
  Hans highlighted that waterproofing was a crucial innovation that paved the way for automatic watches. The concept of the waterproof watch was pivotal for the development of the perpetual watch, an automatic or self-winding timepiece.
  Rolex's pioneering work in waterproof watches was essential for the discovery of the perpetual watch, emphasizing the importance of solving age-old challenges for innovation.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  This idea, of course, had preoccupied many famous horologists of the past. I am not a watch guy. I don't own any watches. My wife has a hard enough time getting me to wear a wedding ring. I'm very minimalist, right? So I didn't know what the hell that word was. So I looked it up. All that is is a horologist is just a person or company that makes or repairs clocks and watches. They're also referred to throughout history as a clockmaker. So what Hans is telling us is like, listen, this is not I was in the first person to notice this is a problem. I was the first person to solve it. And I wouldn't have been able to solve it if I didn't solve the waterproofing first. He said the waterproof watch had in itself marked a great step forward towards the realization of this new achievement, an automatic watch can function with the utmost regularity Only if the movement is placed in a waterproof case. What he's telling you is oyster unlock the opportunity for perpetual. It had been my belief that the watch of the future is the perpetual watch. In other words, the automatic or self winding watch in this field to Rolex has been a pioneer without the waterproof watch. The perpetual could never have been discovered. And so I need to repeat that because it's so important without the waterproof watch. The perpetual could never have been discovered. Now, something's also interesting. This is like a centuries old problem. They're going to run a fantastic ad talking about like, but how they solve this this century old problem. And there's a great line that I found in this Rolex ([Time 0:42:29](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8dd1d622-fd45-4524-8132-97abdd799e25))
    - **Note:** Stacking skills to create the automatic watch, it had been wanted for centuries, but it couldn’t be accomplished before there was waterproof and once they had this maker, create a self winding watch the Rolex oyster perpetual first of its kind. People had been trying to do this for so long by making it automatic this opened up, watches to everyone they used to need to be rewound and reset constantly but now you could set it and forget it opened up the market not just a experts, but to anyone hobbiest. He invented a big new invention and created a completely new market through it. Just changing the world through his watch innovation doing what no one thought could be done. They used this as a huge marketing pitch. Constantly stacking innovations with innovative marketing that’s the whole story. Built the industry. He set up a trust to hold Rolex he set up the trust so Rolex could never be sold the business or made public would always be in his vision. They can only be dedicated to world class watches despite his death the company mission and vision is as alive as when he was because of this.
