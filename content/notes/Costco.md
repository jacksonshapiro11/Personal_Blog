- Fedmart: A For-Profit Alternative to Fedco
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And so very specifically, we are not talking about what Costco is today as a wholesaler. Fedmart is not big pallets with enormous quantities of things. It is much more like a Walmart. You want to go grab a can of beans off the shelf, you grab a can of beans off the shelf. And importantly, it is both packaged food and sundries or general merchandise under one roof. Yes, correct.
  Speaker 2
  And on the one hand, Fedmart is obviously a clone of Fedco. On the other hand, the huge single key difference that makes all the difference. It's a for profit company. It's not a nonprofit. And so just like all capitalist for profit companies, Saul and the jewelry guys and Fedmart have the impetus to expand.
  Speaker 1
  That makes sense. And so just to put some other fine points around what it is and what it isn't, it is still only for federal employees, right?
  Speaker 2
  Yes, at this time.
  Speaker 1
  Okay. And it's not a membership club.
  Speaker 2
  Well, so it is still a membership club. You do still have to be a federal employee. You do still have to buy a membership. ([Time 0:21:32](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a68bf4d7-843c-4518-9dd3-24191f54da54))
    - **Note:** Sol price founds fedmart off the idea of fed co this is the fundamental beginning of low cost retailing. He first invents the discount store. Manufacturers set a global minimum price which stores could sell at and sol gets around this with the membership so he isn’t selling ti the public. This is an instant success and they expand quickly in locations and product offering. 4 business tenants provide the best value to customers pay employees well and give good benefits. Maintain his est business practices and make money for investors. Costco and fed Mart didn’t have loss leaders which is basically taking a loss on some things to get people in then you need to underhandedly upcharge other things. They also pay 26 vs 19.50 an hour vs Walmart with great benefits they’d turn over is 7% vs 40% and they save money net net on the ramp and training time. Pretty much everyone at Costco loves it it has negligible lost inventory and people work there for decades jim start as a bagger there.
- The Founders' Angle: Exploiting an Underappreciated Division
  Key takeaways:
  - Morris Chang was the founder and CEO of TSMC, who was booted out of Texas Instruments at age 56.
  - Saul and Robert start TSMC immediately after being booted out and lease an office.
  - They decide not to directly compete with failing Fedmart.
  - Saul and Robert focus on the underappreciated centralized warehousing division at Fedmart.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Totally amazing. I love that. He's like the Morris Chang of American retail. Yes. Morris Chang, of course, being the founder and CEO of TSMC who was booted out of Texas Instruments at age 56, I think. Something like that. Yeah. And then we go on to start TSMC. So Saul and Robert together, they get a lease on an office literally the next day after they're booted out and they're like, we're doing it again. We're back in the saddle. Let's go. But they know they're not going to compete directly with Fedmart because Fedmart is failing at that. They're going to get steamrolled by Walmart and Kmart and Target and everybody else.
  Speaker 1
  By the way, Fedmart within five years was like completely dead after this acquisition. Totally ran into the ground. And Hugo Man did make a fortune on the real estate, but yeah, Fedmart's dead. Yep.
  Speaker 2
  So Saul and Robert are sitting around in their new office, brainstorming what's their angle of attack here. And they keep coming back to one part of the Fedmart business that they felt was underappreciated and they didn't really exploit enough while they were at Fedmart. And that is the division that Jim Senegal ran, the centralized warehousing operations. So the two of them are like, you know, if we zoom out, there really is kind of a different and orthogonal way to think about the Fedmart business. ([Time 0:42:37](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d5258bad-451d-4a55-aab4-8a54f3a8e0a4))
    - **Note:** Sol was a great operator but bad deal maker. He tries to tap financing but ends up selling equity giving up control and getting kicked out of his own company. The acquirer wanted the real estate and the company died. They open another chain called price club which optimizes on the warehouse concept only markets to businesses not consumers and holds berth few skus. Kept it very simple. They accidentally market ti consumers and had been struggling a bit and this is where they take off. Costco has such a high turnover and great warehouse dynamics they cash flow well. Suppliers do their logistics invoice 30 days and they turn inventory 12.4x a year. People love the warehouse model because they love low prices above all. Negative cash conversion cycle by the nature of the business. Warehouse model is really efficient and low skus. Sol influences Walmart Home Depot ect. Sol was very open with his knowledge and Jim sinegal got asked by a guy cloning price club if he wanted to be the ceo this became Costco. Eventually price club and Costco merge.
- How Costco Provides Insane Value to Consumers with Low Markups
  Key takeaways:
  - The typical Costco consumer has a higher income and education level compared to Walmart and the US median.
  - Costco shoppers are smart consumers who know they are getting a good deal.
  - The upfront membership fee encourages members to maximize their discounts.
  - Membership reduces shrinkage and creates a sense of belonging.
  - Costco enforces a strict cap on margins to provide the best value to consumers.
  - Costco's markup is significantly lower than other retailers.
  - Member trust is crucial to Costco's success and differentiation in the market.
  - Costco has maintained its extreme value proposition for 40 years.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And so I looked into some of the data on this to try and put some numbers to it. There was an independent research firm that found that the typical Costco consumer makes about $125,000 in household income and has a four year degree. Walmart by comparison has a median income of about $80,000. And keep in mind, the median US income is $71,000. So Costco shoppers have a 70% higher income than the US median.
  Speaker 2
  Yeah. This is one of the most surprising things about Costco. They have the lowest prices, but they have the wealthiest consumers of any major retailer.
  Speaker 1
  Yes, it's totally fascinating and very smart consumers. People who can kind of look at the deal and go, actually, I know I'm coming out ahead on this. Another interesting psychology around this is when you pay $60 upfront, it encourages you to come and use the membership. You are more likely to shop because you've prepaid some of your margin dollars.
  Speaker 2
  I think this is called the endowment effect.
  Speaker 1
  If I remember back to my psychology classes, yes, you just sort of assume that you're getting some kind of good deal by prepaying for a membership upfront. So you want to go maximize the margin dollars that you're able to get on their discounts, which is totally fascinating. Another one is that membership further decreases shrinkage. We already talked about the fact that employee retention is great for making sure people don't steal things. So this membership makes it so members don't want to lose their membership. You sort of feel like you're part of some sort of club. On top of that, these items are huge. They're hard to steal. How do you steal a TV? How do you steal a two and a half pound thing of nuts? And so there's like all these factors, membership is one of them that really contribute to low shrinkage.
  Speaker 2
  Yes. Now, you mentioned getting a good deal. We talked earlier back in the Fedmar days about how loss leaders and sales was kind of an anathema to solve praise. How does that play into this?
  Speaker 1
  Yes. This is super interesting. So Costco basically wants to provide insane value to consumers. They want you to get a better deal as a member than you could possibly get by shopping anywhere else. And so how do they go about doing this? They have enforced a strict cap on the margin that they are willing to make on any product. So they have decided internally that they are not allowed to mark up anything more than 14% above what these suppliers sell it to them for. And I'll tell you, they are tough, but fair with their suppliers in making sure that they get a great price for their members. And so Costco decides we will only mark up anything a maximum of 14%. They actually do mark other things up less than that because things like electronics, they actually can only mark up 6, 7, 8%. So maximum 14%. The only exception to this is Kirkland signature where they cheat a little bit and let themselves go up to 15%, quite indulgent. So how does this compare? I think that's the interesting thing here. A common practice at department stores is literally 100% markup. Someone gets a good for 50 bucks. They sell it for 100 bucks. I mean, even at Walmart, a discounter, quote, unquote, marks up 25%, which is almost twice as much as Costco's margin. And so Jim Senegal has a great quote on this. He was asked about it. And his response was, you could raise the price of a bottle of ketchup to a dollar and three cents instead of $1 and no one would know. Raising prices just 3% would add 50% to our pre-tax income. Why not do it? It's like heroin. You do it a little bit and you want a little more. Raising prices is the easy way.
  Speaker 2
  Well, and I think also back to the membership, it all comes back to member trust. The members have to trust that they are going to get the absolute best price on everything and that Costco isn't going to be playing these games. Otherwise, they would just go shop at Amazon or Walmart or wherever.
  Speaker 1
  You're exactly right. The value proposition 40 years ago was you are going to get the very best deal possible on the goods that you're buying here. Extreme value proposition is what they like to say. And the fact that they've just made that true every year for 40 years is something that really does stick in people's psyche. ([Time 1:20:13](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c041faca-0788-4789-9f2d-182e621d0c04))
    - **Note:** The average Costco shopper is highly educated and the brand promise is very clear. They can’t raise prices even though they could because of their brand promise. It’s easy to cheat and make a bigger margin but then you destroy everything. Costco shoppers know the market so we’ll they can talk with and jot down why prices went up or down so when that factor reverses they can go back and make their case. This is because they have deep industry knowledge and few skus. Kirkland signature is the most popular brand in the world and Costco founded it because they believed they could make products either better cheaper or both vs the current market alternatives creating trust. The bet is you take selection but you promise quality. Making intentional trade offs they limit skus but the amount they save on only selling 8 oz nuts vs 3 and 8 oz makes up for the loss in sales. Membership fees make up 70% of margins that come from 4 bn of top line vs 30% from 230bn of top line. They have an executive membership which finds cash back to the highest spending members they reward their best customers and refund you if you don’t use it. Retention rate 93% they want to go out of their way to reward their best users instead of extracting from them and this keeps the flywheel going. They have great deals with credit card companies because they proved they could exist without them so they got good deals instead of the 3% tax that would sink their business. Do the hard thing first.
- The Evolution of a Retail Giant: Growth, Trade Offs, and Culture
  Key takeaways:
  - The credit card companies eat all your profitability if you let them in the door.
  - Costco's payment processing playbook is essential for their success.
  - Costco's business model remained unchanged for decades, leading to consistent growth.
  - Costco operates in the global retail market, being the third biggest player in the US.
  - Costco's success is attributed to intelligent trade-offs and hard work over a long period of time.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  It actually would flip the business upside down. We talked about it a minute ago. They make what, $7.5 billion of operating income on $230 billion of sales. The credit card companies eat all your profitability if you let them in the door. And so it's a pretty incredible position, toughing it out and doing the hard thing first and then being able to flip to the other side of the table. Anyway, I love that point on the payment processing. I think it's an amazing playbook that Costco ran over the years and a necessary one. Every single time Costco does something amazing, they needed to because of the trade offs that they chose.
  Speaker 2
  Yep. So I think that's the last big piece. Let's take it to the business today.
  Speaker 1
  Definitely. So, David, to your point, we talked about very few things between, to be honest, like the late 80s and today. And it's because the model was basically cast in stone. I mean, they added things like gas. They added ancillary services and you can go get glasses and you can go buy diamond rings. And maybe some of that was done earlier. I think a lot of that was from the FedMart days. Big yard goods. I bought a shed there. But the story is intentionally boring. It's, what if you grow at 10% for decades doing exactly the same thing, having a well-understood set of trade offs and a strong culture? Where does it go?
  Speaker 2
  Yep. And you operate in arguably the second or maybe third biggest market in the world, which is global retail.
  Speaker 1
  Right. And you're the third biggest player in the largest market, you know, America behind Amazon and Walmart. So this acquired episode is different because so much of it is just nerding out over the awesome nuances of Costco's business model and actually less of, and then this crazy thing happened because it was a bunch of like stand up guys making an intelligent set of trade offs really thinking hard and then a whole bunch of people working hard for a long time. That's the story. ([Time 2:00:57](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e0f3abd1-9e9d-4711-b2d3-cff5c043ddab))
    - **Note:** This is a story of a great business model that got compounded for years with little change in a big market. 25% of skus are treasure hunt items they make coming to stores an event. Costco is scale economies shared with customers which is a massive moat. Costco has intentionally and maybe unintentionally a bit counter positioned against e-commerce because their whole business is you pay less but you come to the warehouse ect. Then they sell more things. They have a lot of latent power. Keep it simple and just stick to the plan. Don’t raise skus don’t do e-commerce just do something simple. They don’t think in dollars everyone thinks in cents. Deep commitment to the business plan. Instead of being these crazy tech shoot the moon people they’re just a what happens if we work hard and stay consistent for years. They talk to talk and walked the walk on their values and they get away with it because they’ve been so successful they can get away with it but also their success is their culture so it’s chicken and egg. Both their ceos started as baggers at fed mart.
