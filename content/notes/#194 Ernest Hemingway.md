### Highlights

- He’s very individualistic and thinks for himself. Lives in the keys. Views the world through his lense and writes for the people not the critics. Experienced so much in his life. He was watching d day from a boat. He was a world spy lived everywhere. Unique and different person. Developed his own style transcended literature. Modern day forest gump. Willing to put himself into harms way because he saw war gave unique answers and he wanted to be the best. Almost dies many times. He’s constantly experiencing new things and these varied experiences are what informs his literature. Avoid intense ideology doesn’t help you in the long run. He was an ego manic and didn’t think the rules applied to him. He makes personal and professional sacrifices to hold up the integrity of his work. When he left war he slept well every night but when he was home and safe his life felt purposeless and he couldn’t sleep. Very disciplined. Would wake up early write for 5-7 hours then live his life normally. Dedicated good system. Loved getting out of his mind and into his body.

  How many times he was within inches or minutes of death, even when they said he was, by the time he was like 19 or 20, he was an injured, he got injured in World War I. He was an ambulance driver for the Red Cross. And they wound up getting shelled by, I think, German artillery. I can't remember. It was Germans definitely shot at him.

  Commented in a letter that he was like an animal with his manuscript, keeping it close to him or hiding it in a drawer under other papers. He never willingly showed it to anyone and would not talk about it. So let's go back to that.

  Sent an acceptance speech that was a dark reflection on his life's work. This is Hemingway. Writing at its best is a lonely life. The writer grows in public stature as he sheds his loneliness and often his work deteriorates. But he should always strive to create something that has never been done or that others have tried and failed. And then we go into like this decline of his physical health and compounded with depression. The accident on his boat in 1950 was more serious than he left on. He got a concussion. He fell on like a gaff, which is like this big hook to like stab fish to death, I guess is what it's used for. And winds up like getting a concussion. And then he had like swelling in his spine. So he was more serious than he let on. And it was coming after at least two serious concussions in World War Two. In January 1954, he survived. This is unbelievable. So he goes to Africa again. He's all over the world. In January 1954, he survived two plane crashes in Africa during a 24 hour period. First, the sightseeing flight that he chartered crash-landed in dense brush in Uganda. Hemingway suffered a mild concussion. Then the rescue plane that came for him the next day inexplicably crashed and burned on takeoff. To escape, Hemingway literally butted the door open with his head. Seriously compounding the earlier injury, credited for saving the lives of other people on board, there was a rupture of kidneys, a collapse of his intestines, severe injuries to The liver, major concussions, several burns to legs, belly, right forearm, left hand, his head, and his lips. He also dislocated his right arm and his shoulder. Hemingway would never fully recover from these injuries. It marked the start of an irreversible downward spiral, one that was aggravated by various other illnesses and a deep depression. The thought that his work was deteriorating kept him up for more than one night. So now he's only injured. There's a slow multiple year realization that, OK, I cannot stay in Cuba, a place that he loved. And so it says that this is his schedule right before Castro. At least until 1957, Cuba was Hemingway's safe haven. So it says he could settle back into the film routine at Tafinka that had nourished the body and spirit in his past. He would still write in the morning, then he would swim in the pool after lunch, and then take his boat into the stream to troll for marlin. If the weather was rough and the fish weren't biting, there was still shooting at his club or the occasional cockfight in the village. In the evening, he would linger over dinner with longtime Cuban friends who drop by almost every day. So he really relished. He enjoyed it was his favorite place in the world. He did not want to give it up. And slowly but surely he's getting intertwined. Batista sends guards multiple times to his house. And this is like, this is how John Wick starts. You don't bring people to your side by killing their dog. And so he had a bunch of drunk soldiers show up one time. This is right before Castro is going to throw out Batista. And he just, there's just, it's silliness. They come by, they're saying, oh, you know, we've heard, they basically say, you know, we hear there's like a rebel soldier or an oppositionist that are here. So Hemingway opens the door. He's like, what do you want? They're reeking up alcohol. And he's like, listen, there's no oppositionist here. There's no revolutionaries on his property. And he's like, you guys got to get out of here. And so they wind up not even searching his house. They went up turning around and leaving. And the next morning, his dog Machikos was found dead with a head wound. And they start coming to his property because he's got people coming from all over, like all over the world to come visit him. Remember, he's super famous at this point. And ([Time 1:08:24](https://share.snipd.com/snip/bbb54662-9a05-4788-b5da-d58a89844a26))
