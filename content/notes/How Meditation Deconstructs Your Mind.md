- Category: #articles

- Summary: Meditation can be understood through a new scientific model that outlines four stages: focused attention, open-monitoring, non-dual, and cessation. This framework helps explain how meditation calms the mind and potentially leads to deeper insights and experiences. By recognizing these stages, individuals can better tailor their meditation practices to achieve their desired outcomes.

### Highlights

- Let’s start with plain language. Think of meditation as having four stages of depth, each with a corresponding style of practice: focused attention, open-monitoring, non-dual, and cessation.
  Near the surface,“focused attention” practices help settle the mind. By default, our minds are usually snow globes in constant frenzy. Our attention constantly jumps from one flittering speck to the next, and the storm of activity blocks our view of the whole sphere. By focusing attention on an object — the breath, repeating a mantra, the back of your thigh, how a movement feels in the body — we can train the mind to stop getting yanked around. With the mind settled on just one thing, it’s easier to see through the storm.
  “Open-monitoring” practices help us get untangled from focusing on any particular thing happening in the mind, opening the aperture of our attention to notice the wider field of awareness that all those thoughts, feelings, and ideas all arise and fall within.
  Once you’ve settled the mind and gotten acquainted with the more spacious awareness beneath it, “non-dual” practices help you shift your mental center of gravity so that you identify with that expansive field of awareness itself, rather than everything that arises within it, as we normally do. (I know this probably sounds weird, we’ll get more into it later. Some things in meditation are irreducibly weird, which is part of what makes me think it’s worth paying attention to.)
  And finally, for practitioners with serious meditation chops, you can go one step deeper, where even the field of non-dual awareness disappears. If you sink deep enough into the mind, you’ll find that it just extinguishes, like a candle flame blown out by a sudden gust of wind. That can happen for seconds at a time, called nirodhas in Theravada Buddhism, or it can last for days at a time, called nirodha-sammapati, or cessation attainment.

  You can think of this progression as four rungs on a ladder that lead from the surface of the mind all the way down to the bottom. Or, from the beginner stages of meditation, all the way through to the very advanced. You can place a huge variety of meditative practices — though not all — somewhere along this spectrum.
  And just about everything that’s grown popular under the label of mindfulness is in that first group of focused-attention practices. The idea that meditation can make you “[10 percent happier](https://www.meditatehappier.com/podcast)” is talking about these introductory practices that settle the mind.
  But the idea that meditation can make you 10 times happier, like meditation teacher Shinzen Young [claims](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P7q2MW5upg), references the next stages: practices that open up once the mind begins to settle.

    - **Note:** 4 stages of meditation its about quieting the mind and tapping into a deeper consciousness
- the general theory of meditation. The key to this framework is a theory that’s risen to dominate cognitive science in the past decade or so: [predictive processing](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13164-022-00666-6).
  Predictive processing says that we don’t experience the world as it *is*, but as we *predict* it to be. Our conscious experience [is a construction](http://slehar.com/wwwRel//cartoonepist/cartoonepist.html) of layered mental habits acquired through past experiences. We don’t see the world through our eye sockets; we don’t hear the world through our ear canals. These all feed information into our brains, which conjure our experience of the world from scratch — like when we dream — only that in waking consciousness, they’re at least trying to match what they whip up in our experience to what might actually be going on in the world outside our skulls.

    - **Note:** meditation deconstructs the predictive mind and rewrites the bias inherent in our models we rewrite our stories. Reprogram our minds. Deconstruction then rewrite the stories
- That’s why during the open-monitoring stage, you begin to see the entire snow globe that mental activity is happening inside of. The idea of a “field” of awareness is no longer a metaphor; you can see it directly.
  “Advanced practitioners are said to be able to effortlessly observe experience as a whole,” [write](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014976342100261X#bib0025) Laukkonen and Slagter, without being ‘caught’ by thoughts, emotions, or anything else that arises in one’s sensorium.”
  Focused attention practices are an important step in meditation — it helps to calm your mind before trying to see through it. But on their own, they don’t usually lead to big revelations about how your mind works. Open monitoring is where this “seeing through” process really kicks in.
  “There is a space of awareness that’s different from the contents of awareness,” said Chandaria, who’s been meditating for about 37 years. “And that’s something that most people aren’t even aware of. The first time we see that, it’s like, oh, I never knew that there was actually an ocean on which these waves were arising. I never knew the ocean.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jj2k32wz50syqwk55940cns1))
    - **Note:** monitoring awareness
- For example, in open-monitoring practice, it probably still feels like there’s a “you” doing the meditating. And that “you” is experiencing “your” awareness. There’s a subject — you — aware of an object, the field of experience.
  But according to [heaps of meditators and mystics](https://www.amazon.com/Perennial-Philosophy-Aldous-Huxley/dp/0061724947) through the millennia, this, too, can be deconstructed.
  Non-dual meditation aims at turning down even those deep priors that construct distinctions between subject and object altogether. As well as basically every other possible distinction. During [non-dual experiences](https://digitalcommons.ciis.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1031&context=conscjournal), there’s no self/other, good/bad, here/there, now/later. All these dualities that underlie ordinary cognition basically melt into a big soup of the Now. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jj2k5pve2yntbb6dqh4jbhaj))
    - **Note:** deconstruct the mind
- the whole show of consciousness can be extinguished — temporarily, that is — altogether.
  Nirodha-samāpatti, or “cessation of thought and feeling,” is a summit of [meditative attainment](https://academic.oup.com/jaar/article-abstract/XLV/2/226/832348) in Theravada Buddhism, the oldest surviving form of Buddhism most commonly practiced in Southeast Asia. Cessation is like going under general anesthesia, but without any drugs. Consciousness can be [switched off](https://psyche.co/ideas/what-happens-to-the-brain-during-consciousness-ending-meditation) from the inside, for — according to the scriptures — up to seven days at a time (though the first [lab data](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0079612322001984?via%3Dihub) on cessation looked at a more modest 90-minute stretch).
  Cessation is a bonafide advanced meditation thing — I’ll make zero effort to convince you it’s accessible to us non-monastic folks. But [according](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/advanced-meditation-alters-consciousness-and-our-basic-sense-of-self/) to neuroscientist Matthew Sacchet, who leads the Meditation Research Program at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital, the early data collected from studying cessations with neuroscience gizmos supports the idea that meditation deconstructs the predictive mind.
  “Cessation could thus reflect a final release of the expectation to be aware or alert,” Luakkonen and Slagter [write](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0079612322001984?via%3Dihub). It’s like a bottoming-out of the predictive mind.
  Coming out of cessation, meditators can observe the reconstruction of the predictive mind, prior by prior. “That puts us in a special state,” Chandaria said. “You can call it reprogramming mode. And in reprogramming mode, we can start to reprogram ourselves in ways that could be more conducive to human flourishing.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jj2kncb4ds4az3jhgwzqtk1k))
    - **Note:** extinguish consciousness to put it back together
