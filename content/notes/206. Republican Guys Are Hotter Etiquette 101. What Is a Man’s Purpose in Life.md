  And it's incredible because my alfalfa is, well yes listen to the episode, but unlock that I had seeing the outpouring of what that did for people to hear somebody express honesty in A genuine way, in a vulnerable way, to be seen. You know, so many people came out and were like, essentially saying something along the lines of like, I've been through something similar. And it meant so much to me to hear your version of that. And here's my version of that. And it's something Brene Brown has focused her work around, is that vulnerability is a gift for other people. It opens the room, and it equalizes us to the human experience. And so I think my real alfalfa is like, if you've ever been in a room where anybody gets vulnerable, you notice that immediately it gives permission for other people to become a little Bit vulnerable and share and go like, yeah, I lost somebody too in that way, or I went through this in that way. It just creates such a more honest conversation and connection between people. So it taught me that we have, it showed me that first of all the community that we've created is just, it's incredible. It's truly incredible. ([Time 0:09:18](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ada2b589-8208-476a-8c81-6a3b3d38095c))

- Understanding Attachment Styles: The Spectrum of Relationships
  Summary:
  Anxious attachment style individuals often fear abandonment, crave closeness, and are highly sensitive to rejection, which can lead to dependency and clinginess.
  They may struggle with jealousy and seek constant reassurance from their partners. In contrast, those with an avoidant attachment style prioritize independence and can avoid emotional closeness due to fears of vulnerability, potentially appearing distant or emotionally unavailable.
  Secure individuals maintain a healthy balance, feeling comfortable with intimacy and independence while effortlessly communicating their feelings.
  Lastly, fearful avoidant individuals experience a mix of anxious and avoidant tendencies, desiring closeness but fearing rejection, leading to erratic behavior in relationships characterized by emotional highs and lows.
  This understanding of attachment styles illustrates a spectrum, with varying degrees of traits influencing interpersonal dynamics.

  I don't know that I'm avoiding okay well let's see I might be anxious so Armand characteristics individuals with the anxious attachment style often worry about their relationships And fear abandonment they may crave clos intimacy, but are also highly sensitive to any signs of rejection or neglect. They may become overly dependent on their partners for validation, the way it affects their relationships. Anxiously attached individuals may come across as needy or clingy. They may struggle with jealousy and constantly seek reassurance from their partners. Okay, avoidance. Avoidance. This is not great. People with it.
  Speaker 1
  By the way, neither is anxious and neither of them are great or would anybody want to be.
  Speaker 2
  No, no. They're all, they're secure, anxious, avoidant, and fearful avoidance. And they're not like, they all, this theory stems from your childhood. It's not like you really had a decision about... That's how your parents treated you exactly. Exactly. It's just that's it.
  Speaker 4
  All right. So the three of us are your fault. Yeah. This from the book attached. That's a great book.
  Speaker 2
  I got it through expensive therapy. But you could have just bought that book. I just think it's thanks to people with an avoidant attachment style tend to prioritize independence and self-sufficiency. They often avoid close relationships because they fear losing their autonomy or being vulnerable. They may suppress their emotions and avoid situations that require emotional closeness. The way it affects their relationships. Avoidantly attached individuals may seem distant or emotionally available in relationships they may struggle with intimacy may be uncomfortable with depending on others. I'm not that like me at all.
  Speaker 1
  I don't think any of us are either one of those 100% right? That's a spectrum. You borrow from me.
  Speaker 3
  I'm describing a spectrum. I'm looking around. I might say they've called me and asked me to do like a photo shoot.
  Speaker 4
  They're like a avoidant attachment style magazine is Like winning Steven down just not looking at the camera. Yeah, also not like directly addressing the camera. I don't need you. What's the other one? Because I'm not either of those two. Well, there is a there is this anchor here secure, which I think you are mostly you check me as a secure guy. I think but I'm introverted. That's the that's the that's another axis.
  Speaker 1
  I would describe you as like you're in that secure but like more on the avoidance side and I think I'm more on the anxious side but also have secure tendencies as well but have had anxious Tendencies.
  Speaker 2
  So those people feel comfortable with intimacy and independence. They trust others and believe they are worthy of love and support. They can easily form close relationships and are generally open about their feelings. Securely attached individuals are comfortable with both closeness and autonomy in relationships. They are able to maintain healthy boundaries and communicate effectively with their partners. The last one might as well go through it. Fearful avoidant is a mix of anxious and avoidant tendencies. Individuals with a fearful avoidant may desire close relationships but simultaneously feel fear, fear getting hurt. They may have a deep seated fear of rejection leading to conflicting behaviors where they push others away while also longing for closeness. Fearful, avoidant individuals often experience inner turmoil in relationships. They may have intense emotional highs and lows making their relationships unstable and unpredictable That likely wouldn't be any of us because we just would be tough to be friends
  Speaker 3
  With someone like that I didn't even know there was that additional level.
  Speaker 2
  No fourth is It's like this. ([Time 1:48:29](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4ea9ae3e-6456-4edd-9df6-e66e75337614))

- Unlock Your Highest Potential
  Summary:
  Focusing on the spiritual aspect of purpose reveals the dual nature of existence as both physical and transcendent.
  Life can be perceived as a series of self-indulgent actions or as a journey to uncover deeper meaning through personal growth. Individuals are encouraged to view life from a spiritual perspective, acknowledging an eternal soul that has undergone multiple lifetimes of learning and growth.
  The goal is to confront and overcome self-imposed barriers—such as trauma, societal expectations, and familial limitations—allowing one to tap into their highest potential.
  This pursuit involves exploring capabilities across physical, emotional, and mental dimensions, akin to testing one's strength or resilience.
  By striving to fully understand and experience one's own potential, individuals can appreciate the miracle of their existence, ultimately realizing that true fulfillment lies in the journey of self-discovery and reaching for the fullest expression of self.

  So I think what's most important is the spiritual aspect of purpose. So of course there's a physical manifestation, of course there's you know that which is super important like how the planet looks and feels by the time we're here and gone. But I think like on a very individual level but it's also a cosmic and collective level. Who I am while I'm here, like so many people view life as this. You can view it as like, I'm just here to pleasure myself and consume and make all the mistakes and do all the things because that's it. There's just like one life. But I think a lot of like people that view life through a spiritual lens realize that maybe they've been doing this forever. Maybe they have had different instances of life in a physical manifestation for all eternity. And this is a dream. And I have a soul. And my job is to to work through all of the different traumas and pains and manifesting, and karmas that are embodied in myself, and really exercise myself to my highest being. Like when I really personally think about, what am I to do, it's what is my absolute 100% potential and if I was to remove all the barriers, which those barriers are usually self-manifested, Physically manifested, family manifested, trauma manifested, what your parents told you you could be, what society tells you you could be, and then there's just like your hundred Percent potential of everything you could ever be, and how far can I get in that journey of just like exercising and witnessing the miracle of what it means to be me? And that's it, and that's what I'm here to do. I'm here to experience, you know, Socrates has that quote that I think floated around on Twitter a lot. It was just like, or Instagram, it was like, it's a shame to not know what your body is capable of, for example, to like fully feel your masculine self at your highest form and like fully Know what you're physically capable of. How big of a rock can you lift? What are you really capable of? You're going to die. Do you want to know what you're capable of? Physically, emotionally, mentally? I do. I do. I think it's important. And I think that purpose could come down to just simply knowing that you exercised to the highest fulfillment. That's interesting.
  Speaker 2
  I mean on the physical level it's quite easy to like measure yourself on that but like do you ever guys get this like a little bit of angst where you're like there's a different path. What could have been. Yeah it's like more what could have been. I was like okay like if I'm capable of this maybe I'm capable of like five times more of that. Maybe I was, maybe I'm more capable to run this type of business, or maybe not run a business, like go into science and not care about, you know.
