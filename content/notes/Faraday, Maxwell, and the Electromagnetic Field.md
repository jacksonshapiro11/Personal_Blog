### Highlights

- Faraday was an experimenter who came up with the concept that would create the paradigm for the field of physics and Maxwell and theoretician did grueling experiments to prove the ideas faraday believed through his life of experimenting. Both men were not appreciated in their day as the world wasn’t ready for their ideas and rejected them not until Einstein formalized their ideas did the world truly understand how ahead of their time and important their discoveries were. The ideas of electro magnetic fields from the previous view bodies in space created the ideas of electrons and relativity. Created the idea of the electromagnetic field
    - **Note:** Faraday was a hands on creator and maxwell was more scientific and theoretical. Their combined work created a field ahead of its time.
- Quit a well paying high status job to do what he loved and thought was interesting to him Oliver heavyside

    - **Note:** Move in from hardship don’t dwell on wins or loses.
- People had been using models with only things they can see maxwell showed some things happen at a scale where it can’t even be perceived so it cannot be described with diagrams but with equations

    - **Note:** A key moment in the science of electricity is when maxwell started explaining things and making predictions about specific things he couldn’t see. This is key to all science. The idea of little charged particles was incredibly low probability with great reach. This is a massive moment in science kinda when science begun in many ways
- Through thinking and experimentation he discovered the fundamental laws of electricity and magnetism. He built simplified mathematical models of these things called and also for to the root of the issue reading the ancients not just interpretations was u afraid to defy common wisdom and think for himself outside the box. Labor it not thought it’s easier to remember a formula than master a principal
- Thinking fir yourself is important learning the first principles then you thinking from there. Used old known methods to do something so profound no one else could even venture a guess. Wide array for knowledge and first principle thinking

    - **Note:** First learn the principles and deeply understand them this gives you the ability to transcend the paradigms but you need to understanding the system from within and without. This is literally the same as Donnella meadows largest leverage point.
      Writing on transcending paradigms and talent vs genius and building your knowledge or paradigms and fundamentals to then apply them. Learn at lower then higher levels of the stack then apply creativity
- Had his own strong beliefs voracious reader and experimenter. Believed in relationships as important for governing things but viewed problems from all sides. One key mental model but uses them all

- Maxwell grew up wealthy but always asked questions wanted ti know how the world worked. Always working with his hands investigating things for himself and wanting to get to the root cause of things. For most of human history most of the advances were provided by practitioners rather than scientists

    - **Note:** Maxwell grew up rich, but was incredibly curious and committed his life to science. In the old days, things were discovered by doers not thinkers like scientist.
- Faraday came up with a theory that in 50-100 years would lay the groundwork for physics but because of his background and perception and the trusty crazy nature of the assertion that all matters met at competing lines of force it was rejected by the establishment. You can be right but sometimes the world needs to be ready don’t place too much credence in the thoughts of the mob they’re often wrong. Faraday used experimental results to prove his lines of force idea to himself but the rest of the field was worried about proving prevailing theories not finding the truth faraday was willing to change his mind when the field was unwilling to even consider doing so. Looked through the data did experiments broke it down to the first principals and things didn’t add up so he reasoned a theory that made sense

    - **Note:** Faraday was willing to change his mind when the field wasn’t. Progress happens one death at a time and some people aren’t willing to question their most fundamental assumptions. He made crazy claims that revolutionized the field but he was there at the wrong place and time. He knew his craft so well that when he broke it down his answer was obvious but other less educated versed people didn’t understand it.
- Sustained imaginative through and strong experimental skill desire to not accept things you can’t see proof of

- I could trust a fact but hard to investigate an assertion. Two men had different paths but came together for this founding. Barbell reading with current discourse continuously learn. Explore observe experiment eliminate error compare findings with theory keep iterating and thinking and firm whatever conclusions show from the experiment dint become a prisoner of your ideas. Through his note taking he provided a product to society and someone gave him a ticket to go to the lectures as a result of his hard work and diligence. Instead of just taking notes he went home and repeated all the experiments that had been done for himself learning by doing. Worked hard kept trying to push for the opportunity and through hard work and grit he got a shot that he took with both hands after waiting and biding his time for many years

    - **Note:** Maxwell (I think) grew up poor but both were creative and didnt just read but owned ideas. They sought to be EV positive and produce a product through his note taking. He pushed for every opportunity and was successful because of his hard work and grit. lifelong lerning with truth seeking not validation of ideas. He didn’t take things at face value but did the work for himself.
- United electricity magnetism and light into one compact theory through the conceit of the electromagnetic field. Faraday came up with the theory and maxwell then developed it further with hertzs experiments validating it despise most scientists being skeptical

    - **Note:** Any great discovery takes a ton of coordination and cooperation.
