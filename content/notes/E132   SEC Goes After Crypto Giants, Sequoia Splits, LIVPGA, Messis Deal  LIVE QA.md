### Highlights

- Balancing rationality and irrationality in venture investing
  Summary:
  Most companies aren't going to work and most people are a little afraid of the decisions they need to make. You probably want to be more rational than unrational irrational But as a venture investor, I think you want to be irrational but also very judgmental.

  Speaker 1
  Policies really should play a role I think you just kind of got to go for it and if it's going to win, it's going to win big And if it doesn't you lose one extra money I think like where you want conservative economic and rational thinking is when you go to the extreme other end Which is just like the large-scale decisions that affect The economic vibrancy of the country in which you live And they're on the margins. You probably want to be more rational than unrational irrational But as a venture investor, I think you want to be irrational But I also think you have to be very judgmental And the reality is that most companies aren't going to work and most people This may seem controversial most people Actually when push comes to shove are a little afraid of the decisions they need to make to be truly successful They're not willing to fire the people that they need to fire They're not willing to be extreme in the product they want to build. They're not willing to price it They're not willing to go to market in an extreme way And it tends to be that these companies fail because of that a lack of courage a lack of conviction I want to say it's a lack of courage or conviction because that that's a very heightened word I just think that when push comes to shove most people implode with the pressure of making a very very hard decision Hmm interesting.
  Speaker 5
  All right in my experience. ([Time 1:13:12](https://share.snipd.com/snip/11eda2fa-d52b-48fc-bab0-80f72cbf1aae))
    - **Note:** When push comes to shove people get scared. You need to do the opposite and get bold in the valley of death. Unwilling to make massive sacrifices to win.
