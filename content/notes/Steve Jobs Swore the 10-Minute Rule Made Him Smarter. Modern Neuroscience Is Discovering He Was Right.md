- Summary: Steve Jobs believed that taking a walk helped him think better when faced with tough problems. Neuroscientists now support this idea, suggesting the "10-minute rule" â€” if you can't solve a problem in 10 minutes, it's better to walk away and walk. Walking allows your mind to relax and explore new solutions instead of getting stuck on one idea.

### Highlights

- Taking a walk "keeps you in the right alert mental state, so you don't just drift off, you don't just fall asleep, or feel lethargic, or [look] at your phone. But at the same time, it keeps your attention moving, because your surroundings are moving while you walk, so your attention can't really fix on anything. So it drifts into your head and explores your problems and tries to solve them from different avenues," she says.
  Walking nudges you to think about many new things. But it also blocks you from [thinking obsessively](https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/ethan-kross-chatter-distanced-self-talk.html) about any single idea.
  "You can't ruminate, because your attention can't stick to one problem for too long because you also have to pay attention to where you're walking," Storoni continues.
  When you go for a walk, you physically move through the landscape, paying light attention to your surroundings so you don't crash into a streetlight or fall in a pothole. Which encourages your mind to pay light attention to various thoughts and ideas passing through it, too. And that, it turns out, is the ideal mental state for coming up with [new ideas](https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/neuroscience-trait-boosts-creativity-intelligence-slows-aging-harvard-researcher-explain-how-boost.html).

    - **Note:** Walking keeps your brain slightly distracted which allows the new ideas to properly flow in.
