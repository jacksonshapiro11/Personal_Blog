### Highlights

- Embrace Chaos to Cultivate Creativity
  Summary:
  Nihilism and hope coexist in the creative process, suggesting that meaning can be derived from chaos.
  A culture that encourages fearless idea generation, free from the fear of judgment, fosters creativity. It’s essential to cultivate an environment where everyone's ideas are valued, beyond traditional hierarchies.
  This inclusiveness leads to diverse inspiration, often yielding the most authentic insights from those outside the creative roles.
  A structured brainstorming process, likened to an academic curriculum, allows for systematic idea curation, integrating both known and unknown themes to challenge conventional thinking.
  Ideas undergo rigorous vetting to ensure they align with the organizational identity and vision. Rules, seen as creative opportunities rather than constraints, enable boundary exploration. Embracing ambiguity within the law invites innovative interpretations, highlighting the fluidity of both creativity and legality. Additionally, there’s a caution against letting external validation, especially from venture capital and tech, shape creative directions. Staying grounded in genuine audience engagement is vital to maintaining authenticity and avoiding the pitfalls of insularity.

  Is it fair to say that there is both from an ingredients sense, some nihilism and some like incredible hope and generative?
  Speaker 1
  I think you nailed it. It's nihilism in the sense nothing matters and we're not necessarily going to make the world a better place, but maybe this will ease your fall. And in that sense, it's a little bit hopeful too. We're not mean-spirited. We're not edge lords necessarily trying to take the piss out of an institution or something like that. I think there's just a hidden way of seeing the world. Subversion can be a higher form of creative output. It just fuels us for some reason. There isn't even necessarily like a higher calling beyond our personal desire to make the most creative work of our lives.
  Speaker 2
  Let's talk about process in detail now. How, if I take anything that's coming off the line next week, how far back does it go? Who contributes ideas and how? What role do you play? How does the team work together in as much detail as you can? What is the process?
  Speaker 1
  The most important thing that I think I've done here was create a system where people are not afraid to have ideas. So if you think of any other creative workplace or creative industry, typically junior people are pitching to senior people. Jobs are on the line. Pride is on the line You're afraid to be wrong. You're afraid to be judged for a bad idea. To me, those are like the killers of creativity. So from the beginning, I did a lot of work, A, curating the right type of people where ego is not an obstacle to having a good idea or preventing someone else from having a good idea. Creating an environment where people can feel a little bit reckless, they can make mistakes, they can make a mess. And that's very straightforward. You look around at the space, it feels like you can make a mistake. Being in a warehouse is really important, actually. If we were in a white box in Soho, you wouldn't want to mess it up. And then creating also this culture where it doesn't feel like it's just my ideas getting made or the ideas that I like. That really boils down to creating a certain sense of codes and sensibilities that we all sort of agree on culturally. And you see that come through in the work. So that was the most important thing that I ever did. Because at the end of the day, the people who come up with the ideas at Mischief are actually everyone. You can work on the finance team. You can be our general counsel. You can be on the manufacturing production team. Anyone here can come up with a good idea. Anyone is capable of coming up with a good idea. And in fact, it's more valuable to get good ideas from people who aren't in the business of good ideas because their vantage point is real versus people who there are people whose jobs Are to come up with ideas, but they don't exist in a space that they can actually reflect on. It's fake. We choose to exist in real spaces. And then as a result, you create ideas that are able to exist in these spaces as well in a way that's very interactive and almost experiential in a way. So that's the vibe part. But then brass taxes, you brainstorm rigorously multiple times a week. They're timed on the same schedule every single time. There's a curriculum planned in advance. It's almost like designing a school curriculum. So every quarter, there are topics and concentrations and themes that we think are important for mischief in the future. And then also topics, concentrations, and themes that we have no idea about, just to challenge ourselves with new information and keep challenging ourselves to not just exist in our Own bubble that we've created. The brainstorms happen. Every idea is documented. We have an entire library of these ideas. And then over, I'd say like a three to six month period, all of these ideas are run through a fairly long tail vetting process that involves evaluation based on normal things like, can We afford to do this? How much money are we going to lose doing this? Will we make money on this? Is it even possible or does it need further research? But then also things like, does this shape the personality of mischief in the way that we want? It's almost like mischief is a child and we're like raising it. As soon as we land on concepts that we feel really good about, we actually put them in a pile and then forget about them. And that part is what makes this take six months. Because then we will open that pile six months later, look at them and be like, okay, I already forgot about these ideas, but now that I'm looking at them again, do I still feel very excited About them? Have they survived the test of time? And if they do, then they're ready to slot for production. And typically that's done about 12 months in advance. So even now we know all of next year's calendar already. We're already working on it.
  Speaker 2
  You've talked to me before about the value of rules. I think something you said was rules are interesting because they let you know where people before you drew the line. Say everything you've learned or think about rules and the role that they play.
  Speaker 1
  That line is specifically something I remember writing down when I was at West Point because there were just so many rules. They typically drove most people crazy while they were there because, I mean, it's the army. If you break rules, you're going to get in a lot of trouble. It's as simple as that. And there are so many rules for everything that it's impossible to not break a rule. But for me, and maybe this is my problem, but every rule was an opportunity to create some sort of absurdity that I thought was just really entertaining, even if it meant I had to do a thousand Push-ups for it. This is my coping mechanism. I'm going to put a copy of the Communist Manifesto on my bookshelf during the inspection just to see what happens. And of course, you get destroyed for that, but it's so funny when they see it on my shelf. And so very similarly with mischief, you look at these institutions, you look at how these herds of people operate in different worlds and different concentrations, and you understand Where their lines are. But we really see the lines as opportunities, not constraints. They're just creative opportunities.
  Speaker 2
  So you're playing with boundaries is the bottom line.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah. And I think in the most, I guess, concrete sense of the word, we even look at the law as a creative opportunity. And when you really think about the law, and hopefully all of us know this by now, the law is clearly not objective and it is not set in stone and it can be changed on a whim based on who's in Power at any given moment. So for us, we actually, we embrace that as a very creative opportunity to maybe change the way that the law is interpreted or even like create new laws. And I think that's very interesting, actually.

- Embrace the Absurd and Viral
  Summary:
  The creation of the big red boots represents a response to the fashion movement towards absurdity and reflects a broader trend where content consumption focuses more on reactions rather than new information.
  This phenomenon coincides with a peak in sneaker culture and the influence of algorithms on virality. Ultimately, even amid algorithmic constraints, genuine human resonance with a product can drive sharing and engagement.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Definitely the big red boots, for better or for worse. Say more. A year ago, we made these big red boots that just look like a Astro Boy. I mean, that's it. There's nothing really that profound about it. I think we made them at a time where there were a few things happening. One, in the fashion space, there was this movement towards the absurd, absurd pieces. So that was happening. Additionally, in the fashion space, and sort of just like in general, we live at a time where people aren't sharing new information. They're actually just sharing content of them reacting to new information. That's another thing that was going on. We were sort of at this peak of the hype cycle around sneakers and footwear and resale and all of that as well. And we're at a time where the algorithm is what dictates virality. But the alternative is still true, which is when human beings see something that resonates with them, they will find a way to share it or share their reaction to it.

- Embrace the Impossible
  Summary:
  Discipline and resilience are paramount for personal development, as learned through challenging experiences that require tackling seemingly impossible tasks.
  An academic structure that demands extensive homework fosters adaptability and problem-solving skills. Leadership lessons emerge from teamwork in high-pressure scenarios, demonstrating the importance of supporting others without hesitation.
  Exposure to diverse cultural elements broadens perspectives, essential for navigating complex environments.
  The impossible nature of tasks often recurs in various projects, highlighting a common thread among successful endeavors.
  Lastly, fashion serves dual purposes: utilitarian needs and the expression of identity and fantasy. This duality drives innovation in the industry and reflects societal values, as evidenced by the astronomical success of niche designs that emphasize absurdity and cultural commentary.

  The stark contrast is West Point in my mind. What is the most good and bad things that you remember or take from the couple of years that you were there? I think you left right before the obligatory service. Exactly. I did.
  Speaker 1
  So I did the hardest part, which was the first year. And then I stuck around one more year, which was about how long it takes to quit. So I mean, personally, I probably needed my ass kicked a little bit. I wasn't a fully formed human being yet. So there is something to say about the discipline and the work ethic that you get from it. I think the biggest thing is West Point to train you for what you're going to do later, they get you really comfortable with the impossible task. So the best example is the rule for the academic curriculum is for every hour that you're in class, you're assigned three hours of homework. But West Point isn't run like a normal college where you choose your schedule and stuff like that. No, you're in class for seven hours a day. So if you do the math, the math doesn't add up. Not their problem. You just have to figure it out. It's impossible. Let's say you get in trouble. You have to do a thousand pushups. Not many people can do a thousand pushups. Most people cannot, only a few in the world ever. Again, not their problem. You just have to find a way to get through it. And I think that was really valuable because mischief is used to taking on things where it's like, there's not really a playbook on how to do this. It's not straightforward at all. And you just figure it out. You roll your sleeves up and you figure it out. And I think that was a really valuable thing for me personally. And then sounds so cheesy. The leadership lessons are also like really good. I remember being out in the field during your summers out doing patrols for months. We were out in the field and there was a simulated mortar attack. So you see the things flying in, you hear the sounds and it's like, all right, we got to get out of here. And I remember my platoon leader was like, all right, we need to run this way, grab all your stuff. So it's like, you have an 80 pound bag, you've got your weapon, you're running. And there was someone on the team who was a lot smaller. I mean, she was probably like 70 pounds and she had an 80 pound bag as well. And she had a pretty bad trip because we're just running. You got to go. Without hesitation, he picks up her bag as well, hands her her weapon, and is like, let's go. So he shoulders close to 160 pounds and books it. And then once we get to safety, hands her back the bag, no questions asked, no issue. And I remember seeing that. I was like, I like that. You take care of your people, you don't make a big deal of it, and then you move on. I thought that was really good. Those were a couple of things that stuck with me. The bad things, I don't know. I think it's all like pretty good experience, actually. It's more so if I stayed, I was going to just keep getting in trouble. And that's when really bad things would happen.
  Speaker 2
  Do you think the fact that you came out of that, because I know prior to that, you really didn't have a lot of culture experience. My understanding is you were not allowed to do a lot of stuff as a kid, played a lot of piano and were incredibly- I was a pretty good classical pianist. Incredibly focused. Do you think that emerging as a 20-year without any influence on you ended up being a major part of why you're able to- I think it was huge. View the world this way.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, it was huge because I learned about culture all at once on a flat spectrum. I was learning about Urban Outfitters at the same time of learning about Kanye West at the same time of learning about Marvel and also Instagram had just been bought and the social network Had just come out. I was getting all of these things as if they were part of the same core curriculum. I do think that was very valuable. And you just have such an open mind because you're like, the world is so big and I don't really know where I belong here. I think that was everything, actually.
  Speaker 2
  The point you made about impossible tasks, the hours of homework or the pushups, what's the best analog in the projects that you've done? Which project was the most impossible task that you've tackled and gotten through. And I ask because it seems like every story I've heard, and I've heard so many now of people creating incredible things, this kind of ends up being a or the key ingredient. Yeah.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah. I should have specified earlier. I think most people in their careers do hit this wall and they learn how to deal with the impossible task. The thing about West Point is like, I got it on day one as an 18 year old, super valuable. For us, I mean, mischief is the impossible task. We shouldn't even be here, right? Like on paper, this doesn't make any sense. There's a good friend of mine who is actually, he spent some time in VC. And I remember talking to him in 2019 when I was trying to figure out if I was going to raise for this or not. And he was like, honestly, I like you, but I don't think you can do it. And it has nothing to do with you. It just doesn't work this way. This kind of thing doesn't work. You need such a repeatable hit rate. You need such a strong understanding of audience and retention and a nose for culture. It can't work. It can't last. Actually, I hung out with him a few weeks ago and he said, yeah, I remember that conversation. And honestly, if someone came to me today, pitching what you were pitching, I would tell them the same thing. Like it shouldn't exist. I agree. It shouldn't. This is the impossible thing. And then every project has also got its impossibilities too. And you just figure it out.
  Speaker 2
  Tell us what you've learned about fashion.
  Speaker 1
  I think fashion is two things. I think on one side, fashion is utility, basic needs, shelter, protection. And then the other side is fantasy, costumes. Human beings love costumes. Personally, I hate Halloween, but people freaking love Halloween. And then I go to these fashion runway shows and I'm like, wait, they're just celebrating Halloween early. This is crazy, right? It does come down to fantasy. And the fantasy is not just tied to aesthetics, but it's also tied to value and legacy and symbolism and cultural ready-mades. And because of that, I think it is such a rich space to play in because also it is so tied to identity. These are symbols that are created by designers, that are created by brands that you wear on your body. And in some ways, they kind of serve the same function as a painting in your home might. So I think it's interesting. When Mischief sees that, we're like, okay, you can try to focus on creating things that are aesthetically pleasing, and that's one way to go. But you can also seek to exploit the tensions that people have between these objects, not just from an aesthetic perspective, but also like a value perspective, an identity perspective. Last summer, we made a handbag that was the size of a grain of salt because we noticed this pattern of the smaller the handbag gets, the more expensive it seems to become. And we're like, w...
