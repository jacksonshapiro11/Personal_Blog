### Highlights

- Mars was created by a guy named frank. Had polio as a kid so had to stay in and cook. Started making candy. Had 3 bankruptcy all making sugar based candy then tried a new thing watch was chocolate and the guy was skipping town running from people then he finally hit it big. Hershey invents chocolate in the us instead of doing the complex chemistry they do in Europe he just experimented and that’s why Hershey is sour. Its actually a bit spoiled. So Hershey invents chocolate in America and then in ww1 then prohibition is becomes very popular and every region develops their own candy bar legit 40k different ones and Hershey is supplying them all with the chocolate. Right time and place for him and chocolate. He saw how big it was in Europe and basically bet the farm to make it in the us and was very successful. The army liked it because chocolate and adding nougat was Calory dense.

  What's different now about this fourth candy company that Frank starts? It's chocolate.
  Ben Gilbert
  And chocolate is a completely different universe than these penny candies, than caramels. The first thing you have to know is it uses cocoa. I mean, this is a very, at this point in history, scarce and not very common in America. Like, very few people ([Time 0:13:30](https://share.snipd.com/snip/631166a3-01c8-440e-aee7-e4df89007d5e))
- **Chocolate Making Process**
  - Chocolate production starts with fermenting and drying cocoa beans, influencing their flavor.
  - The beans are then shipped, sorted, roasted, and winnowed to separate the nibs.
  - Nibs are ground and conched to refine the texture, sometimes adding cocoa butter for creaminess.
  - Conching was discovered accidentally by Rudolf Lindt in 1879.
  - Tempering aligns cocoa butter crystals to achieve the desired shine and snap.
  - Sugar and milk are added in varying percentages to create different chocolate types.

  Ben Gilbert
  And we have a huge thank you to Todd Masonis at Dandelion Chocolate, which is an excellent, excellent bean-to chocolate company in San Francisco, for walking us through this entire Thing, not only giving us all the notes of how to describe it on air, but also taking us through their factory in San Francisco, which is unbelievably cool if anyone has a chance to do it. So where does chocolate come from? There's a cocoa fruit that grows on a tree originally in South America, now very commonly in Africa where they've been transplanted. It's kind of a football looking thing. You pick it, you cut open the pod, and inside there are the seeds of the fruit. David, you and I sort of ate some of it or sucked on some of it. It's sweet, but it's not chocolate. It has no reflection of a chocolate flavor. That all comes from the seeds or the beans.
  David Rosenthal
  Yeah, the fruit itself is actually quite delicious, but it's like a pulpy sort of milky type thing. Yes.
  Ben Gilbert
  So that fruit is actually the thing that people ate for thousands of years, but the seed ends up being the thing that becomes chocolate. You first ferment those beans in wooden boxes. The yeast eats the sugar. That creates alcohol. Then the acid eats the alcohol. There's fermentation that kills the beans. After this fermentation, you then dry it. All this happens at the site of production or of growth, typically in South America or in Africa. So then after the fermentation, you dry it out. So this could happen sort of in drying beds or in mechanical smoke dryers or on banana leaves. All the different ways that you dry it can affect the flavor. How aggressively you dry it contributes to how much acid is in the beans. So there's a lot of fluctuation here in the flavor just based on the way that you are harvesting the bean itself. The beans then go into sacks, they go on boats, they go at this point in history basically to Europe because that was the only place that was making chocolate. They then get sorted, sterilized, debacterialized. I suspect not a lot of this was happening in the old days, but it is what happens now. They get roasted. You remove the shell, which is a process called winnowing. So now you have nibs.
  David Rosenthal
  So just like the core meat of the bean after it's been roasted.
  Ben Gilbert
  Yes. You can press those nibs into create two separate things, cocoa powder and cocoa butter. Both of those come from the nib, but there are many reasons why different chocolatiers will first separate them out and recombine them in different ratios later. You grind the nibs down to the right particle size. It then goes through something called conching.
  David Rosenthal
  Conching is awesome. It's basically like these big cylinders, right, that like spin around and around and smooth out all these particles.
  Ben Gilbert
  Yeah. And there's a great story back in 1879 that Rudolf Lindt, which is another name you may recognize, the Swiss chocolatier, discovered it by accidentally leaving his cocoa in a roller Grinder over the weekend instead of shutting the machine off. So it accidentally pressed the beans for three full days, which created this silky, smooth, flowing texture. And then you could do cool stuff like add more cocoa butter in to get that Swiss chocolate texture that we all know of today. If you've had it and you're like, how is this so unbelievably creamy? You know, you separate the nibs into cocoa powder, cocoa butter, and then you add a bunch more cocoa butter back in, and it's that delicious Swiss chocolate. So 1879 is when conching sort of first discovered. Now there's, David, to your point, specific conching machines that will do this as a part of the chocolate production process. Still not done yet. You now have this great, conched, liquidious, wonderful chocolate sitting there. If you just let it dry, it's actually not shelf stable. It will bloom. For any of you who ever left a chocolate bar in a hot car and it sort of melted and then re-solidified, it gets that sort of white gross stuff on top and it doesn't have that shine to it. It doesn't snap nicely the way that you're used to a chocolate bar snapping. There's actually some pretty complicated chemistry that happens where you are taking this conched chocolate and you are tempering it. And what tempering it does is you are aligning the crystals in the cocoa butter to make it so that it forms into that shiny breakable chocolate that you know of today.
  David Rosenthal
  And this is an incredible process, right? You take this liquid chocolate after conching, you heat it up to like kind of super liquefy it, and then you cool it down to like just the right amount of temperature where the right sort Of seed crystals form.
  Ben Gilbert
  That's exactly right.
  David Rosenthal
  Right. And then you heat it back up again and then you let it cool. And if you don't do that second step, all the bloom will happen, but you want to get like just the right seed crystals to set the right crystal and structure for how it'll come together.
  Ben Gilbert
  That's exactly right. When you're superheating it, you're eliminating all crystals. So then you can kind of start from scratch with this seed crystal. And then you're trying to let the rest of the chocolate form around that seed crystal. So they're all aligned in that nice shiny break.
  David Rosenthal
  Believe me, I appreciated chocolate before doing this episode. But now, like knowing how it's made, right? And we haven't even gotten to milk chocolate yet, which is even more complex. This is more complex than wine. This is more complex than coffee.
  Ben Gilbert
  Ooh, shots fired on wine and coffee. You're going to hear something.
  David Rosenthal
  Well, at least in terms of like stages of production, right? Like let's take coffee. Coffee looks pretty similar until, you know, you get the beans there roasted, but then you grind the beans and you just put the beans in liquid. You're not getting any of these steps here.
  Ben Gilbert
  Chocolate is remarkably hard to make. I think that is a huge takeaway. The fact that I'm looking down here at all these bags of M&Ms and the Snickers bar, we sort of just assume, oh, this is a This is an industrial thing that just sort of comes off the line. It's an agricultural product that then has to go through a variety of different processes developed on different continents many decades apart in order to create something very uniform And predictable and desirable out of that pure agricultural product.
  David Rosenthal
  Yep. Okay.
  Ben Gilbert
  So that's all the way from the fruit, through the fermentation, through the processing of the beans, through the conching, through the tempering.
  David Rosenthal
  And in those last steps of the process in the conching and the tempering, you're also adding sugar in, right? So like, unless you want to make 100% dark chocolate, which is like very complex, but very bitter.
  Ben Gilbert
  No one's going to eat that. Most people max out at 85% chocolate and the rest, the 15% is sugar, or you're getting a 70% bar and the 30% is sugar. Or if you're getting a milk chocolate bar, it's more in that 30 to 50% cocoa and the rest is sugar and milk. But in reality, most of the time you're eating chocolate these days, unless it's a bean-to producer, like a dandelion or something, you're ending up with all sorts of stuff added in That process. You know, more cocoa butter, sugar, soy lecithin. Oftentimes, you'll get vanilla that's added in part of this process to kind of create a chocolate taste you know of. Yep.
  David Rosenthal
  Okay, so we're still in the dark chocolate worl... ([Time 0:17:29](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5559b015-9c53-4fb8-899f-532a5811d80c))

  * Forrest Mars, at 19, worked as a traveling cigarette salesman and landed in jail for illegal marketing.
  * He called his estranged father, Frank, for bail, reuniting after 13 years.
  * Over lunch, Forrest suggested turning a malted milkshake into a candy bar, leading to the Milky Way.
  * Forrest's background: Sent to Canada at six, excelled academically, and showed early entrepreneurial signs at Berkeley.
  * Witnessing his father's success shifted Forrest's ambition from mining to business.
  * Constantly learning transfers goes to Yale and his roommates dad is DuPont a very successful industrialist and he learns from him. 
  * Great systems thinker.
  Transcript:
  David Rosenthal
  Well, let's tell the legend. So, summer 1923, young Forrest Mars is 19 years old, and on summer break from college—more on college in a minute—he's got a summer job as a traveling salesman selling camel cigarettes. Times sure were different. Times sure were different. I mean, it's debatable how true any of this is, so we'll roll with it. One night, he's in Chicago in late summer, and he gets instructions from his boss that they really got to blow it out. They need to hit big time sales numbers here in Chicago. Forrest, you got to go blitz the whole city with posters marketing camel cigarettes. So Forrest goes around and he puts billboards up all over downtown Chicago. Supposedly like every storefront window State Street, he's plastering with Camel cigarette posters, which certainly gets attention. It actually makes the Chicago Tribune the next morning that this happened. But also, much like if we were to do an acquired marketing stunt like Baby Ruth and drop stuff from an airplane these days, it's also illegal. Yes. And it lands young Forrest in jail. So from his Chicago prison cell, Forrest makes his one phone call to the only soul that he knows in the area who could possibly bail him out, his estranged father, Frank Mars.
  Ben Gilbert
  Which this whole thing, I mean, this is the legend and this is the Mars Company's version of the story. This is the journalist's version of the story. This has been in other books. But like the guy hasn't seen his father since he was six years old and he somehow knows his phone number to call him from jail. By the way, his dad lives in Minnesota. There's the whole state of Wisconsin between Minneapolis and Chicago.
  David Rosenthal
  But we're giving you a flavor of who Forrest is here.
  Ben Gilbert
  If Forrest was in charge of coming up with the story of how this all went, this is the story he would have come up with. So. Yes, exactly.
  David Rosenthal
  And as we'll see, Forrest is in charge of everything. So Frank shows up at the jail. Father and son are reunited after 13 years, during which, yeah, Ben, like you said, they've had no contact with each other. But Forrest has his phone number to call him. Frank bails out Forrest. By now, it's early afternoon of the next day. And he says, all right, son, let's go out for lunch. And they go to a luncheonette to share a meal at which young Forrest, who is selling cigarettes, orders a wholesome malted milkshake over this lunch reunion with his father. They get to talking. They're getting reacquainted. And Forrest learns that his dad is now this middlingly successful candy entrepreneur. And his dad's telling him about this Morrow Bar that he's introduced. Forrest says, well, hey, I got an idea for you. What if you take this malted milkshake here? Everybody loves a malted milkshake. What if you take that and put that into a candy bar? And, you know, like I'm obviously pretty good at, you know, street marketing here. I bet I can go sell that all around the country. So they get to talking, jamming, father and son. And with that, the Milky Way bar was born with the marketing of a malted milkshake in a candy bar. And this is the story.
  Ben Gilbert
  There's so much in between. I have an idea that you should put a malted milkshake in a bar and actually what a Milky Way is. It's nougat and caramel inside of chocolate. It's a pretty different ingredient set than a malted milkshake. There had to be quite a bit of R&D experimentation, flavor development to figure out how to make the inside of your candy bar taste like said malted milkshake.
  David Rosenthal
  But here is the exact quote from Forrest, as recorded in the family archives that Joel got access to as part of her access to the company. He says, quote, I'll be damned if a short time after our lunch, the old man has a candy bar. And it's a chocolate malted drink. He put some caramel on top of it and some chocolate around it. Not very good chocolate. He was buying cheap chocolate back then, but that damn thing sold. No advertising. No forest. Regardless of how all this happens, Frank Mars does release in 1924 the Milky Way Bar, and it does become a big hit. That year alone, the first year that it comes out, it does $800,000 in sales. Yes.
  Ben Gilbert
  The Morrow Bar Company went from $73,000 to $793,000 in one year.
  David Rosenthal
  And that is all the Milky Way. Like, undeniably huge success.
  Ben Gilbert
  And effectively, what they were doing was they were the first ones who said, wait a minute, if we're going to make a count line, we should do it in a mechanical way. And so even though all these other people are selling these one-offs locally to different stores and hand-making them, they were doing it in factory quantities all under the same production Process and brand.
  David Rosenthal
  Yep.
  Ben Gilbert
  Now, it was early industrialization, but it was still much more industrial than the rest of the manufacturers at this point.
  David Rosenthal
  Totally. Now, first question you should be asking here is, wait, Forrest is in college now and ends up in jail in Chicago? Like, what the hell happened here? Okay, so when Forrest is six years old, as we said, he gets sent off to live in Saskatchewan in Canada in like a hardscrabble rural mining community with his grandparents. Unlike, I imagine, most of the folks around him, Forrest is a total outlier there. He's super smart, super entrepreneurial, super ambitious, and he's a super arrogant show-off. Probably because he's so insecure from his deeply traumatic childhood.
  Ben Gilbert
  Debra Cabry has a good line in her book, Noah's flood wouldn't have deterred Forrest Mars.
  David Rosenthal
  Yes. So when Forrest graduates, unlike everybody else there who goes off to work in the mines, he supposedly wins a scholarship to the University of California in Berkeley. Now, how he wins a scholarship to UC Berkeley, which is, you know, the public university of California, when he's living in Canada and he's from Minneapolis is suspect, but we'll go With it. He does show up at Berkeley, though, we know that, and he enrolls in the School of Mining there with the idea that he is going to study to become a mining engineer and go back and run a mine Instead of just being a laborer in a mine.
  Ben Gilbert
  And this all makes sense. He had an engineer's mind. I mean, he also had a marketing mind, but he ended up building a company that ran an incredible efficiency and thought through it as sort of a systems thinker. Yes, 100%.
  David Rosenthal
  So while he's at Berkeley in his first year there to make money and support himself, he takes a job in the cafeteria. ([Time 0:45:12](https://share.snipd.com/snip/97b89624-a8eb-4803-bb8f-8b086661a995))
- They move product to Chicago to be on the rail lines. Forrest is menically focused his dad is happy being rich. Rift starts forming. Forrest builds state of the art assembly line runs it 24/7 not just working hours. They also develop the Milky Way snickers and 3 musketeers in this time. It’s the depression and they’re still doing very well.
  Transcript:
  Ben Gilbert
  Yes. So, listeners, you are probably thinking to yourself, a Three Musketeers bar is just that nougat and chocolate. It doesn't have peanuts. It doesn't have caramel. Why would this come after a Snickers? Well, Three Musketeers is actually a misnomer. I see you're eating at Three Musketeers. Way to be in theme. It was actually sold as a package containing three separate bars, each with a different flavor, chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry. And due to restrictions during World War II, they had to cut production to just the chocolate version. I think part of it was also a spike in strawberry prices. And so they just did away with the vanilla. And so now it's just called Three Musketeers, even though it's only the chocolate variant. One Musketeer doesn't have the same ring to it.
  David Rosenthal
  No, no, it doesn't. So if you're paying attention here and thinking, you're like, wait a minute, they built this factory in 1928, 1929. Sales are skyrocketing. ([Time 1:04:27](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f83fd891-f382-412e-ab6e-b7c5263a6f08))
- **Forrest Mars' Ultimatum and Exile**
  - Forrest Mars, recognizing the opportunity presented by the Depression, urged his father Frank to invest heavily in the business.
  - Frank, content with their current success, declined, leading to Forrest issuing an ultimatum: give him one-third of the company or he would leave.
  - Frank refused, and Forrest left for Europe with $50,000 and the international rights to the Milky Way recipe, vowing never to speak to his father again.
  - Frank died the next year, and Forrest didn't return for the funeral, marking the end of their relationship.
  - Forrest's time in Europe became crucial for acquiring the skills and assets he'd later use upon his return to the US.
  Transcript:
  David Rosenthal
  Yep. And actually, you know, I think to be fair to Frank, I think that is really like Frank's influence on the business and company there. Forrest, as great as he was at so many things, he was never a product innovator in the way that Frank was. Hmm. Makes sense. As evidenced by the fact that, you know, here we are today eating the most popular candies in the world that Mars makes, and it's still Snickers, Milky Way, Three Musketeers, M&Ms, which We will get into. That was Forrest's big contribution. Yep.
  Ben Gilbert
  So, Depression. Sales are going great.
  David Rosenthal
  Here we are, 1932, the worst years of the depression. And Forrest totally recognizes all this, like, we need to invest, invest, invest, pedal to the metal. We are going to use everything happening here to blow away our competition. We're going to go compete with Hershey. We're going to become huge. Frank, though, has no interest. According to Forrest, quote, my father says we're making enough money. We have an airplane. We've got the fishing place. We've got horses. Why do we need any more? And Forrest's reply to that is, quote, I want to conquer the whole goddamn world. So he issues his dad an ultimatum. Look, obviously you want to just go enjoy life. Let me run things. Give me one third of the stock of the business. You keep two thirds and you relax and I will make you even richer. Frank turns him down.
  Ben Gilbert
  And I think he turns him down in kind of insulted. Like I built this business and you came in recently and you're just randomly asking me to give you a third of it. Go to hell.
  David Rosenthal
  Yeah. And, you know, of course, there's more behind this. Forrest was not liked within the company. He's driving everybody hard. Frank is this kind of a distracted leader. You can imagine, you know, if you're a line worker or even if you're a manager within the company... That's great. Which boss do you prefer? Right. Yeah. So the company certainly sided with Frank here. There's also the family element, too. Frank's got a new family now. So he's got his wife, the other Athol. He's got his daughter, Patricia. Frank's like, yeah, hey, I mean, you're my son too. You've helped me build this business, but I'm not just going to give you a third of the business. Either way, there's quite a bit of animosity around this. And Forrest walks out and in the process tells his dad to, quote, stick his business up his ass.
  Ben Gilbert
  There's no missing words in any of these direct quotes. It's crazy. Yeah, literally.
  David Rosenthal
  I mean, this is what he said he said. So Forrest leaves town, not to Chicago, but leaves America entirely, goes off to a new continent to build his own business, his own way, leave Mars Incorporated totally behind him,
  Ben Gilbert
  Leave him in the dust.
  David Rosenthal
  Almost.
  Ben Gilbert
  He takes with him a right. Yes. He has the right to what, David? He takes actually two things with him that his dad sort of gives him as he's heading out the door.
  David Rosenthal
  One, $50,000. And two, the foreign rights to the Milky Way recipe. Yes.
  Ben Gilbert
  But I don't think the Milky Way name.
  David Rosenthal
  No, not the Milky Way name, just the recipe.
  Ben Gilbert
  You can't market this as Milky Way, but you can sell this recipe internationally.
  David Rosenthal
  Yep. So Forrest takes these two sort of parting gifts, tells his dad that he'll never hear from him again, leaves America entirely. And super sadly, Frank doesn't ever hear from him again.
  Ben Gilbert
  Yeah, this is the last time that Frank and Forrest would ever speak.
  David Rosenthal
  Yeah. The next year when Frank is just 50 years old, he collapses in the Chicago factory and dies of kidney failure. And Forrest doesn't come back for the funeral. Yeah. Yep. That was it.
  Ben Gilbert
  Now, granted, in the 30s, much harder to come back from Europe on short notice, but still. Yep. So Forrest is over in Europe, and the set of events of what he does in Europe to build this ridiculous, almost Trojan horse, like the set of skills he acquires, the assets he builds up, Is crazy before he comes back to the U.S. ([Time 1:07:26](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8607512e-6707-4543-9e8a-3096d55b5ba2))
- **Forrest Mars's Chocolate Apprenticeship**
  * In 1932, Forrest Mars Sr. moved his family to Europe to learn chocolate-making.
  * He believed that knowing the core product was essential for success.
  * He worked incognito on factory lines at Tobler and Nestle, learning the trade firsthand.
  * After a year, he moved to England and started a small factory, adapting the Milky Way for British tastes and calling it the Mars Bar.
  * The Mars Bar became one of the most popular candy bars in the UK.
  * Insanely high agency legit goes to Europe as a accomplished man to conquer the world.
  Transcript:
  David Rosenthal
  So we're here at the end of 1932. Forrest and his young family now, by the way, with his young son, Forrest Jr., land first in Paris. And Forrest tries a couple little things, but eventually he decides that if he's really going to build his own big company and stick it to his dad, he needs to learn the one critical thing That his dad didn't know. He needs to learn how to make chocolate. Yes. No better place than Europe to learn. Here's his quote on it. You can hire lawyers. You can hire accountants. You can hire advertising men or financial types. But if you want to get rich, you got to know how to make a product. And you aren't going to hire anybody to make a product for you to make you rich. They'll only make it for themselves. True that. Forrest is just like, he's such a freaking G. Like if it hasn't come across already on this episode, he is Hall of Fame. Complete G. You got to know how to do the scarce thing. Totally. So important. So, in early 1933, Forrest moves his family from Paris to Switzerland to go learn from the chocolate masters. And Forrest goes to work, first at Jean Tobler, making Toblerone, and then at the original itself, Nestle.
  Ben Gilbert
  In the factories, without disclosing to anyone who he is.
  David Rosenthal
  So yeah, when I say he goes to work there, it's not like he calls them up and is like, I'm Forrest Mars. He doesn't tell anybody who he is. His quote on this later is like, well, they never asked. And he doesn't go get management roles. He goes and gets jobs on the line as a factory worker, learning directly how these machines work, how these chemical processes work, how to make chocolate. Amazing.
  Ben Gilbert
  Who would do this today? It takes a very specific type of person. If you're sitting there thinking, hmm, only some European company knows how to do this well. And I'm someone who attended an Ivy League college. My family is wealthy. I'm friends with the DuPonts. Not only that, I basically feel like I've already built a $25 million business. But I'm going to upend myself, my family, and my life and go and be a line worker in a plant in another country. I mean, in this era, in the 30s, where it's difficult to get over there, I imagine he went by boat. I imagine they didn't speak English in the Swiss factory. Yeah. Would you ever do this, listener, if you're looking around at a pretty good life that you have and you're saying, I'm going to go to a different continent, move my family up in my whole Life so I can go and learn this scarce skill that I know is the key to building a world-dominating business. It's a big trade-off.
  David Rosenthal
  Big, big trade-off. And totally on brand for Forrest.
  Ben Gilbert
  Because you couldn't learn it in America. That's the other thing. Hershey is super secretive at this point in time. No one knows their formula.
  David Rosenthal
  Well, I think not only is Hershey super secretive, the sense I get, at least from Emperors of Chocolate, is they knew how to productionize their recipe, but they didn't actually know The science of how it worked. They kind of got there through trial and error. Huh. The sense I got is that the European chocolate manufacturers and probably Nestle in particular, they really knew what they were doing. And Hershey sort of in an industrial sense knew what they were doing, but nobody there really knew the science behind it. Second plant outside of Hershey, Pennsylvania. They can't get it to work. They can't get the chocolate to taste the same. Because they don't exactly know how they get that specific sour note in the taste.
  Ben Gilbert
  That's so interesting.
  David Rosenthal
  But anyway, back to Forrest. So for most of the year of 1933, they're just in Switzerland and he's working on the factory lines, learning how to make chocolate. And then toward the end of the year, when he feels like he's learned everything he needs to know, he moves the family to England, where he uses the $50,000 to open up a small factory in Slough, England, which is a small industrial town about 20 miles west of London. It's right near where Heathrow Airport is today. And he installs the family in a one-room apartment above the factory, and they start making a version of the Milky Way adapted to British tastes.
  Ben Gilbert
  Which basically means more sugar, right? Yep.
  David Rosenthal
  More sugar and less malt. Malt is not as big in British tastes. So he has the recipe to the Milky Way that he's adapted now for British tastes, but he doesn't have the naming rights, and so he names it the Mars Bar. And this, of course, goes on to become the most popular candy bar in the UK, I think, still to this day. ([Time 1:14:59](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a53b418b-90bd-40b2-96f2-3b9e0583c587))
- **Mars' Five Principles**
  * **Quality:** Obsessive focus on every aspect of quality, from ingredients to displays, enabling impulse purchases and building a compounding advantage by offering superior value.
  * **Responsibility:** Empowering employees with high pay, tying compensation to company performance, and fostering a culture of ownership. 10% bonus if you’re never late. Toyota production system like controls. 
  * **Mutuality:** Recognizing the importance of a thriving ecosystem, ensuring that partners benefit from their association with Mars, creating long-term incentives, and driving compounding advantages.
  * **Efficiency:** Data-driven management, drawing inspiration from early business literature and focusing on facts and figures for informed decision-making.
  * **Freedom:** Encouraging autonomy and independent thinking by providing employees with the space and resources they need to innovate and excel, a crucial element for long-term success.
  Transcript:
  David Rosenthal
  And this here in Slough in England is really where the principles, literally the principles, Mars calls them the five principles of the company today. But just the culture of Mars gets set. Oh yeah, you found the original ones, right? Yes. So if you talk to anybody who works or worked at Mars, they will quote the principles at you religiously.
  Ben Gilbert
  It's like the Amazon leadership principles. Totally.
  David Rosenthal
  It's like, oh, that's principle number five, freedom. Or, oh, that's principle number three, mutuality, et cetera, et cetera. I think how these started, maybe even back in England, Forrest started a document called The Mars Way where he was like codifying all this. And I think after he retired and the business passed to his sons and the next generation, I think that's when they sort of adapted that document into the Mars principles. But it's really interesting. It's worth going through them all. So number one, the first principle is quality. Forrest was completely obsessed with quality on every dimension. You know, the ingredients that are going into the candy bars, the candy bars themselves, the wrappers, the shelf placement displays. He was way ahead of the curve on all this stuff. He knew the candy was an impulse purchase and like the way the product actually looks, how it's displayed, what the packaging is, what the placement is in the shelf in the retailer. How consistent it is. How consistent it is. These were like big, big drivers of purchases.
  Ben Gilbert
  And there's, of course, the famous story about he, you know, finds a defect in a wrapper and then he calls his executives into a room and he hurls it at the glass and says, you know, yeah, It's his temper and his obsession with quality all combined into one.
  David Rosenthal
  Yeah, I'm laughing. You say famous story. I'm like, which one? I think there are a million of these stories. But even here in the 30s in the UK, he basically implements the Toyota production system in the Mars factory. This is long before the Toyota production system exists. Any employee in the factory could stop the line for any reason at any time. If there's anything that's out of place, anything that could impact quality, you know, anything is dirty, anything is not perfect, every single worker in the entire facility can stop
  Ben Gilbert
  The whole line and he also if something had a defect he would throw out the whole batch right yes as like a let's scorch the earth around the defect yep i'm sure he wasn't thinking about
  David Rosenthal
  It in these terms but he really wants to instill this as a cultural norm in the company so anytime if there was a mistake that forrest then found that hadn't been caught on the line, he would Just berate whoever should have stopped the line and be like, you needed to have stopped and fixed this. You cannot let this get into the finished product. The other aspect of the quality principle, though, much like Ikea, it's not just quality for quality's sake. It's quality for money. It's quality at a given price, value for money. You know, we've already been talking about how this is like the ultimate scale business and scale economies business in candies. Forrest knows that if you can offer a higher quality for a given price than your competitors, you're just going to build a lead and compound forever and ever and ever in this business. So quality principle number one, most important. Two, this is awesome. Responsibility is the second principle. And you might be like, oh, responsibility, like, okay, whatever. For all of his crazy intensity, Forrest was not a micromanager. He wanted to like know how to do everything in the business, including making chocolate. But he knew that if he was going to scale, like he wants to be DuPont here, you know, he wants to be General Motors. He needs the best people working the hardest in charge of everything. Like he can't be around telling them how to do their jobs. So the question then is when you're starting up in a new country, tiny factory, how do you get the best people? How do you incentivize them? He's like, well, I'll just pay them. I'll just pay them a lot. So for years and years, the standard within Mars was that you should make three to four times the normal salary for your job.
  Ben Gilbert
  That's so insane. And I think that's come down over the years.
  David Rosenthal
  It's now like 2x, but it's still true.
  Ben Gilbert
  I even saw numbers that say they try to pay their employees a minimum of 10% higher than other companies in the industry.
  David Rosenthal
  Interesting. But definitely in those early days, it's like, no, we're going to pay you three or four times the amount that you would make elsewhere.
  Ben Gilbert
  I also know they try to tie pay aggressively to the performance of the company. So high bonuses rather than high salaries, which also means in tough years, they would just cut. It's not quite having equity in the company, but it's much more akin to being a partner in a business than it is to being an employee. Exactly.
  David Rosenthal
  Okay. So, you know, I said salaries. It's not salaries, it's bonuses. This is what your take-home pay should be. Everyone's salary in the company, again, starting in the earliest days there in Slough, tied to overall company performance and hitting overall company metrics. There is no, at least in the early days, individual performance element to your bonus, except for one thing. Do you know what the one thing is? The one individual performance metric? Did you show up on time? You get a 10% bonus if you are never late in the entire year. And it's everybody from Forrest himself on down. Everybody has a time card. You punch the time card when you go in.
  Ben Gilbert
  I'm pretty sure this is still true that the CEO of Mars today has a time card and they punch in and out every day. And a 10% bonus is contingent on not being late.
  David Rosenthal
  So even more, I don't think this terminology starts until they get back to America, but everybody in the company is an associate. Obviously, people are in charge of different things and have different external titles. But internally, everybody is an associate. There are no perks for anyone. So there are no executive parking spaces. There's no executive offices.
  Ben Gilbert
  Boy, Forrest really wants to rebel against his father.
  David Rosenthal
  There are no offices, period, to this day at Mars. Is this the first open office company? So we said on the meta episode that we thought Facebook was the first open office. No, Mars was the first open office starting in the 1930s. So every building, entirely open floor plan. You get a black metal desk. Get this. This is how crazy it is. Again, even still to this day, there are just a small number of conference rooms in any given Mars office.
  Ben Gilbert
  Oh, yeah, because they hate presentations, right?
  David Rosenthal
  They hate presentations. They hate meetings. But like sometimes you have to have a meeting. The conference rooms do not have doors. There is no privacy allowed anywhere, which is the craziest thing, given that the company itself externally is incredibly private. But no, internally, the culture...

Mars doesn’t want him back so he goes to Hersheys number 2 Murray and offers to work with his son. Mars and Murray is born. also because Murray runs hershsy he gives his son preferential treatment. When everyone can’t get chocolate because of ww2 m&m can. They sell to military first. Forest retains 80% of business genius move all around found the guy he needs direct line to government. He also invents uncle Ben’s. Forrest has a massive temper and motivates people. Pushes Murray out because he’s not selling well it isn’t catching on then does an indepth market study. They marketed to parents and kids on tv. They just went from basically 0 to 40mm in sales. Owned the market. Developed a brand with the m on the candy. Eventually he gets control of the family company like he wanted and he’s in control of it all.

  And I suspect many of our British friends are listening to all this and saying like, hey, guys, what about Smarties? Forrest, of course, was not the only one to spot the potential of Draje chocolates for military use and then eventually for public consumption. Well, like all things with Forrest's history, it's a little bit hard to untangle truth from fiction. But one thing that is undeniably true is that Roundtree's introduced Smarties to the British market in 1937. So three to four years before M&M's startup in the U.S. And two years before Forrest even leaves the U.K. Right.
  Ben Gilbert
  So he's saying it's this Spanish-American war thing, but very plausibly, he just saw Smarties in the U.K. And was like, I got to go back to America and launch this quick.
  David Rosenthal
  There is no way that Forrest did not see Smarties in the UK before he left. And the early M&Ms came in tube packaging just like Smarties. Suspicious.
  Ben Gilbert
  Also, for the American listeners, you're probably like, Smarties, those are a non-chocolate candy. What are you talking about? Those are different Smarties that are in the U.S. Market.
  David Rosenthal
  Yes, British Smarties are delicious. I loved eating them growing up with my British family when I would go visit them in the summers. ([Time 2:03:35](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c3b865f9-f57d-4ef6-b1ef-92d6922a6618))
- **Mars' Commodity Advantage**
  * Mars had a cost advantage over Hershey's due to their ingredients.
  * They sold products with lower costs (nougat, peanuts) for a similar perceived value, allowing them to lower prices during commodity price increases, squeezing Hershey's margins.
  * Hershey didn’t advertise at all to their detriment. They saw it as a cost not investment. 
  * Mars had a great hedging strategy and actually make money trading commodities it’s not just a cost they’re at the mercy of.
  * Mars gives the business to his kids. Retires gets bored then creates another chocolate business at 70 which the kids eventually buy.

  I mean, it has nougat and peanuts. And so what they basically do, there's another time, I think this happens in the early 80s, where Mars knows that the commodity prices are on the uptick for cocoa. And so it's going to squeeze everyone's margins, but it's going to hurt Hershey the most. So what does Mars do? They announce bigger bars at cheaper prices. What can Hershey do? They're just getting boxed in from all angles. And so this is a sustainable, competitive advantage that Mars has selling something that has just lower cost of goods for an equal perception of value to customers.
  David Rosenthal
  Yep. The other thing that Mars builds up through, maybe even starting in the 60s, but definitely in the 70s and 80s, is a very, very sophisticated commodities trading department that Hershey Doesn't have. Oh, really?
  Ben Gilbert
  Of course they do. Hedging and...
  David Rosenthal
  Of course. It's this very Mars style to do this. Now, obviously, it's a private company. They never report any of this. But rumors are, these are rumors, but I've heard it from multiple places. Mars has actually made many billions of dollars of profit from commodity trading over the years. ([Time 2:46:16](https://share.snipd.com/snip/00ab7f6e-d5a2-4c72-abf2-b3c5e69588f7))
