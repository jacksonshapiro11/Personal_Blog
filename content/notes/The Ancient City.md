### Highlights

- Christianity turned religion from something human to something divine gods to be feared to gods to be loved. Religion taught loving the neighbor and spreading the good word not conflict. Religion spread good values and taught love and connection. Created a global vs hyper local society. There was a common father and unity of men. Christ separated clearly fir the first time religion and the state. This piggy backed on stoic beliefs saying the body might belong to the state but the soul was owned fully internally. Fully autonomy over the mind. This freed the mind and created individual Liberty created by the stoics adopted by the Christian’s. The duty of citizens were modified. More individual rights private and public virtues put the individual over the state and did not opine on the law. Law was independent and could evolve and change with morals. This destroyed fully the ancient constitution of the family. The changing of religion and overhaul of citizenship finalized the last parts of the old society. The ancient world ends here. Society changed its character completely here.

    - **Note:** The founding of Christianity changed the world and liberated the soul from the body. This is a stoic belief too. Previous we were hyper local now we were a global community.
      Individual rights and freeing the mind versus religion being the society it switched the human and the god in the stack of society
      Separation of the soul and state. Birth of the individual. Replace nuclear with global family. Bring into modern era. Ironic that creating a global community led to more individualism.
- People like Aristotle and Plato started to replace religion and morality something that had been placed in religion with the idea of re examining beliefs and evolving within yourself. Men separated morals from religion for the first time ever. It went from the state was everything to we derive morals from ourselves. We need to evolve over time. These philosophers rejected cities and withdrew from the city. This emancipated the individual and strove to a universal god. Now people had obligations to themselves not the state and they had to be virtuous. Rome became a hegimon and people wanted to be Roman very badly so much so that they willingly and actively renounced allegiance to their existing city in order to gain the coveted Roman citizenship. The power of the Roman citizenship destroyed the last bits of power the municipalities still possessed. Eventually everyone was declared a Roman citizen this was a massive decree versus how society had been but at the time wasn’t met with too much fanfare which shows how much society had changed. Equality ect had degraded and the idea of one people equal under the law existed. The municipal system of antiquity had been fully destroyed by Rome. This too 600-700 years. Led in many ways to Christianity.

    - **Note:** The philosophers led to the birth of individuality and creating internal moral system not just relying on religion. They withdrew from their traditional religious ties and this lead to the dissolution of municipalities and the rise of big cities in Rome, which was the ending of the family, religion and city, replaced by the society and individuality
- After the democratization of these ancient cities there was constant civil war between the rich and poor. The poor became very poor and rebelled often without the guise of religion this pendulum of power swung across the ages. This was a constant civil war with neither side really getting what they wanted. A lot of fighting and murder with no real progress the government was no longer a democracy just a place where elected officials sold favors. It would go between liberty the rule of the rich and tyranny the elected ruler of the poor people. The system that was set up lead to despotism and created crazy authoritarian rulers who ruled with an iron fist or were assassinated. Sparta maintained authoritarian control by the rich and so while there were many attempts at revolution they were more easily crushed.

    - **Note:** In these late stage democracies it was just people grasps for power and a lot of murder. It was the rule of whoever had the most resources. Perils of democracy the rule of power not liberal games and institutional rot over time. This is the same as the Dalio and Durant quotes
- Law became something that applied to everyone not just religious decrees passed to only the patricians who were patriarchs. The law was now universal and created and could be altered by the will of the people. The laws became universally applied and was no longer class distinctions and religiously driven. Women started to obtain rights too while they were second class citizens they gained the rights of inheritance that they didn’t have under religion the public interest had replaced the old religion. No longer we’re rulers commissioned by the gods but rather by the people. The old institutions stood much long physically than effectively because while they still existed they were useless and unused. The rule of religion was replaced by the rule of wealthy people. This at first catalyzed industry but then created resentment and envy and was overthrown. Athenians had a deference to authority and as long as a man could prove his honor would allow him to speak and listen. They were intentional about debating and hearing all sides of an argument before making a decision. They not only wanted to but needed to hear all sides of an argument and weigh their merits this is how laws a decisions were made. There was a respect for the problems being difficult and a desire to use debate to suss out the answer. When someone was making a point people were quiet allowing him to fully work through his argument without interruption then after all sides had been presented and the people had debated a judge was given leway to make a decision. If a man had made multiple bad suggestions he lost his right to present and argument and the law was attached to the names of those who created it forever incentive allignment. The democratic state was very involved half your time was taken up by deliberation during the week and usually every man needed to serve as a senator and magistrate. When he voting he was pledging his money and blood to the cause intensely involved and incentive aligned true democracy is very tough.

    - **Note:** The law and old institutions had changed before the formal signs of the old institutions fell. The law used to only be for patriarchs but then a new class of wealthy land owners subverted them to take power and everyone women included could vote. Soon this rich class was subverted too.
      Democracy in Athens was intense. They believed that anyone could contribute if their ideas had merit. They were very open minded and listened to all sides of an argument and debated before making decisions. This is the perfect critical approach. The issue was they took a lot of time to do this.
      They had incentive alignment where people put their name next to bills and if those didn’t perform they had less say.
      Tie people’s names to every law, debate both sides, start up advice.
- The changes in the family became weaker and these ties led to looser ties in the city. Eventually the laws that had been sacred were archaic and there were two bodies the rich and the poor. There was no more obscure fighting the centuries of slow change had boiled over. Eventually monarchy was restored but these were known as tyrants who were not religious peoples but chosen by the people to have a rule over the people unlike in the past this was the first time people were ruled by people and not gods through people. Slowly life became less covered by the basic needs and created the arts and trade which led to a new aristocracy within the plebs. Likewise as this cultural revolution was benefiting the plebs the cavalry that had been militarily dominant due to new tech gave way to infantry which was made up of plebs so they could make money and militarily were dominant they were gaining much power. Then the plebs created a religion for themselves and rejected the ancient religion for one of their own. The plebs had rich men soldiers and priests it became impossible to keep them out of the city and they had to be let in. Sometimes there was a violent revolution other times there was a peaceful acceptance of others. I’m forming the body politic they called themselves the good and the other side the incumbents the bad. Rank was overthrown and money became the only power. In Rome the rich plebs bridged the gap between the patricians and poor plebs and slowly the societies started to merge after initial repulsion. The plebs became equal eventually under the law and even under religion. They became unrecognizably different from the patricians. The plebs had their own world and became equal with some peace some violence and some money to the patricians.

    - **Note:** Revolutions happen slowly over years then all at once. This is the anatomy of a revolution. The family and city had degraded and soon the leaders weren't religious but elected by the people.
      The basics were covered and a rich class of plebs started to form through arts and trade money became power. Likewise the military technology led to the power of infantry over cavalry. So social economic and military power had basically been overturned. It was now impossible to not integrate the city.
      Some revolutions were violent some were peaceful but the world had changed.
- Kings previously had political and military power but slowly in these ancient cities political and military power started to fade but the ones taking it left the kings in as spiritual and religious leaders. The Patricians took charge and while there was the idea of rights it was just an aristocraticy instead of a king the function of government was the same it was just an oligarc. People had votes but only the ones patricians nominated and this was replacing one ruler for another. There were kings of city states with the power and the king in the big city was just a figurehead. This first revolution was one that changed rules but only more deeply ingrained the current ways of society. The kings were cowtowing towards the poor and the aristocrats took over to maintain their power and status. Slowly the idea of primogeniture the oldest inheriting things went away and then the poor started being given more rights as the aristocrats started fighting for supreme control. This was the catalyst to the tearing down of the old institutions while the past incident had been a revolution to propagate and more deeply ingrain old institutions but the lust for power and individual desire for freedom combined to create this storm. Revolution changed exterior but not the constitution of society. It was the aristocrats seeking to cement their power. Political revolution to prevent a social revolution. Revolutions in history have no real account but happen gradually and slowly suddenly you find the customs in different centuries are different but you can’t point where the trail went awry there’s no clear moment. Slowly here the younger children got citizenship rights then the clients got those rights and the institutions were destroyed gradually. The clients were at the mercy of masters and slowly the masters had to ceed rights like land to tend and freedoms or these clients would leave because they saw there was life away from the masters so the masters had to give them concessions or lose free labor and warriors. The more freedom they got the more they wanted the beginning of the end. Slowly through being exposed to the understanding of their status did they grow to demand more and more which lead to their freedom. The idea of the gens got more and more diluted until there was nothing left.

    - **Note:** Revolutions happen slowly then all at once. The poor classes became less ignorant of their ignorance and wanted more while the kings were removed so there was a political change but this was done to keep the social order together. Revolution only happens when everyone agrees socially and the institutions that are lagging that are torn down. This is the play out of the ancient world moving to the modern one through more universal rights and individual liberty brought out by the evolution of society. Keys to power and revolutions only happen that people want to happen.

    - **Note:** Transition of power. Change cemented before it happens.
- Why and how did this social order get upset by revolutions. It starts with the lower class which was ignored by most of the new world created. The patricians had a religious standing and social standing while the plebeians had basically no right or religion or way to ascend they were forever stuck and lost. So the clients of the patrician were the servants and property of the family basically and the plebs lived outside this city hierarchy. The plebs were foreign to the religion and not part of the citizen. The clients worshiped a patrician god as a second class citizen. Plebs had to live outside the city abs couldn’t own property. The client was protected by the law through his patron while the pleb had no rights. The plebs were even lower than slaves but these men sought to rewrite the hierarchy.

    - **Note:** The anatomy of revolution. There was a group of basically slaves which were unhappy but had their place in the world and had rights but the plebs were not even viewed as people. They had no real money property or rights and they wanted to change that. They were so left out that one day they decided they were going to fashion themselves a seat at the table. That’s how revolutions start people feel unheard and left out and eventually realize they need to spark a change. Freedom is nothing left to lose. People with a place dont revolt. This is like the poor white peoples in the south loved being above the slaves so we’re happy and bought into the system more than the upper class despite being kinda fuxked by it.
- The individuals belong solely to the state and religion there was no concept of individual rights. His fortune or body was always at the service of the state. The state controlled everything in life and everyone was at the service of the state. It controlled education and mandated posts in public life. Personal opinion was allowed in votes but only within the choices optioned by the state. Liberty of religious thought was deeply impias and questioning religion was a crime punishable by death. People had liberty to exist within the state only.
- The patricians of these major cities would go about life through such a religious lens that each part of their lives to how they walked around the house to invaded a country had deep religious ties and they looked crazy superstitious. A lot of this chapter is just examples of legitimately crazy and superstitious behavior that ancient Athenians did in all areas of life that show how tied they were to religious superstition. They constantly appealed to oracles and gods for war or peace or purification or sacrifice.
    - **Tags:** #rituals, #histroical-knowledge, #human-nature-remains-constant, #religion, #superstition
    - **Note:** Religion in the old days was personal to a family and governed their life. Humans being very superstitious and ritual based. Very superstitious
- Ancient laws come directly from the gods or was not discussed but imposed by them even unanimous decision couldn’t create new laws they needed the gods approval. Laws could never be removed so often you could find contradictory laws. Laws were a religious construct and those worshiping different religions had different gods and could not be subject to the same laws even if they were neighbors strangers had no protection or rights and could now own anything because they didn’t have religious protection because they had different gods which made them lower than slaves. The idea of patriotism was reinforced by the idea of the homeland being the place of religion and the attachment was incredibly deep being excommunicated was very bad. In being excommunicated the man lost all his civil and political rights this was absolutely destructive. People from different cities could not marry. This was sacreligous and being excommunicated meant you had no place in your family they couldn’t recognize you this was often on par to death. Cities were completely foreign and they either stood sovereign or vanquished because they did different gods a conquering people couldn’t just take control of a city and make people part of the empire they needed to destroy and make them subjects as their religion did not allow for strangers. In a conquering it was custom not illegal to kill every man woman and child and burn their fields to purify the area. In a treaty often a child was sacrificed and the peace was not only between men but their gods too. When cities gods fought the people fought more brutally but when the gods were friends the cities were United.

    - **Note:** The laws came from the gods and were sacred/ could not be removed. Everyone outside of the religion was an enemy and viewed as lower than a slave very tribal.
      Excommunication was worse than being put to death in some ways because you could no longer be accepted. People from different cities and areas had no rights in the new areas and couldn’t really interact. Strong idea of patriotism
      When places were conquered the people were killed and everything was burned to the ground to purify the area. People could either integrate gods or murder each other.
      Religion was the core everything came from that very tribal.
- The ancients saw religion as rights ceremonies and exterior worship when he generally look to religion for deep internal meanings and explanations in our life. To them religion was your todo list to us it’s your spiritual guide. Men didn’t love his gods they didn’t love him. Religion in the old days bound and governed man. It was meant to be done not discussed or examined. Man appeased gods out of fear not love constantly appeasing them to bring him good fortune. Each household had a book of prayers that had kept gods at bay for their ancestors and they likewise copied these to the letter to avoid the wrath of gods. A small change to the prayers and clothes wearing during prayer ect was impiety and very bad. There was no room for error there was no innovation this was the truth figured out by ancestors and needed to be completed to the T. Things above all needed to be preserved even past the point of the words making no sense and these prayers were safe guarded by the priests. The detailed history of the entire city was scrupulous maintained but anything before that was completely neglected. They believe all acts were of the gods and you needed to record every event as it was holy. Historically kings were synonymous with high priest. These rulers were the judge military leader and religious leader. The king was a religious figure passed down through family. When there was a conqueror the old leaders we’re still viewed as the religious leaders while the military and political leaders were called tyrants which did not have a particularly bad connotation. In voting or drawing lots they believed the gods were imploring the answer with their will.

    - **Note:** The ancient concept of religion was super superstitious and very primal. Life was not something to be examined but followed. This was a very rigid way of thinking and an anti rational meme that placed men as the judge jury and executioner as the keeper of these deep family secrets and religious traditions. Anti rational religious memes preserving the past world was caked in fear and this stopped progress. These people had no good explanation for the outside world they just had religion so the appealed to gods for everything. Now we understand the natural world better so we appeal to gods for what we don’t understand which is more implicit and emotional
- Each country had their own calendar which was far from standard and revolves around religious festivals. The entire life was kept secret by priests who changed days in months to accommodate religious events. The census was created for big festivals where sacrifices were made to cleanse ills. If a stranger was there the ceremony was under threat and if a man did not show he was no longer counted among the pure citizens. They counter and wrote down everyone. These festivals if there was a bad event would be considered an act of the gods and a date where no festivals could be held because the gods weren’t with it that date. Also at these festivals the social standing in the tribe like senator or farmer was fixed. Before battle they would make sacrifices and if they were unfavorable wouldn’t fight. Likewise the religious headwear warn at festivals was also warn in the senate. Religion enveloped all parts of man’s life.

    - **Note:** The importance of rituals and religion. There was complete capture of rituals by the priests and this tribal nature of people led to excluded groups basically invalidating a religious event. The religion was unique to the tribe if you weren't there you weren't in the tribe and if you weren't supposed to be there the ritual was null. Humans are incredibly tribal and averse to change. Also concentration of power and how religion was the deepest bit of life. Social standing was fixed. This is such an interesting musing on the inherent tribalism of human nature and how power concentrates and is ineffective when divided so it was seized by these classes.
- Cities in olden times were founded not by slow accumulations but all at once in a big religious and pre planned ceremony. They needed to transplant their hearth in spirit to this new city which was very involved and the ceremonies that recount the establishment of the initial founded still into the 1800s showing old habits die hard. When a new city was founded it needed to be found with new gods and traditions even if it was the same people in the same place resettling after a military defeat became the old gods had betrayed them. A city was one big religion to their gods. The public fire was the heart of the city and any stranger within the city was a threat to the deep religious nature of it and if there were any issues while strangers were in the city they were blamed and scapegoated. When people died in a city these people had they done something notable they were seen as gods. Cities can have the same names gods or the same type god but these meant nothing for other cities if it wasn’t their god 2 cities could have 2 Zeus who did and meant different things. Their god’s protected them personally. They also hated the other places gods and would fight over them often. Even in conquering cities they would need to take their gods which could take years after the war. They saw gods as a private thing specific to a city that was needed to be kept extremely secret or risk conquest. There were holy meals with very clear direct food and dress that created a better connection with the gods.
    - **Tags:** #excommunication, #tribal-behavior, #cities, #religion, #gods, #scapegoat
    - **Note:** Cities were settled by people and religion was at the core of cities. Often a new city led to founding new gods and traditions. Religion and life were so intertwined when people died they could become gods themselves. Scapegoating and other people were seen as bad and threats to the religion very tribal.
- Man attached the divine to the intelligence of the soul and as well to physical agents that he put stake in. These opposing views of spiritual and physical coexisted and rarely had issues. The gods of Olympus and the sacred fire. The dogmas faded but the physical principals remained the same. Each minds of these religions came up with their own gods but with similar ideas like sun god with different names. Societies and religions only grew as the religious areas allowed them to ceed and gain more of a foothold in society. Man first lives isolated and as many grew his gods grew with him. The gods were the beliefs of man and these had to scale up for cities to emerge and they only did when this point has been reached.
    - **Tags:** #religion, #scale-trust, #ancient-history
    - **Note:** Man used religion as society scaled to create trust. Religion was both spiritual in the soul and physical like the sun. Religion scaled trust.
- There were gens which were similar to families in that they all had some far flung god in common that had been passed down through the men in the family. These gens were seen as pseudo families and while they could hold their own courts in public they had to fully support members of their gen. This was a larger level of family worship emergence. The word gens is the same as genius which is family association. This idea is that they all come from a singular relative who is now a god and worshiping a man who was not related would be seen as impiety. The gens have names that go back many generations like Claudius and then after some time a piece of of that clan would divide into scippio so the clan would be Claudius scippio and a worshiper of both gods. Based on our knowledge it seems that religion developed together in a common place then people went to Greece and India ect. And formed political ideologies and ones of private property that were in line with these religious ideals. These nuclear families grew and the religious and social codes weren’t written but understood. When a slave would come into the family they would be baptized in the soul of the family and buried with them because no one not in the religion could live on the religious grounds. So slaves were like adopted or married in people ie part of the family. In this action he was always subordinate to the religion and could be freed but given his religious bond would always be bound to the family.

    - **Note:** This is the traditional concept of the family as gens and how it was very tribal. You were part of a gens, then a sub gens and even slaved had to be adopted into the gens just to get allowed on the land. Slaves were a part of the family and the gens had a set of gods and customs that others gens didn’t. Gens were purely tribal and religion family ideals everything came from this oldest conception of organization. This breeds our tribalism now. Tribes were more likely to survive than people. Common roots of all humans coming from one place then branching out to form different religions. Arc of human history.
      Concept of the family and roots of tribalism
- Morals of the ancient family. History doesn’t study facts and institutions alone but should aim to study the human mind and how it thinks and believes thought and felt and how it evolves through time. Because men had their family religion other men were literally nothing to them and completely unimpressed even possible enemies. If there was adultery the bastard could not be buried in the sacred hearth of the family because it would make the fire impure and destroy peace in the afterlife for every generation destroying the family. The idea of piety is vital which underlies deep respect relationships in families the mother and son had key rituals in family religions and in the after life the son was set to worship the father as a god and the father to achieve peace needed his son to constantly do this. This creates very strong family bounds and to the religion. In this religion the house was the church the place of worship and had a special place in every family’s heart that other families could not comprehend as other family gods were irrelevant.
- The Greek and Roman’s called the head of the household the father. This man didn’t have to bear kids or be a certain age. If an older man died his younger son even if unmarried would become the father. The mother couldn’t go home because she was pledged to these gods but she had no right to this absolute power position in the household. This power position was the mark of a man’s leadership within his own house and religion. His is the supreme chief religious authority and judge. The rights of any city were subservient to these private family rights. Property was seen not as an individual but a family right and so only this father in the family had power and if he sold to his son he sold to himself so it was forbidden. If he gave up his son for labor that was still his property and this was not slavery. Likewise if his wife or son did something bad he was directly responsible and had to appear in court not them. The husband could kill his wife and child and the state could do nothing as it was the fathers right. The father was subject to the state laws. The man was still bound by his ancient religion so he wasn’t free to do as he wished because he had a spiritual duty.
- The idea of property was complex some people owned the land but not the crops still others owned the crops and not the land but the idea of property rights was prevalent in some way always. The idea of kinship was not through birth but through your pledging to specific family gods to the point where brother and sister were unrelated but some adopted person and that sister were next of kin. His thesis is that the gods coming from the dead were planted in the ground and apart of the earth so moving from traveling to more static could’ve been a religious thing because they were tied to their unique sacred land so they started building dwellings. The land was literally sacred and they believed if anyone were to do something like step on or displace the land they were to be struck down killed and have their land destroyed. Property was interlocked with the domestic religion. The land was sacred to a family so you couldn’t even sell it because an individual did not in his lifetime have control over the gods and this sacred place. To sell is sacrelig. It was easy to make a man a servant in Rome than take his property. Because the man was seen as the religious leader of the house the property would pass to him with all its responsibilities and debts because that was seen as a part of the deeper religious order of the lives these people lived. Women would leave marry and adopt other gods so they could not inherit this land and keep it sacred. All the Greek Roman ect laws were the same because they came from the same religious base. If there was no male the daughter can marry the next of kin and carry the religious energy through her. Having mothers who were sisters didn’t make you related you only passed through the male.
- Marriage was seen as a welcoming of the wife into a full religion of the family and rejecting the past religion of her birth family. This was an involved and solem occasion consecrated by the eating of cake. The idea of marriage was to keep the domestic worship going and stopping this was sacreligious so celibacy was seen as a literal crime in early civilizations and the marriage was so intense and important than divorce or polygamy wasn’t contemplated to much of a degree. However if one was sterile the man must leave his wife or the wife must take up the mama brother so they could keep the religion this was a duty. Adoption could be undertaken like a marriage where the adopted had to renounce his family gods and accept new ones and was seen as a last option when kids were not beared.

    - **Note:** The origins of marriage were very serious and some of the traditions still exist today but these were deeply rooted in religion and life of the family marriage was a duty and ceremonies like cake were practiced for a while. Path dependence in society.
- This book takes the view that human nature is unchanging and seeks to look through history to glean insights to core human nature. The rights of burial were vital and it believed this gave peace to the dead and was needed so much so that when generals didn’t bury their dead in ancient Athens after a victory they themselves were put to death. Belief that we lived in our bodies even after death. The idea of literally feeding the dead was something observed for maybe 1000 or longer years before the Greeks and Roman’s and was a pre cursor to afterlife thinking. Every year people would give tribute to the dead. The idea of death and worshiping the dead as gods was something done by cultures East and west for a very long time. Good or bad everyone was seen as a god like being in death. Likewise across these cultures there was a sacred fire held in high regard and tended to daily. It could only go out when your whole family had died and was usually lit using sunlight or rubbing sticks. These traditions being so similar can likely be traced back to early man who first invented these and then was continued by descendants so this is essential to human nature. All gods started as family only gods passed only paternal in ritual and spirit so this was a hype local religion where everyone’s gods were different and unique to a family. This religion believed men we central to creation and worship and this may have lead to the patrilineal laws that were created.
