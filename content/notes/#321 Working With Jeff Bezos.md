  Speaker 1
  And what makes this book so special and what I really want to focus on today, obviously Jeff's brilliant. He's going to have a lot of fascinating and genius level insights, but he also explains the reason behind his insights. So he says, when I write about what led Jeff to making key decisions in this book, I can do so because I often directly asked him for his specific thinking behind his insights. And the reasoning behind them was often more illuminating than the insights themselves. And as that be like Howard Hughes story illustrates, Jeff is a masterful communicator. He's able to identify a handful of principles are important to him in the building of his company. And then he finds ways to teach those principles and to repeat those principles for everybody inside the company. And so they make the point at the very beginning of a company, the founder is the culture, the founder is the one that's teaching everybody the principles. So it says Amazon open for business in July 1995, staffed by a handful of people handpicked by Jeff Bezos. He decided that getting in on the growth of the internet was a once in a lifetime opportunity. So he gave up his lucrative and promising career. He wanted to create a new and compelling experience for customers. So there's just a few things to get started, few traits to get started. One, hand pick core, two, try to find and pursue a once in a lifetime opportunity. And then the third thing that he's going to repeat over and over again for the next 20 years is that a company can be a fast follower, they can copy, they can imitate or they can innovate. He repeats over and over again Amazon is here to innovate. We are here to create new and compelling experiences that did not yet exist. The hands on nature of Jeff Bezos at the beginning and really throughout the entire book cannot be understated. In the very early days of the company, when it consisted of a handful of people working in a three small rooms, there was no formal leadership principles because Jeff was the leadership Principles. He wrote the job descriptions. He interviewed the candidates. He packed in ship boxes and read every email that went out to customers. Taking part in every aspect of the business allowed him to communicate the Amazon philosophy informally to the relatively small group of employees. Jeff was never shy about how he wanted things done. And he began to instill guiding principles like customer obsession and unrelentingly high standards into every small step his team took. Jeff had one simple rule. It has to be perfect. He'd remind his team that one bad customer experience would undo the goodwill of hundreds of perfect ones. So if you've ever read Jeff's shareholder letters, you already know these principles. He identified them from the very beginning and repeats them over and over again. I made I think three episodes now on Jeff's shareholder letters. I'll leave them all linked in the show notes if you haven't listened to them. But the principles he would repeat are customer obsession, innovation, frugality, personal ownership, bias for action, high standards, under promising and over delivering. In fact, talks about in the book that the fact he would proofread all the customer service emails. And so one thing that he wanted to do at the very beginning speaking of under promising and over delivering is when you go to buy something on the website, you know, they'd say, hey, we're Going to send this us postal first class mail. You might get it in about a week. ([Time 0:05:37](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1f6ed94b-d385-4ede-b163-32c8ea1bcf63))
    - **Note:** Jeff had high standards left his very good job to pursue the exponential tech of the internet he wasn’t there to be a fast follower but to create and innovate. Hand picked core team going after once in a lifetime opportunity. Jeff was hands on and implemented his principles at the company every day bias for action frugality innovation personal ownership under promise over deliver high standards and customer obsession. He would constantly under promise and obsrvdeliver giving free upgrades for first class shipping that delighted his customers. Thinks speeds matters in business and that’s a competitive advantage. Instead of beuracracy he develops the concept of single threaded leadership where one person only and completely owns a project. That person is working on one thing only. Same for theil at PayPal giving everyone a single different job function which gets rid of dependencies and increases focus. Limit dependencies and coordination. Loosely coupled coordination through apis and machines not emails. Remove dependencies and move in parallel which leads to more experimenting and building/ creation. It’s easier to break things and rerack than go slow. Limiting factor to anything is great leaders and deep focus. Agency and ownership is vital.
- The Importance of Great Leadership for Success
  Key takeaways:
  - Brilliant managers are notoriously difficult to find in sufficient numbers, even at Amazon.
  - Great team leaders are rare and the limiting factor is great leadership.
  - To succeed, great leaders must work on their role full time.
  - Inventing something as a part-time job is the best way to fail.
  - The single-threaded leader model helps establish ownership and accountability.
  - Jeff Bezos and Peter Thiel evaluate leaders based on one thing only.
  - Jeff Bezos found unique ideas by reading papers and books and having conversations.
  - The whole world can be a classroom for learning and idea generation.
  - Newly hired Amazon employees are surprised by the eerie silence in meetings.

  Speaker 1
  We were able to identify some brilliant managers. They turned out to be notoriously difficult to find in sufficient numbers, even at Amazon. Great team leaders proved to be rarities. Another way to think about that is great. Anything is rare. The limiting factor here is great leadership. And then the second part of that is they have to work on this full time. They cannot do anything else. This is just a fantastic line on why the best way to fail and inventing something is by making it somebody's part time job. And so the problem that they were trying to solve and the vision they had was how to move faster remove dependencies. But what they also realized once this was in place that ownership and accountability are much easier to establish under the single threaded leader model. And why? Because Jeff Bezos, just like Peter Teal, are only evaluating that person on one thing and one thing only. Another unique idea and the way to build and run Amazon that Jeff came up with, he actually found this idea in a paper and then decided to use it. So it's something I'm going to repeat over and over again. You've heard me saying on past podcast, but if you're paying attention, the whole world is a classroom. You'll be shocked. If you go to this book, you'll be shocked at how many ideas Jeff got from reading a paper, reading a book, having a conversation that he used inside of Amazon. If you're paying attention, the whole world is a classroom. So says if you were asked recently hired Amazon employees, what is surprised the most in their time at the company so far? One response would certainly top the list, the eerie silence in the first 20 minutes of many meetings. ([Time 0:16:27](https://share.snipd.com/snip/743c7128-ddef-4a82-98c3-a17e9c9bc90e))
    - **Note:** The whole world is a classroom. Makes people read a memo for 20 minutes before this meeting. High resolution hand outs over power points. Jeff also believed in a shared knowledge base in the company. Jeff banned PowerPoint and forced short memos. People who are successful are curious about the world and lifelong learners and are constantly reading until the day they die. Jeff assumes the sentence he’s reading is wrong and then proves it for himself in his head and gets a lot of insights this way. Narrative structure is better to run a meeting. Work backwards from client experience to what you need to do to achieve that. Go from the product to the plan. Don’t sell the opportunity come first with mock ups then abstract from there. Jeff wanted to know how each part of the mock up would work in the real world. Half baked mock up create half baked products. You would need to in a memo present pricing features and customer experience you could not present a product without thinking everything through. He is the forcing function think of the product as a press release inversion for the product. Working backwards is vital and you need constraints. Create forcing functions for products to create an optimal experience limit the press release to one page to distill thinking and produce the most important features.
- The Role of Belief Systems and Customer Obsession in Amazon's Success
  Key takeaways:
  - Jeff frequently uses ideas from other companies and books to help improve Amazon.
  - The founder's belief system acts as the language of the company and is often written down and repeated.
  - The belief system is also expressed through the founder's actions.
  - Jeff made every person in the company, including himself, work customer service to obsess over customers.
  - Combining data and anecdotes is important and powerful when in sync.
  - Customer Connection is a mandatory program at Amazon where corporate employees become customer service agents.
  - Jeff himself participates in the Customer Connection program.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I wanted to go back to this idea that the whole world is a classroom. And you can't help but notice how many times Jeff is just using ideas from other companies or from things that he's reading and he's using them inside of Amazon, right? He's using them as a metaphor to use it to help his company perform better. But I was also struck by this idea while I was reading this book that you could think of the belief system of the founder as the language of the company. That is why it's usually written down and repeated over and over again. And it definitely is the case in Amazon. But you also see the belief system of the founder express through their actions. And so this idea that Jeff identified with from day one that we're going to obsess over customers, he'd make every single person in the company, including himself, work customer service, Actually take calls. And so I love this. And there's a lot of good ideas here, including the importance of combining data and anecdotes data and anecdotes make a powerful combination when they're in sync. And they're valuable check on one another when they're not. The most powerful anecdote in this regard features Jeff himself. Amazon has a program called customer connection, which is mandatory for corporate employees. Every two years, the corporate employee is required to become a customer service agent for a few days. They have to listen in on calls, watch email and chat interactions, and then handle some customer contacts directly. Jeff is not exempted from this program. While I was working as his shadow, it came time for his customer connection recertification. ([Time 0:30:14](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e72c0385-87f0-46ad-8226-e5e51bd6a342))
    - **Note:** The company is the belief system of the founder. Amazon was customer focused so Jeff made everyone work in customer service including him once a year to engrain this belief. In Toyota once someone realizes a problem they’re obligated to stop production so it can be investigated at a deeper level. Jeff saw how in customer service they would get calls for issues that the customer reps could anticipate and so Jeff empowered these people to raise their hands and fix the problem on the spot. Cross disciplinary thinking learning from others and empowering people. Cut off at the source. Failure and invention are tied to each other and Jeff hated failure but embraced it because he wanted Amazon to be an invention first company. Long term orientation and working backwards doesn’t give up on important initiatives that don’t pick up steam because they’re building for the long term. Only build where differentiation matters. Don’t build with a skills forward approach but working backwards starts with needs and fill in skills which is better.
- The Importance of Choosing the Right Leader for Digital Media
  Key takeaways:
  - A single-threaded leader named Steve was appointed to run digital media.
  - The first action was not focused on what product to build, but on how to organize the team and who was the right leader.
  - Amazon had limited financial resources and had to rely on frugality to compete with larger players.
  - Jeff Bezos emphasized the importance of adapting to shifting consumer needs, citing Kodak's failure as a cautionary example.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  He appointed a single threaded leader which is the guy Steve from the Howard Hughes story at the very beginning. So you have a single threaded leader named Steve to run digital who would report directly to Jeff so that they could work together to formulate a vision and a plan for digital media. And I love the explanation of this. I'm going to read the whole paragraph to you because I think it's so great. In other words his first action was not a what decision. It was a who and a how decision. This is an incredibly important difference. Jeff did not jump straight to focusing on what product to build which seems like the straightest line from A to B. Instead the choices he made suggest that he believed that the scale of the opportunity was large and the scope of the work required to achieve success was equally large and complex. He focused first on how to organize the team and who was the right leader to achieve the right result. At that time Amazon did not have billions of dollars to spend on digital media or anything else for that matter. So we would need to lean heavily on the frugality principle to stay in the game with the bigger players. Jeff was a student of history and regularly reminded us that if a company didn't or couldn't change and adapt to meet shifting consumer needs it was do remember he's got a transition His business from 70% physical goods to essentially all digital. And he used the example of Kodak's failure to do so as a warning sign. You don't want to become Kodak he would say referring to the once mighty photography giant that had missed a turn from film to digital. ([Time 0:39:45](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ad037ece-613e-4e60-baec-f30a29c81abf))
    - **Note:** Jeff meets with Steve jobbs and sees the iTunes Store he realizes that selling cds will be dead instead of trying to copy jobs he starts building a system for digital media who will then focus on which markets to attack. Instead of starting with the knee jerk response he steps back and sees the future is digital and the market will be large and he attacks that. You can invent or copy they choose to invent Jeff was laser focused on innovation not replication and he is wanted to attack markets this is where the kindle came from. He realized books were going away and he needed to make it digital. Any product needs to be a uniquely differentiated or he won’t build it. The forces him to look beyond music looked beyond digital music and does ebooks the only value creation is through invention. Jeff saw the future was in ebooks but just offering every book was undifferentiated so they needed to create something more this lead them as a pure e-commerce compeny into building hardware. Reading Jeff is like learning the high growth tech business playbook before any of the books were written
- The Controversy of Amazon Becoming a Hardware Company
  Key takeaways:
  - The idea of Amazon becoming a hardware company was controversial.
  - Amazon's decision to become a hardware device manufacturer influenced future decisions.
  - Outsourcing in a business area with little internal expertise can be a mistake.
  - Retailers who outsourced e-commerce lacked the ability to innovate and differentiate.
  - Amazon had the ability to ideate and test new products quickly.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  But back then, this is how this is why he's so special. The idea that Amazon, a pure e-commerce distributor of retail products made by others, which is what they were at this time. The idea that Amazon, a pure e-commerce distributor of retail products made by others would become a hardware company and sell its own reader device was controversial. The Kindle chapter in this book is incredible. I'm still in it. Not enough myself, I wrote in the margin actually. Outsourced and your company doesn't acquire the skills. Amazon wants the skills. What does that mean? Our decision to become a hardware device manufacturer would inform a number of decisions down the road. Many companies that decide to enter a business area in which they have little internal expertise are capability, which is what Amazon doesn't have a description of Amazon at this time, Right? They choose to outsource. This can sometimes be a mistake. And they use an example in the early days of e-commerce, brick and mortar retailers created their first online retail sites. They brought in third party developers. This approach enabled them to move quickly, but it deprived them of the flexibility to innovate and differentiate. And that's a big problem because who had that ability to differentiate and innovate and who are now these brick and mortar retailers going online and competing directly against Amazon. We know how that ends. Retailers who outsourced e-commerce lack the ability to ideate and test new products. And so they list a bunch of products that Amazon was able to test way fast because they had this ability. ([Time 0:46:05](https://share.snipd.com/snip/016aa665-07d8-496e-ae1c-31e5ab54a5c7))
    - **Note:** Jeff unsourced he didn’t outsource. Outsourcing is better to get to market but insourcing is better to build the long term muscles so Jeff chose that always. Innovations build skills over products and this helps them win over the long term. Don’t acquire products acquire skills. It’s much harder to do this but founders force the issue which leads them to win over time. Be patient and long term thinking. It took 5 years post jobs meeting to create the kindle but it created a key organizational skill that was vital to growth. Run to where the ball is going. Invested in shorter shipping that lead to prime. Hates mediocrity acquire skills and grow. What’s good for stakeholders and shareholders is the same over the long term. Jeff was told they could either be fast and expensive or slow and cheap Jeff started with fast cheap he didn’t just pick one then worked to build it. Jeff walked the store meaning he would spend a couple hours on the weekend using the product to understand the UX. Then he would send ideas to the product teams who would need to give him answers. When the meeting on prime got cancelled Friday due to system issues Jeff rescheduled it to Saturday morning at his house. Prime was building a moat around the best customers. Jeff realized video subscription wasn’t working so they just added it to prime to jumpstart it and they realized content was king they couldn’t acquire it they had to build it.
- The Birth of AWS: Identifying Undifferentiated Heavy Lifting and the Power of a Metaphor
  Key takeaways:
  - A realization that they didn't want to continually compete with Netflix and Hulu and pay additional fees for content.
  - The decision to create their own movies and TV shows to differentiate themselves.
  - The belief that the world is a classroom and the importance of working backwards from the optimal customer experience.
  - The concept of 'undifferentiated heavy lifting' and the opportunity it presented for AWS.
  - The value of powerful metaphors in guiding product development.
  - A recommendation to buy the book mentioned in the podcast to support the show.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And so they realized like, we don't want to be in this never ending cycle of bidding against Netflix and Hulu. We don't want to keep paying the studios more additional fees for every country that they enter. And there's all these issues that they go into detail. And so again, they're like, well, if you wanted to be truly differentiated, what would you do? And once they asked themselves that question, it says that led to a startling conclusion. We had to create our own content. It was time to make our own movies and TV shows. And I just want to share one more idea that I think ties a lot of these ideas that you and I've been talking about today together. The world is a classroom. We're going to differentiate. We're not going to copy. We're going to work backwards from the optimal customer experience. And we're going to use a written narrative to guide product development. Jeff and I attended an O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference. And we went to a panel featuring Stewart Butterfield, who co-founded Flickr and later Slack. Someone asked Stewart to describe a typical day at Flickr. His answer was surprising. He said that about half the day was probably the same as it was for many the people in the audience, scrambling to keep their technology platform one step ahead of the rapid growth of their Business. They worked on scaling their databases, web servers, software, and hardware half the day, right? Stewart said they did not spend as much time as he would like on innovating things that were unique to Flickr. After the panel, Jeff and I had a brief chat about Stewart's comments. We both noticed the same thing. A phenomenon that Amazon would later refer to as undifferentiated heavy lifting. That is, the tasks that we could do for the companies that would enable them to focus on what made them unique. This was an opportunity. The kernel for the opportunity for AWS, obviously. In building and operating one of the world's largest websites, we had acquired a core competency only a few other companies could match. Working backwards documents for the early AWS products, the PR FAQ stated that we wanted the student in a dorm room to have access to the same world class computing infrastructure as Any Amazon software engineer. That powerful metaphor in the PR FAQ document really helped crystallize the thoughts and ideas of the AWS product development teams. And that is where I'll leave it. No brainer. Absolute no brainer to buy this book. I'd buy this book for yourself, for a bunch of people on your team. If you buy the book using the link that's in the show that's in your podcast player, you'll be supporting the podcast at the same time. ([Time 0:56:54](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d55ec9a0-ef8e-495e-82d7-c10d8b8f4808))
    - **Note:** The world is a classroom work backwards and differentiate. They realized they had a core competence around servers and everyone had the same issue this lead to the unique differentiation from AWS.
