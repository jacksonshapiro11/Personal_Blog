The weak link is what snaps you. Don’t reach for yield. You can always tell someone to go to hell tomorrow take time don’t be rash. World driven by envy not greed. Over time you get the reputation you deserve. A brand is a promise. Figure out what you don’t want and avoid it. Choose your hero’s carefully. Do what you enjoy no substitute for interest. Stay within your circle of competence. Don’t work with assholes you should only need a 1 page contract. Work with passionate people. Life isn’t a green room go for it. The time to act is now. Munger has the best 30 second mind ever. Don’t argue with people who’s ideas you know are stupid. Wise people step on big troubles early.

Communicate the decision to someone and the reasons behind it clearly. Tell who to do what and why. People need to know the why or they’ll never do that what the right way.

- Explain something to an orangutan. Explaining and organizing thoughts is vital to learning even of the listener isn’t listening.
  Interest rates are to businesses like gravity is to an Apple. When they’re low things float out of control but when they’re high they plummet down to earth.
  Buffet wants to hit the fat pitches he may think an investment is worth 85b or 105bn but he doesn’t care if it’s selling for 35. Prepare for a range of outcomes. Learning is not memorizing learning is changing behavior.
  A Bull market is like sex it feels best right before it ends. Wall Street never changes because It’s just humans and human nature never changes. They don’t have a plan just act and react.

    - **Note:** Human nature never changes. True learning is when you change your behavior. Explain something very simplified is the mark of true understanding also just expressing your ideas is very valuable even if it is to a monkey. Human nature is cyclical. Interest rates are like gravity. Think probabilistically range of outcomes circle of competence margin of safety.
      Innovation is behavior change much like learning is the productization of a discovery. Probabilistic thinking. Explain thinking. Cycles in human nature.
- Most important idea is I focus and frugality the moat is built by execution. Why your Mothe build an enduring competitive advantage and expand constantly eventually everyone gets fat and happy. 
  Competitive advantage comes from practice and going into a field where you’re very passionate and skilled without much competition. Charlie likes competing with idiots. 
  Get a little wiser every day. Macro opinions are useless good business with good people.
