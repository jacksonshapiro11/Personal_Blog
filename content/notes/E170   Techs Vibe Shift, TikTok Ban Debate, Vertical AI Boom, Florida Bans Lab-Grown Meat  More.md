  Speaker 2
  Yeah, you you could be happy in life But free bird. I just love Of those quotes, uh Maybe some thoughts about suffering and how hard it is you're back in the ceo seat How's that been going for you generally speaking? How hard is it? Compared to being a capital allocator curious i was going to talk to you about that offline anyway I probably have an unhealthy affinity for suffering.
  Speaker 1
  I think that if you come from Certain backgrounds you're sort of trained that that's the place That your unconscious tends to want to be And I think that that also some people call it chips On shoulders Some people call it motivation. I mean look at your friend elon How much suffering he puts his himself through I think it's a requisite to to greatness is you have to really find ways to sacrifice now if i've said this A lot There's a reason a lot of people that have had success in their career Don't end up being great entrepreneurs because as soon as you're faced with failure for the first time It doesn't Pattern match to what's happened to you historically I go to a good school. I get good grades. I go to stanford. I get a degree Everything about every step you do you're told if you do x you will get y And then you do x and you get y and you repeat And at some point you're considered successful in your Education in your career and so on If you then decide that entrepreneurship is the path for you You realize that entrepreneurship is that there is no if x then why? There is if x Maybe y maybe z maybe a hundred other things that'll smack you in the face And that experience is shockingly different for people that have historically followed a path Of success Of what's defined as success culturally socially And I think that that's really what he's speaking to If you've grown up where all of your expectations have not been met or Many of the expectations have not been met You realize that persistence grit perseverance relentlessness These are the necessary traits to be successful in entrepreneurship And I think that I find myself much happier in that condition than in any other condition And it's why i'm i'm actually very happy in the work i'm doing right now Yeah, I I think it that resonates
  Speaker 2
  A lot with me and all the entrepreneurs that I back They all have that chip And you got to be careful not to get caught up in the trappings and really focus on solving problems If you think About what a ceo does all day you hire the smartest team you know You give them the biggest challenges as much autonomy as you can And then they return back to you with all the problems the Smartest people you could find to join your team can't fix so then your life becomes essentially You know, what's left over that is the most brutal to solve and you know, there's only A certain percentage of people who can do that day in and day out just relentlessly be face Reconcile how do you reconcile that statement?
  Speaker 1
  Jason with The proposition that people should become entrepreneurs generally I think that this really res this really challenges me whenever people say i'm thinking about starting A company My first response is no don't Like you have to be told over and over again to not start a company To test if they actually have the resilience and grit necessary just to take the First step of starting the company I have caution that everyone should be encouraged to start a company and entrepreneurism is a is a career choice I think is a false notion.
  Speaker 2
  I think that most people are not psychologically equipped for being successful in entrepreneurship Yeah, you're 100 right and i've gotten in my later years as we run like found university Of these programs when people are applying and we only accept 10% into the programs and then only invest in 10% of those so net net like less than 1% get funded You know, i'll ask them they're Like, oh, can you give us money so I can get a co-founder And i'm like, you know what you felt the first test of being an entrepreneur You know the first test of being an entrepreneur is can You convince two or three people to go on this crazy journey with you? Because it's important and without money and you know people expect Oh, you're going to just give them the money because they have an interesting idea and then I asked them what's your Skill? What do you do at the startup? Do you sell the product? Do you build the product and a lot of people do not have the Wherewithal to add a skill that the world needs Being a developer a UX designer a salesperson whatever it is, right? They don't have any skill And then they also have no ability to convince somebody else with skills to start a company You if you if you can't have marketable important skills yourself That you taught yourself on your own Through sheer force of motivation and will and opening up youtube which really isn't a hard people Like anybody can learn to code to be a UX designer To be a salesperson all this is on Some online course some book some youtube video some podcast So just learn some marketable skills that a startup needs and if you can't do that you shouldn't
  Speaker 1
  Be a founder I think the point is that Everybody's capable of being a founder and anybody can and should start a company It's just that very few can finish a company and that is the resilience Part where There's just so many ups and downs and you have to be able to roll and survive And you have to just problem-solve constantly and yeah, there are very few people that are cut up For it You have to be comfortable with failure. You have to be comfortable with expectations not being met That's the important point that he's making. I can't tell you how important it was early in my career I had several cold calling jobs where I called called college kids. I called called alumni I called called CEOs. I had three different cold calling jobs and getting rejection after rejection Failing in my life. I didn't get into any schools except for Berkeley Because Berkeley didn't take teacher recommendations Teachers. I did not do well in school and then playing poker taught me a lot Because playing poker you you lose hands. You lose hands. You lose hands. You lose hands You have to just make sure that you're making the right decisions and over time the money will come to you the positive ev will be there But failure and persisting through Failure. I think was one of the most important Traits I had to develop before I was even ready to start a company because all that's happening every day is failure But I had my first magazine.
  Speaker 2
  I didn't understand I had just printed photocopies up and I had like 2,000 copies of this magazine Silicon Island reporter and I didn't know how to get them in people's hands. So I just got a luggage cart Like a literal luggage cart. I put them in the luggage cart and I walked around lower Manhattan and I just Dropped them off at internet companies and I dropped them off at cafes and then I went to all the village voice Boxes and I just slotted them in in between the village voice and miraculously people found it And then they would subscribe and you know, whatever it took was the approach.
