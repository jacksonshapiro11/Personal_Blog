### Highlights

- The Value of a Services Business
  Summary:
  It's ultimately about the value that you're able to add. Ultimately, this is a services business. We may get disrupted by AI ourselves as we are a services company. And hopefully we've earned that through our founders references. That's the core value we have in a process where a new founder is trying to decide if it's worth working with us or someone else.

  And that's a high threshold. That's true. And hopefully we've earned that through our founders references. That's the core value we have in a process where a new founder is trying to decide if it's worth working with someone like us or someone that may be less expensive, so to speak. It's ultimately about the value that you're able to add. Ultimately, this is a services business. And perhaps to the earlier conversation, we may get disrupted by AI ourselves as we are a services company. But that's ultimately what it is. There's also a third category of companies where there's a negative sort where we're investing in stuff that we get the ownership, but it's not necessarily a great company. The reality is it's a portfolio. There's examples of all of that in our portfolio. If you invest with that mindset and you do it over time and you do it in a disciplined way without deploying too much too quickly or too little too quickly, then hopefully you win.
  Speaker 2
  I think you hit on the key point, which really is a theme of this whole episode. I think I didn't know going in, we would maybe tie these two things together, but it's value. Right? Like, where's the value? Are you disciplined enough to invest in it? Do you not dilute your own value?
  Speaker 1
  Yeah. How do you charge for the value? If there's one key takeaway, I also hadn't really thought about that coming in, but the biggest issue with the Giniai startup landscape right now is that people are not thinking about the value they're creating. They're not focused on that. They're focused on the technology. And if you just start with the core principle of like, in my business, what is the desperate problem I'm solving and how much value am I creating and solving it? That helps clarify your thinking.

    - **Note:** Focus on the value you are creating. Start with value.
