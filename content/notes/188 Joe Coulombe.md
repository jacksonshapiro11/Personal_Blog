  Caesar, an entrepreneur who started without power, Ortega says, human life by its very nature has to be dedicated to something. An enterprise glorious or humble, a destiny, illustrious or trivial. So in Caesar's case, it's the state the state begins when groups naturally divided find themselves obliged to live in common. This obligation implies an impelling purpose, a common task, which is set before the dispersed group. Before all, the state is a plan of action and a program of collaboration. So those are the two most important terms, a plan of action and a program of collaboration. The men are called upon so that together they may do something it is pure dynamism, the will to do something in common. Okay, so that's the end of Ortega's words. Now this is what Joe says about that. Most of my career has been spent selling plans of action and programs of collaboration, whether to Rexall to start up Pronto markets or Bank of America to buy out Pronto or landlords Or vendors, many of whom were skeptical if not hostile to my plans and above all to my employees. If you want to know what differentiates me from most managers, that's it. From the beginning, thanks to Ortega, ([Time 0:39:09](https://share.snipd.com/snip/bb0b372f-6bb0-4312-bb0b-40bffac2e256))
    - **Note:** Human life needs a concept of purpose he learned this from Caesar and Julio Ortega. Joe was very well educated. The state is a plan of action and a program of collaboration joevtook a cue from these people and understood he needed to sell everyone on his vision. Communication of the plan and galvinazation above all. Success in business rests on the minute reading of the industry rules. Kobe did this when he read the referees handbook. Kobe understood the rules and where the refs could and couldn’t see so he could get away with more. He gets into wine and decides to buy an old licsence instead to getting a new cheaper one because the grandfather values gave him much more flex which was key to his success. This wine selling is the first foray into the Trader Joe’s plan of selling to overeducated and underpaid people. He prefers small teams and stores not growth for the sense of growth. Joe took his ideas on advertising for the private Trader Joe’s magazine from Ogilvy. They talked about why they were differentiated what’s ordinary to you is extraordinary to others.

  No better business to run than a cult. Trader Joe's became a cult of the over educated and underpaid, partly because we deliberately tried to make it a cult. And partly because we kept the implicit promises with our clientele. There are not many cult retailers who successfully retain their cult status over a long period of time. And that's just a whole point about not optimizing just for size. And this is the contrast here. But so not many successfully large retailers are going to hold their cult status, right? And part of that is because as you grow, the larger you get, the harder it is to actually keep your promises, your implicit promises to your foundation, like what created the enthusiastic Customers have created the cult and begin with. But across America and every town, there's a particular donut shop, pizza parlor, bakery, bar, et cetera, that has a cult following of true believers. Be aware of ever betraying the true believers. So another thing I learned from Danny Meyer, he's sitting next to he's complaining about something. Or maybe I think he was like venting to there's a guy from I find his name was Stanley Marcus. There's a guy from the Neiman Marcus retailer and the family. And he, you know, why am I why am I winging it? I can just look up the quote real quick. This is from Danny Mark Danny Marcus, Danny Meyer's ([Time 0:49:39](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e823b402-3a6a-43a2-9e09-21f6b662d1c8))
    - **Note:** Trader Joe’s deliberately tried to create and cultivate Trader Joe’s as a cult. Bewhere of violating the trusts of your true believers. Success is a road of mistakes well handled. Innovation is not a result of intellect but will. Business is creative problem solving 
      He came up with the idea for retailing after the industry was deregulated by going back to the 1400s original definition of buying things whole and cutting them up this became this strategy. The idea of retailing was like cheese you buy a wheel and you sell the pieces. Economies of scale. Also he insourced only when all the other stores outsourced to cpg. They reduced skus hours and decisions which were tenants of retail but delivered great value so their customers loved them. He rejected all the rules of the game for unique differentiation. He rethought the industry bottoms up not take accepted wisdom. People will always love good value and quality. Creates word of mouth marketing Would rather not be competitive but invent his own game. Limit the amount of details and make it perfect not price at all costs. Never took discounts in foods and never made decisions by committee. He sold his life’s work and regretted it. He was not sad he could’ve sold for more but that he lost agency over his baby and that killed him.
