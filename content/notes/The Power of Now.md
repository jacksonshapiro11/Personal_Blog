### Highlights

- Surrender doesn’t transform what is but just you. Illness is a state of form we can surrender to the aspects of an illness like discomfort while reshaping the story we tell ourselves about the illness to reshape our mind. Don’t attach the image but if you become friendly towards it it’ll become friendly towards you. Don’t blame the illness or yourself don’t feel like you’re guilty or have failed just accept and surrender transform it into positive presence. Like an alchemist turning negatives into positives. When something negative happens and provides you an opportunity to transform suffering into happiness, which is the greatest success of mindfulness. You may not have happiness but an inner peace and feeling of immortality. When you resist an outside event you create pain but you can not avoid the pain and accept your internal conditions allow the pain or loneliness to manifest and be felt before accepting a deep inner peace and resurrecting yourself.

    - **Note:** Transform pain by surrendering living in it. Rejecting pain leads to more pain. Embracing the situation and viewing it for all its good and bad a radically accepting and being present in it. Don’t give agency and let the bad over come you or blame it just accept it. 
      Resistance is unhappiness. Accept and transforming pain is the highest calling of humanity. Move through pain by being present in our suffering and surrendering
- Whiteness and embrace without labeling then watch as you turn suffering into peace. When pain is felt you must face it you can’t escape from it so you must accept it there is no way out but not a way through don’t give agency to the event but accept that feeling of immense pain don’t let the mind take you over and make you a victim but just feel intensely alert to the pain feeling and dread without negativity shine a light in the darkness and inhabit it. Full attention gives the power of the now to create full acceptance. Let your past die and be reborn in the now. Resistance is inseparable from the mind so relinquishing resistance is rejection of the false god in your mind all judgement and negativity dissolve and the space of being opens up with love and joy the inner core of the sacred. This very life is always inside of you and you need to remove things to tap into your innate being. We inflict suffering on ourselves which prevents our enlightenment. Dwell in the now the state of presence. Choice requires full consciousness so if you don’t have this you’re actually not making conscious choices at all just unconscious ones. Don’t let some other self choose something for you just look the pain body in the face and tell it it doesn’t control you reshape you attachment to pain. Nobody chooses pain it happens because of a lack of presence once you grant yourself presence pain starts to reverse. It wakes you up. Unconscious mind leads to mind identified state that takes away choice you must first show compassion then work to create presence and consciousness of the mind. Forgiveness use the power of the now to render the past useless and powerless. When you no longer ask if you need to surrender you have done it.

    - **Note:** Be present in the moment and face pain directly. Accept without labeling. Fully accept the now. Be present in the moment. Surrender to the moment be present. Don’t reject your enlightenment and let the unconscious pain body make decisions. You need to be fully present then choose love not pain. Discover your path.
- Resistance is always unconscious and can only survive in the ego. If you were conscious negativity would die. Negativity can only exist in your absence not presence you can write books about presence but until you start embracing the now and experiencing it you’ve made no progress it makes no difference it’s not a reality. Surrender leads to dissolving of mind and creates freedom. You can say no to unconscious people who use you without anger or bias just a present no when people create negativity in your life you can remove yourself from them or the situation. Inner freedom from external conditions will create and project a better version of yourself that will also have the side effect of improving external conditions. Need to accept what is before you can take any more positive steps. You need to accept people the way they are and accept the now for now not a means to a future end. Observe your attachment to feeling right in an argument this is your ego then you can surrender the entire mental emotional association and you need to be mindful and realize if you have truly let go of your association and accepted it to not reinforce the ego and free yourself to your mind. When you stop identifying conversations open up. This doesn’t mean letting negative things happen but like martial arts turning those negatives to be channeled and used against their own negativity. Resistance is weakness and fear masquerading as strength. When you surrender you drop your ego defenses and false masks to become very real the ego says this us dangerous and can lead to injury but only through letting go of this by being vulnerable can you discover your invulnerability
- Surrender is yielding to the flow of life not resisting it. Things go wrong often and at those moments surrender to what is is most important to reconnect with being. Surrender is inner outwardly you can take steps to improve the situation. You can accept your stuck in the mud without judgement or negativity then take positive action to remove yourself from the situation but always embrace the now as what is without judgement or anger then. Work on how to project forward. Things are what they are don’t make the moment your enemy it doesn’t help you. Surrender is the first step to taking action it connects you to your being. The quality of your consciousness in the moment determines your future. See clearly what needs to be done without bias. Your life history is a fog of past and future your present is a flashlight that clarifies the now and cuts through the fog. You can look at a situation objectively make a plan for the future but you can only take one action at a time don’t worry about the 100 actions down the line. Don’t project yourself too far in the future and let go of the now when you embrace the now negatives dissolve in conscious presence. Be careful you’re fully surrendering and not resisting. Resisting is natural but serves no purpose so observe it and try to get past it.

    - **Note:** Surrender is radical acceptance of the now without bias. Once you accept you can’t make a plan to move forward not all at once but in stages. See the situation objectively and move forward. Live in the now and be present. Don’t wait and postpone life.
- There can be no salvation in externals when you realize this you’re one step from enlightenment. Don’t resist life just accept it. Don’t feel dependent on any externals. Ego believes through negativity it can manipulate reality and get what it wants but this is false. You believe negativity works or you wouldn’t do it but this is false so why do it because it makes the ego feel better but this is overall bad so don’t bother with it. You don’t want positive change because it changes your identity but this is a lie you tell yourself to help the ego surrender to the now be yourself and forget this. Use negativity as a signal to maintain presence and wake up. Always when drifting just tell yourself to draw attention to the hear and now. Practice responding to the minds irritation and transforming it into positives. Practice with the small things first then bigger things let it pass right through you when things try to hurt you. Reclaim your power over your inner state. You can’t look for peace from the outside you must realize it from the inside. When you accept what is every moment is the best. Compassion is the shared connection with other living beings. True relationships come after recognizing your being. Meditate on death. Perception of the world reflects your consciousness. Many different interpretations and worlds exist due to very different consciousness world is the reflection of the ego and this can change. Awake from form transcend the world. You cannot fight unconsciousness it’ll only become ingrained.
- Conditions not positive or negative they are what they are. Allow things to be as it is forgive the present so there are no issues at a later time. You can’t be happy when something bad happens but you can be at peace. Do what you have to do and accept what is and comes to you as your destiny. When you relinquish and forgive you create the higher good but this comes through forgiveness of the past and the presence. The ego creates drama which creates all of your own problems it like power struggles greed ect. We create our own drama by letting the past obscure the present feeling guilty ect. People fear losing the drama in their life. When you’re fully conscious you cannot be in conflict with yourself or others because no one at one can conceive of conflict. Conflict is the difference between the demands of the minds and what is. Allow the isness of all things to release a deep stillness. There are cycles in life and you need to accept the up and down of cycles and embrace the flow of life cycles growth and death are natural in life. Success and failure are intertwined all forms are impermanent these aren’t your life but your life situation some cycles feel very productive while others can feel stagnant. Nothings lasts everything is impermanent connect with internal not external forms because externals change. You can’t find joy through externals don’t aim to form an identity through externals it’s all fleeting except you internal true oneness

    - **Note:** Life is impermeant and life is cyclical with ups and downs and we must accept the internal locus of control not the external one to be happy. We need to accept the world as it is and make peace with that. Be at peace and accept the world you don't have to love it but you must embrace the isness of the world. Control your inner monolog. We give agency to things nothing is inherently positive or negative. Perception vs interpretation gap. We must forgive and let go that leads to the higher good of presence. People want to make themselves miserable by running the same negative ideas over and over again. Dispel negativity with presence. Conflict is the unaligned life. Align your life. Accept your destiny and what the universe has planned for you.
- When your relationship isn’t working be happy the unconscious is being surfaced this must happen before change. Know and see unconscious behavior in relationships to effect real change. Once you know you take steps to heal. Relinquish judgement that’s the only way you can actually drive things forward sometimes you can give advice but if this is biased and ties your identity the problem only gets worse. If you can without this do it but it’s very hard. Watch the reaction in relationships and instead of welcoming the darkness bring in the light that’s how to build long term relationships. Express thoughts instantly and don’t create a time gap to allow discontent to not grow. Listen without blaming. Be present and give space to others. Ego needs problems to create an enhanced sense of separateness. The need for pain drives it to reinforce the ego and not having it can be very bad leading to a painful loss of identity. When we defend ourselves we entrench more and this leads to more disfunction. Avoid the root. Accept and transform pain with presence. Surrender non judgement and openness allows life to be and realize presence instead of resisting it. You can’t heal pain when it’s apart of your identity you need to break attachment between pain and identity. You can control of your inner space in this moment. Feel the pain give attention than acceptance and then transmute that feeling into a true consciousness with a new nature. Don’t mistake the pain body for who someone is draw them back into the here and now. Create a vortex of consciousness don’t have a relationship with yourself but merge you and yourself into one thing lose the relationship with yourself.

    - **Note:** First step to solving a problem is mindful awareness of it then you can take steps to heal without judgement; do not tie to identity only makes it worse. Relinquish judgement to open yourself up to change. This is very hard but this is how change happens. In relationships reject darkness and bring in the light to build long term relationships built on love and truth. Be present with others and allow the love to flourish in the moment. The ego wants to create conflict but you must be present in the world not manifesting a future conflict that the ego wants this leads to loss of identity. We need pain to reinforce the ego but it doesnt help us. Turn pain into presence. Allow life to be dont resist it. The pain body wants to pull you don't but transmute that pain into presence and merge your 2 selfs into one person a direct relationship with yourself.
- True salvation is to be who you are feel that all in the present moment. You find god in the here and now and you can always get there by realizing you’re there already you find god by realizing you don’t need to seek it that you’ve reached it. Until you’re present all relationships are flawed. Negativity and positivity in a relationship are 2 sides of the same coin true happiness in relationship only come from presence. If your love has an opposite it isn’t love but an ego based attachment you can’t find happiness in a relationship before you find it in yourself. Addictions arise from refusal to face your pain whether it be drugs or relationships. You need to be present to avoid pain and solve it internally you can’t run from it it’ll always catch you. Happiness comes from stopping judgement and accepting what is this is the key to happiness. Stop judging or changing people accept them this transcends ego. Love is deep within you and every other creature realizing this and seeing it in others is being with god the eternal one life. Exclusively is ego not love but love can be stronger with people. Even in bad relationships sometimes in intense emotional moments pain body will subside and you’ll feel fully present. True communication is communion this renders the mind powerless and reveals your being. Mind and mind identification don’t make you yourself but a mental image of yourself that you’re projecting and concealing but not really living and being. Crisis breeds opportunity but we can’t live and fall further into crisis we can’t escape our problems we must confront them or we’ll remain trapped. When you know there is disharmony and you can accept or deny it acceptance leads to freedom. Don’t remain trapped. When you know you’re unhappy and you hold that then you realize it cannot remain there it’s just a matter of time. When you know you’re not at peace you surround this feeling with love. Transform into peace. You cannot transform yourself or your partner with inner transformation just create a space for grace and love to enter.

    - **Note:** Salvation is realizing you're enough and being present. Until your present you'll always be flawed. Love should be unconditional and have no opposite don't become addicted to love or have insecure attachment. Don't judge or change just accept others. Accepting life as is is the key to happiness. when we resist life and let the ego run us we become unhappy. Do not judge or change people just transcend. True communication reveals your being. When you identify with your mind and ego you conceal yourself. Crisis breeds opportunity to grow. Life becomes unalligned when you cannoy accept it as it is and you're no longer at peace with yourself. Transform the world to create peace.
- Don’t give up the world of the unmanifestes when you enter the world of forms. Use i bee body as portal to enter unmanifested. Other ways to enter unmanifested living in now, stopping thought, let go of inner mental emotional resistance to what is surrender to what is. These 4 portals are the ways to leave the world of forms into the unmanifested. Inner stillness the essence of things is emptiness in touch with the unmanifested and love the manifest in its life beyond form. Emptiness is the definition of life the world is shaped by its emptiness as much by its stuff experience these areas of emptiness explore these empty spaces as the essence of life. Everything manifests and dissolves. The purpose of the world is to allow you to transcend the world.

    - **Note:** The world really exists in the empty and half spaces between form where everything is decided by chance. When we want to see the universe, we look at these half spaces. This gets us in touch with the universe and the essence of everything. Everything lies in the creation and destruction is empty spaces. The world lies in these spaces. Purpose of living is too quiet everything to experience life.
- Words bs definitions being is something you must feel you can’t be run by the egoic mind. Focus on being take your mind away from thinking focus on the inner energy field of the body. Focus on being on the body to be aware of your deeper self. Feel the energy in your body. We shouldn’t escape our body’s but become one with the body in order to achieve enlightenment be permanently connected to inner body the more consciousness directed to the inner body the higher the frequency of it is which is like a light that grows brighter and negativity cannot effect you anymore. You start transcending yourself at a higher level of being be anchored in the now. Examine attention and listen to your inner body feel it from within listen to your body. Go into the now by going into the body. Don’t be run by your mind. When you have issues don’t let the fear response take over go into and listen to your body. Ground yourself deeply in the foundation of the inner body. Attention is key to transformation you must feel before you forgive. Forgiveness allows life to live through you you must forgive yourself to become present. When you’re meditating focus on the energy at specific areas of the body like feet head ect then feel the energy running through the body like a wave. Then feel the inner body in its totality in the energy of the inner body. Be present with your body. Don’t listen while you think but listen with your body.

    - **Note:** Become more intune with your body become one with it feel the energy flow through. When you become aware of the body you have an innate sense of how you feel. Integrated body and mind. Anchor yourself to physical feelings become one integrated being. Listen and know yourself deeply. Ground yourself in the body. Forgive yourself of the past and let life run through you. Ground yourself in your body
- To get rid of fear or unhappiness take action to change your situation if you can’t accept the situation find the steps that cure your problems and don’t let fear spread to your brain stress is focus on the future at the expense of the now. Don’t be too future oriented live in the now don’t live in fear but embrace problems head on. Don’t be a habitual waiter be in the here and now if you’re always waiting for the next vacation or relationship and never living in the here and now you’ll never be happy don’t be a perpetual waiter. You can’t wait because nothing comes in the future be grateful for the moment. Focus not on the past or future but now deeper your sense of being in the now. Your inner journey only ever has one step now. Become aware of the present to lose the past. You just be present in a state of waiting observance to achieve mindfulness. Total presence is required to find your essence. Create a gap between perception and thought don’t look at a flower and think it’s beautiful but feel its beauty. Consciousness is being is takes in forms but has no forms itself. Free consciousness from form.

    - **Note:** Get action to change the bed situation. A lot of issues come when we focus on the future at the expense of the now. Don’t be a habitual waiter focusing on the next vacation or situation. Focus on now. Consciousness is formless, and only happens when you embrace the now. Don’t wait for life get action now.
- Most people just alternate between states of unconsciousness. We become addicted to things to take us out of the present moment like tv and become addicted to these things. Deep unconsciousness is heightened resistance to what is. Challenges can awaken you or make you more unconscious. You need to be trained to be fully conscious in pain that is how you achieve true presence not just when you’re peaceful be attune to what happens inside of you. Recognize and feel the energy and emotion you are feeling. Don’t make an enemy of resist the present moment. That creates very negative thought patterns. Negativity feeds negativity so understand what about the situation you are viewing negatively is it the person or the job and then figure out how to express that feeling and change that or accept it but remaining negative only creates a compounding negative cycle which is not helpful change or accept but you cannot just accept negativity you’re responsible for your inner space ie your mind and keeping it clean don’t pollute it. Recognize you don’t want an emotion then drop that emotion. Complaining is non acceptable if what is it makes you into a victim either speak out or take a think in the situation instead of complaining. Be in the here now totally or take action.

    - **Note:** People live unconscious lives, alternating between states of not being in the moment and challenges can wake us up to pain or make us further shy away. Pain can make us wanna be more unconscious, but we need to be mindful and conscious, especially in this moment. Watch your mind investigate your emotions and if an emotion does not serve, you don’t allow it to be in your headspace. Complaining is not acceptable. Don’t be a victim.
- Don’t identify with the mind just observe it. In high emotion scenarios we become our emotions they take us over but we can fight back watch the mind then take the steps to take it back. When you identify you give the mind more energy to feed negative thoughts. You can use time as a practical benefit but don’t let it take over your life the present is the essential factor. Clock vs psychological time one is learning from a failure vs associating that failure with your sense of self. Anti creating a present hell to justify a future end. Are you always living for a future end trying to get somewhere always everything is a means to short term pleasures focused on becoming or achieving looking for external people to give meaning to your life danger of psychological time. When you’re always wanting something you lose the now. Don’t want the future as an escape for the present. Sadness is caused by a lack of presence. Presence is the key to getting rid of the problem. Don’t resist the past or what is just accept your life as is. Your life situation exists in time but you live in the now when you make it about your life situation and not presence you’re not living. Listen to energy and sounds of the moment. There are no problems just situations to be dealt with now or accepted as part of life or the present moment. Don’t make a situation into a problem focus on what you can do when you create problems you create pain choose no more problems no more pain. In an emergency we don’t create problems we just get present. Our identity creates problems for us. Don’t worry about the what but the how of doing. Just focus on your action not the result of your action. Find the life under life situation focus on being. Don’t pursue goals with grim determination but with a whimsical joy. You don’t associate your identity with things so nothing about you gets threatened. Freedom from outcome the external world is impermanent

    - **Note:** Non identification with the mind is powerful. When you identify with the mind you grand the mind and ego power over you but when you ignore it don’t feed it and get present that’s the key. Don’t feed negative thoughts.
      Living in the future always wanting something living in a constant state of desire. Don’t want the future as an escape from the now.
      Your life situation exists in time don’t resist but accept it and then live in the now. There are no problems just situations to be dealt with and accepted as part of life. Don't make it about your life situation make it about the present. Don't make a situation into a problem. Focus on what you have agency over without creating pain. Don't create problems or worry in your life. Looks at life with joy and free yourself from your identity.
      Sit and observe your feelings as a neutral 3rd party
      Clock vs psychological time.
- Another issue with the ego is sometimes we dont feel whole and we look to fill that feeling but nothing you fill it with can satisfy it is bottomless. They do it to feel better about themselves. As long as the ego runs your mind you can never be at peace your ego must be fed constantly. These externals are not you the secret is to kill this ego because you die before you really die. None of your external attachments are you identity. Your ego attached yourself to your problems which leads to issues when you’re present you allow your mind to be lost in yourself don’t seek things in your mind. Dis identify with time and your mind. All you have is the present the now. All you have is the now. Shift from time to being mind to presence. Walk on the razors edge no problem no suffering just your essence lives in you suffering needs time. Ask yourself what in the moment is lacking or if not now when. When you see things that the present falls away the world is just a little bit better and more magical. Step out of time into the now don’t think about the future or past. Be present as the watcher of your mind. Be present in the moment and interested in your reactions. Don’t judge or analyze watch the thought feel the emotion observe the reaction don’t make a personal problem out of these things.

    - **Note:** Your ego fills your emptiness with externals but this is the path to misery no externals can make you feel whole. Disidentify with time the mind and the ego. Be present in the now. When you are present you can see the magic of every moment. Ignore the future and past. Watch your mind and observe your thoughts then let them go. Do not let the mind run you with thoughts that dont serve you. Become aware of your inner monologues and cultive the thoughts that serve us.
- 2 types of consciousness pain from the past and pain we’re manifesting from loss of presence in the moment. Don’t worry about time but live in the present moment. Accept present moment then act. Work with the present moment make it your friend. We accumulate pain that creates a negative energy field in our body. This pain body can be dormant or active. The pain body is a thought pattern that can take you over and you must be mindful to avoid this. The pain body perpetuates pain inside of you to grow it and feed itself be aware of these patterns to kill them. You need to be conscious of the pain body then break association with it to kill it. Watch it and cast a light on it light kills it don’t align thinking with it stay present to watch it feel it’s energy once you feel its energy it takes over don’t let it. Become aware of the pain body but don’t think about it just watch it and be aware without thought being created. Focus attention on feeling fine judge or analyze history be aware of it. Don’t create an identity stay present continue to be the observer of what is happening. Be aware of the pain and the silent watcher. Be the watcher of what happens inside you then transform it. You’ll face possibly intense resistance in disassociating. Some people are so attached that disassociating is really hard just observe and be present in these feelings without bias. Your ego is always afraid of death ego sees itself as constantly under threat sends fear to the body. The need to feel right for self preservation leads to a lot of suffering so lose that. We play power games to be right which leads to suffering don’t defend some fake identity but be conscious and lose this identity that creates power games. When you’re conscious of this this power mindset dissolves power over others is weakness disguised as strength true power is within and always available

    - **Note:** Power over others is weakness disguised as strength. Ignore the pain body and impress the present moment. The Payne body is the stories we tell ourselves about past experiences that we need to rewrite in order to step forward into our new life. We need to become first aware of it and then disassociate from it, which is very painful because so much of our identity and ego is tied up in it, but it doesn’t serve us so we need to move on.
- Sit above your mind and laugh at your thoughts 90% if thoughts are repetitive don’t become addicted to thinking. The ego thinks past and future tied to identity mitigate that live in the now. Enlightenment means rising above thought and you think for practical purposes but lose the negative internal dialogue you ossolate between thinking mind and still mind consciousness without thought. Connect mind with larger part of consciousness mind gives form to creative impulse of the no mind. Observe emotions as the physical manifestation of thought in the body disassociate from both. Learn what reaction in the body gives what emotion if you think one emotion and feel another the body is usually right not the mind. Thinks love joy and peace lie past emotion in a higher state. All emotions are reactions to a threat to your ego. You need to seperate your mind of cravings just be present in observance of the mind.

    - **Note:** Most of our thoughts are us repeating these old thought patterns that make us feel comfortable but don't help or serve us. They take us away from our presence in the now. They are tied to our ego and we must transcend these patterns to attain enlightenment. Tap into a higher consciousness. Listing to the body because that is the physical manifestation of your true thoughts. Once you have understood these at a deep level you take steps to transcend. Be present observe your ego and mind. Don't steal the present from yourself
      Sit above your mind feel emotions be present don’t give into repetitive negative thoughts
- Being can be felt when you’re living in the now but never understood. You need to find enlightenment inside yourself it can’t be taught to you it’s inside you always. Awareness of being is enlightenment. The constant need to think and have your mind move prevents us from simply being. Mental noise prevents inner stillness that is being. Thinking is not being and identity shouldn’t be associated with thinking non identification with things we live in state of separateness a complex world which fragments us but enlightenment is a state of wholeness being as one with both the world and yourself. Liberate yourself from thinking non identification with thoughts this creates separateness. You let your mind use you when you think aimlessly. You need to have the ability turn off your mind and monitor the thinking that goes on in it. When you’re seeing the thinker you unlock a higher level of consciousness control the voice in your head ie self talk. Our thoughts are the sum product of our experiences and societal bias be aware of the mental dialogue and through awareness you understand and start to disassociate. When you recognize this the thoughts subside and you experience nothing but inner peace. This could last a moment or a long time. This makes you more present and happier/ alert. Highly alert and aware but not thinking is essence of meditation. Be totally present in every activity leads to inner peace disassociate with you mind.

    - **Note:** Enlightenment and happiness exists inside ourselves there is no one coming to give it to us. What prevents enlightenment is the ego getting in the way. The mental noise that prevent the inner stillness. We need to disidentify with our thinking mind. The thinking mind fragments us into 2 different beings the thinking mind and our true present self. When we are unaware of the situation we let our thinking mind take control which leads to a wandering mind aimlessly moving through the world. This is your mind using you. This comes through in our self talk, but we can clearly see there is a level above the talk that we can transcend to become truly us. You become fully aware but not thinking just total present.
