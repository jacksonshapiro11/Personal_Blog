### Highlights

- Longevity Defined: More than Just Lifespan
  Summary:
  Longevity encompasses both lifespan and healthspan, and requires a nuanced understanding of each.
  Lifespan, the first vector, is a clear binary measure of life or death, while healthspan is a subjective and multifaceted concept, encompassing physical, cognitive, and emotional health. Each component of healthspan can decline with age, showcasing a more complex reality compared to the straightforward measure of lifespan.
  Although both physical and cognitive health often decline over time, emotional health may improve with age, highlighting the potential for personal growth in this aspect.
  Thus, longevity involves not just living longer but also slowing the rate of decline in healthspan, ensuring that individuals can enjoy better quality of life even as they age, rather than simply extending lifespan without addressing health quality.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  I think it'd be nice just to be like for this conversation to anchor what we're talking about, how do you define longevity?
  Speaker 1
  I don't make an argument that my definition is the best definition, but I agree with the idea that whenever someone is talking about it, it's worth asking them what they mean by it. And it's also why I tend to bristle at the association with longevity, because, you know, if someone says, oh, are you a longevity doctor or something like that, I have no idea if they Know what longevity means according to my definition, which again is not to say it's the right definition, but it's the lens through which I think about it. Therefore, everything I talk about, any question I answer will be through the lens. The way I think about it and I suspect the way some others do as well is that longevity is, well, it's a function. So again, I tend to think of things mathematically made up of two vectors. And one of these vectors is lifespan. And one of these vectors is health span. And both of these vectors are necessary to demonstrate the function of longevity. Now, one of these vectors is much easier to understand because it is discrete, it is binary, and it is objective, and that is the lifespan vector. So there are some edge cases, but for the most part, you are alive or you are dead. And we think of that through the lens of death certificate death. Again, we could talk about an edge case, you can have an individual who is brain dead, but who is being kept alive, and we could debate whether that person is dead or alive. But I think for most people, there's very little confusion about what it means to be alive or dead. And notice that lifespan says nothing about the quality of a person's life. We'll save that for a second. But in a nutshell, that is lifespan. It is to be respiring or not to be respiring. And it is, again, one of the vectors of longevity. So in as much as we want to increase longevity, we presumably want to have something to do with increasing lifespan. The second vector that makes up this longevity function is the healthspan vector. This is far more complicated to explain. It is far more subjective. It is analog as opposed to digital, meaning it is not discrete on off. It is And it also has three components in the way that I think about it. So one of those is a physical component, one of them is a cognitive component, and one of those is an emotional component. Now, in the first version of Outlive, when I wrote it, or maybe it was the second version, but not the version that got published, I went to great lengths to describe that the cardio-respiratory Death, the I'm not aspiring death certificate death as type one death. And then I went into great machinations to talk about the three types of decline in health span as physical, cognitive, and emotional death. And I think for probably good reason, everybody, the publisher and Bill, everybody really pushed back on that and they thought it was a little too morbid to talk about physical death As the death of your exoskeleton and cognitive decline. And I think they were right. I think that death was probably too strong a word there. But my point was that all of those things can be robbed of a person. And even though they're still technically alive, their quality of life has been sapped. So let's not think of it that way. Let's think of it as you have these three sub-vectors of the vector health span, and each of those, there are ways that we can try to quantify them. But ultimately, I think people will have their own subjective assessment of what it means to be physically healthy, or what it means to be cognitively healthy, or what it means to be Emotionally healthy. I think another thing that's worth pointing out here is that of those three inevitably decline with age. So the physical component of health span, which I'll define in some detail in a moment, and the cognitive component of health span, they very predictably decline with age. Now that doesn't mean that everybody's declined at the same rate. And that doesn't mean that for everybody the decline reaches a level that is quote unquote, pathological, but it simply means, and I was thinking about this today in the gym actually, I was like, wow, it is really so obvious to me with each passing day that I am completely past my prime, physically and cognitively. And I will never again be as physically strong, fit, flexible, free of pay, like pick your metrics that all make up physical health span. I will never again reach the pinnacles that I had reached in my late teens and 20s. And similarly, cognitively, I'm basically a moron compared to the person I used to be in terms of processing, speed, problem solving, just raw intellectual horsepower. Those things are going to decline even further. Now, there is more nuance to this because there are certain things physically today that I think I actually do better than I did before. In other words, you take advantage of the fact that as you're getting less explosive, less powerful, well, you can still kind of maintain strength. And if you learn to move more intelligently, you can actually become more effective. And similarly, as our intelligence transitions from a more fluid form when we're young to a more crystallized experiential form when we're older, we still have remarkable ability To contribute. But there's no denying that on some of the prime levers against which you would evaluate these, we're in a state of decline. Conversely, the third part of health span, which is emotional health, it actually doesn't really tie to age much at all. Depending on how you evaluate it, it almost seems to have a U-shaped curve, not a really big obvious U, but kind of a dip in, I think statistically, probably the late 40s, and then a gradual Rising again. So one of the things that I always try to remind myself and then remind my patients is this is something we can really look forward to, provided we do the work. I can be emotionally better off in a decade than I am today, and I am certainly better off today than I was a decade ago. So I would say that that is at the highest level how I describe longevity, and therefore, when a patient comes to me and says, I'm interested in longevity, I want to make sure that what They're interested in is what I understand because there are many other definitions of longevity out there. If your definition of longevity is, I want to live to be 200, I wouldn't obviously be able to help you. The way I think about it is longevity means how ([Time 0:04:40](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5896f41d-8e55-4727-a352-377c91b643cc))

- Prioritize Fundamentals: Calories, Protein, and Micronutrients
  Summary:
  Focus on five core areas for optimizing health: nutrition, exercise, sleep, pharmacology, and emotional health.
  Each bucket plays a crucial role in overall wellbeing. While pollution and accident avoidance could be considered additional factors, the primary emphasis should remain on the first five.
  Understanding the framework of the centenary decathlon can provide clarity and a structured approach to how to effectively engage with exercise, distinguishing it from other perspectives on physical activity.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  But the big five buckets are nutrition, exercise, sleep, pharmacology, and emotional health. Again, we could talk about a sixth bucket, which would be pollution, radical temperature exposure, accident avoidance, so behaviors to avoid harmful accidents, automotive accidents, Things like that. So there's definitely also like a grab bag sixth column that you could include if you wanted to. But I mostly talk about the first five.
  Speaker 2
  We'll start with your favorite, which is not ironic in that statement. It is actually your favorite, which is exercise. I think what would be helpful is you've talked about this before, but this framework of the centenary decathlon. Do you want to just quickly state what that is? Because I think it kind of gives some grounding and foundation to how you think about exercise compared to how others may talk about it. ([Time 0:47:55](https://share.snipd.com/snip/bd1f7e2d-230d-46df-88c7-fd4494384ef2))
    - **Note:** Important inputs into health. Nutrition unclear but big inputs are energy balance through right caloric intake and protein with fats and carbs making up the rest of your energy needs.
- Train Today for a Vibrant Tomorrow
  Summary:
  A focus on long-term health and functional capacity in later life is essential, as many individuals often lose the ability to engage in meaningful activities before their physical demise.
  The centenarian decathlon serves as a mental model for defining key activities one wants to perform at an advanced age and identifying the physical traits necessary to achieve them. It emphasizes the importance of stability as the foundation of fitness, highlighting the re-trainability of stability deficits even in older age.
  Strength and power are also critical, building upon stability to maintain a good quality of life.
  Furthermore, cardiorespiratory fitness is conceptualized as a triangle, encompassing aerobic efficiency and VO2 max, which reflects overall endurance and functional capacity.
  Training should focus on maintaining these capabilities to ensure that individuals can thrive well into their later years, ultimately allowing them to function comparably to younger, healthier versions of themselves.

  Speaker 1
  Well, I used to do this, I guess I should still do this. But it was this totally rudderless existence that I had. And it stayed that way until the summer of 2018 when I was at the funeral of the parent of one of my best friends. And apologies for repeating this because I do write about this in the book, but basically, at that funeral, I realized that while my friend's mom had died a relatively old age, I think About 89, her physical life had basically demised so significantly in the past decade that her actual death was almost just a matter of formality. But she had lost the ability to do the things that mattered to her most a decade earlier. So she couldn't play golf anymore because of her shoulder. She couldn't garden because of her knees and hips and back. She couldn't even play with her grandkids. And so she spent most of the last decade of her life, largely uninvolved in anything. And did come down with dementia in the final year of her life and that's what ultimately took her life. But I was just totally blown away by this person that I once remembered as being completely vibrant, losing everything and spending this last year in this state. And I realized in that moment, as I literally sat in a church pew, first of all, this is really common. And secondly, this is what I want to train for. For the first time in four years realized, aha, the thing I want to train for is to avoid this. I want to come up with an event, an athletic event that will be done at the end of my life and everything between now and then will be training for it. And so I just came up with this idea called the centenarian decathlon, not because it implies that one has to live to a hundred to compete or not even to imply that it has to have ten events. But simply as a mental model to say what are the most important activities, both activities of daily living and activities of performance that I want to be able to do at the end of my life And how well can I define them, how well can I understand the physical traits that will be necessary to execute them, and then how much can I reverse from there or backcast from there, What I need to be doing today to increase the probability of doing those things tomorrow to the highest level. And that has become obviously a huge obsession of mine. As you know, I along with a couple of other folks have started a company around this called 10 squared, which is just geared towards training people to do this. And I think that it is at least until someone shows me a better idea, the best model for how to train if your goal is not something very specific. So again, if you came to me and said, I know how much you love Jiu-Jitsu, if you're like, look, there's this tournament coming up in six months and I really want to compete for it, that's Not the centenary into Kathalyn. That's a very specific type of training you need to be doing in Jiu-Jitsu to go and compete there. My wife is running the Boston Marathon next year and she wants to run a certain time. She will have nothing to do with training her centenary into Cathlon. She is going to be doing very, very specific running workouts to make sure she hits her goals. So there are lots of other ways to train, but my point is that most people aren't training to be the best at their local jiu-jitsu tournament or to run their PR at the Boston Marathon. And even if they do those things, they're usually fleeting. And ultimately, what people really want to be training for is to be the most kick-ass versions of themselves in the last decade of their life. And again, if that means you're 80 to 90 years are functioning like you're a really good 70 year old, that's a totally different experience from what most people go through.
  Speaker 2
  Say someone is training for the Centenary Decathlon, so they kind of agree and they say, I want to put all my focus into this, which is how do I become an athlete focused on life? And we don't have to get into these in detail because in the show notes, we'll link to the multiple, multiple places we've talked about them. But what are the four components that you think are important for someone who is interested in training for the centenary decathlon?
  Speaker 1
  You start on the foundation. You have to have stability. You have to have the chassis. Basically, I'd say the chassis and the tires. You have to have every aspect of the motor control, coordination, ability to dissipate force, ability to receive force, ability to balance. There's so much that goes into stability that it I think got a full half chapter in the book. And it's far and away the most complicated to explain, but it's really obvious to see it when it's not there. So every one of us is lacking in stability and it was the biggest reeducation for me as I pivoted to this way of training. So it's everything from learning how to appropriately pressurize your intra-abdominal space to how to unlock your ribs, maintain an appropriate center of gravity, how to be able To isometrically contract muscles as necessary, how to be able to do it under control, how to have good foot mechanics, right? I mean, all of these things we've done dedicated podcasts on because each component of this stability game is quite nuanced. And the good news is while most of us show up to the middle part of our life with enormous deficits here, they're all retrainable. We're actually still quite plastic in our old age. Second component is strength. And I would say a subcomponent of strength is power. So even though we lose power very quickly as we age, the more we can maintain it, the better. And you can't have power without strength and stability. The third component, and this is really more of a continuum. The third and fourth are part of a continuum of cardiorespiratory fitness. I talk about this as being a triangle. So the base of the triangle is the aerobic efficiency. So this is the maximum fat oxidation. This is your all day pace. We want that to be as high as possible. And then the peak of the triangle is the VO2 max. That's most adequately thought of as the engine size. So that's the peak aerobic output. Those are the four components. And one of the exercises we do with both our patients, and obviously the clients in 10 Square, is once you have a person's centenarian decathlon goals, ([Time 0:51:38](https://share.snipd.com/snip/128773d1-2e08-4958-bd89-3eb9f747e488))

- Balance Energy and Protein for Optimal Health
  Summary:
  Energy balance is the most critical factor influencing overall health, where total calorie intake is paramount, although diet quality and protein intake also play significant roles.
  Consuming adequate protein is essential, with a recommended average of 1.6 grams per kilogram of body weight, as protein needs increase with age due to anabolic resistance. Most individuals today are overnourished, with nearly 70% being overweight or obese, leading to the necessity of caloric reduction.
  Effective strategies for reducing caloric intake include directly lowering caloric consumption, implementing dietary restrictions, and employing time-restricted eating to induce a caloric deficit.
  While nuanced diets can vary, these foundational principles of nutrition—energy balance and adequate protein—are crucial for health management.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  There aren't a lot of things can be stated at a high enough degree of certainty that you should act on them with almost blind faith. So here are the two that I can tell you with a very, very high degree of certainty. The first is that the single most important input from nutrition to a person's overall health is energy balance. Stated another way, the energy input of food is the first order determinant of health. Maybe stated another way, the total calories you consume would be the most important thing. Not the only thing. I do not want to suggest that a thousand calories of tic-tacs is the same as a thousand calories of broccoli. It is not. But I'm also talking about this through the lens of common sense. And the truth of it is, you subside on a diet of tic tacs, you're going to eat a lot more than a thousand calories of them because they're not satiating and they're junk and they're hollow. So I want to be very clear that the primary input is total energy, but it is also impacted by many other things, including diet quality, processing, and macronutrient distribution. The second thing that is abundantly clear is that protein is the macronutrient we should be least flexible on. Another way, we can be quite flexible on how much carbohydrate and fat we consume to fill our energy needs. But because protein is not consumed for the purpose of ATP generation, which is the principal reason we consume carbohydrates and fats, although fats are also essential for some structural Purposes, we cannot be too flexible or compromising in our protein requirements. In other words, if you really wanted to just come up with a single number to give people, I would say on average about 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight should be consumed By everybody. Now again, I hate saying that because there's truly nothing that you can say across the board. There are clearly people who based on what they're eating will need more protein and there are probably people who can get away with a little bit less. If you took a perfectly high quality PD-Cas 1.0 protein in a person who's not over the moon active, they could probably get away with 1.2 grams or even 1 gram, but boy anything below that And you're starting to really miss out. And by the way, as you age, those requirements go up due to anabolic resistance. So again, we can talk all day about every diet under the sun and every religion and every faction of every religion around every dietary tribe. But the truth of it is, it's really hard to find a scientist, an actual nutrition scientist. I'm not talking about an influencer. I'm not talking about a health block. I'm talking about actual people who work in labs doing nutrition who will disagree with that statement. There are some, but they are in the huge minority and interestingly they tend to avoid using human data when they talk about those things. But when you limit yourself to the species of interest, which is humans, not rodents, and you talk about experimental data coupled with other insights, those two things seem to matter The most. How many calories are you getting? Not too much, not too little. Are you getting enough protein? Obviously, there are other terms. We certainly want to make sure you're getting enough micronutrients as well and that you're avoiding toxins. That tends to be less of an issue today than it was a hundred years ago. But of course that's also really interesting. But a lot of the other stuff, Nick, is details. So when I'm looking at a patient, given how important those things are, to me it makes sense to be evaluating those things at the outset. So when we do a DEXA scan on somebody on day one, and we can see how much subcutaneous fat they have, how much visceral fat they have, how much muscle mass they have, and we can do a lot of advanced Blood work and see how metabolically healthy they are, how well they dispose of glucose, all these other things, I can very quickly answer three questions. Literally, on first contact, are you over nourished or under nourished? And that really comes down to energy balance. How much fat do you have on your body and how well is it distributed throughout your body? Where is it distributed? Second question, are you adequately muscled or are you undermuscled? Third question, are you metabolically healthy or not? And when you can answer those three questions, which you can in a very short period of time with a relatively small amount of data, that tells you, does this person need to eat more, less, Or the same total energy, the same amount of protein or and how important and what type of exercise should they be doing to augment our findings. Because we're talking about nutrition, I'll close this out by saying most people when they do this come out slightly in the overnourished category. That's just another way of saying most people are overweight or obese. Think the numbers are probably 70% of the population are overnourished or significantly overnourished. Therefore, most people when you go through that whole treatment algorithm are going to be in the I need to eat less camp. If you are in the I need to eat less camp, you now have three ways to do that, three strategies if you will. The first is directly reducing caloric intake. So that says agnostic to what or when I eat, I will simply eat less. This is the most direct way to do it. It has lots of pluses and minuses, which we have discussed in so much detail in other podcasts that we'll link to. The second method is I will identify something or some set of things in the diet that I will remove from the diet. I will restrict them. This is called dietary restriction. And the more restrictive the elements of your diet, the more effective this technique is. So if you only choose to restrict lettuce, this will have no effect. If you restrict everything but potatoes, meaning if the only thing you allow yourself to eat is potatoes, this will have an enormous ([Time 1:01:21](https://share.snipd.com/snip/682efb68-f4d4-41a6-af06-4b0ad6de386c))
    - **Note:** Nutrition and sleep are vital.
