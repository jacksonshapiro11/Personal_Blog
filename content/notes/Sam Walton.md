- Sam invented nothing but copied best practices from everyone. He shipped his competitors his father in law changed his life. He started Walmart in his late life and blew past Sears in his lifetime. Went to school on everyone.
  Bias for action and importance of being frugal. He wasn’t about making money he was just competitive and wanted to win. He got his hair cut at a barber shop and drove a pick up. He set very high goals and never thought he would lose. Determination beats intelligence every day of the week Paul graham.
  Sam wrote this for his grand children so they wouldn’t sell the stock and would view a 100 year time horizon
  Sam spent 50 years in retail and was always reading and visiting stores. He visited more retail stores than anyone in history and shooed his competitors. Bought a Ben Franklin variety store and wanted to make it the best in Arkansas in 5 years. Bhag

    - **Note:** He shopped his competition and had help from others. He had a deep understanding of his craft more than anyone else. Bias for action incredibly frugal with deep self belief and commitment. Grit beats hard work.
- Sam learns the right way then usually runs the other way but you need to learn the right way first. Sam decided to go to 3rd party suppliers instead of Ben Franklin approved ones and runs the most profitable store in the whole chain system. He however didn’t sign a lease and his landlord who owned another store in town kicked him out. Learned a great lesson in ownership and it destroyed everything he built. Sam realized he could buy things cheap and sell at a discount to others but his volume gain due to the discount would more than make up for his haircut. His wife didn’t want to live in a town of over 10k people which is why Walmart focused on small towns.
  Sam woke up every day determined and was very willing to admit he was wrong and move on and improve.
  He drove from Arkansas right Minnesota because he heard someone figured out a better store layout up there. Ruthlessly shopping competition.

    - **Note:** He was first principles thinking and understanding the system before he would work to transcend it. He discovered one idea discounting and worked in small towns his entire life to make his dream a reality. He was willing to admit when he was wrong and improve. He learned hard lessons young about the value of ownership. His failure was the key to his success it opened his mind to thinking bigger and creating walmart
- After he lost his first store he just got right back after it getting a new failing store and improving it ruthlessly. He had starting building an empire when his most successful store was lost to a tornado he just got back after it and rebuilt it. When he was building his empire he thought driving was too slow so he flew a plane around trying to find the best locations. This was his investment in technology Walmart was a very tech focused business. He studies traffic patterns and would fly over competitor stores to count cars in the parking lot

    - **Note:** Sam Walton embraced technology and looked for unique problem solving methods to improve. He had immense self belief and would get up after getting knocked down. There were so many things that went wrong but you're defined by your response to failure
- He operated the most successful independent variety chain in the US he visited sol price in California and realized that discounting was the future and he could either be the target be the disruptor he chose the latter.
  Despite his success he still had to put in 95% of the capitol for his first Walmart he would also roll profits by investing in another store he became very successful this way but had so much personal debt that he needs to ipo.
  Frugal to the core he chose Walmart because fewer letters cost less to buy and light up with neon.
  He was conservative in all aspects of life but in business he was an innovator and marverick. His new store concept was rough around the edges but Sam was a default optimist and knew it would succeed.
  The value of constraints the best opportunities at Walmart came from the necessity to swim upstream. They were under capitalized in small communities forced them to learn many lessons others didn’t mainly that there was much more business in small town America than many dreamed of.

    - **Note:** He shopped his competition and lived in the future didn’t want to be disrupted wanted to disrupt.
      He was relentlessly cost focused.
      Always investing in himself and doubling down. Taking on leverage risky and balls to the wall he was willing to risk everything
      He was conservative in life but a maverick in business active optimism
      Starting small then scaling was vital to live and work within constraints because it breeds innovation
- The winner goes to extremes on maximizing or minimizing a few variables. Sam was so cost focused and did the numbers for every store. Did all the books and signed all the checks. It was just him and the managers no middle. It was extreme decentralization and allowed the store managers room to innovate.
  Successful people listen. Spent every day thinking about retail. He gave away the business to his kids before it was valuable they were constantly in the business. Open minded and against the grain.
  He wanted to have a happy home but his parents always fought and he hated it. Allowed his kids to make their own path but never stay idol.
  Didn’t believe in limits shot for the moon. People thought he was a master operator when in reality he thrived on change and disorder. Was not a grand strategist no decision was sacred.

    - **Note:** Do things to extremes very cost focused. Deep understanding and decentralized management. Wanted to raise his kids to be anything but had to be something. Successful people listen. Deep focus on his business. Limits dont exist just figured it out. Deep understanding of business
- Flying below the radar until you’re too far ahead to catch. The goal should be to build a real business for the long term. Sol price all over this book. Stolen a ton of ideas from sol. In it for the long term not short term. 76 out of the top 100 discounters went out of business they got fat and happy lost focus and lived the high life. Sam never took his eye off the ball by endurance we conquer. He saw he did it one way it wasn’t the best way many ways to skin a cat but it worked for him. Its all about practice you just need to define practice in your field for Sam that was visiting stores and hqs. When he meets you he looks at you and extracts every bit of knowledge in your brain. Learning machine. Sam figured the best of what others figured out.
  Serious financial operators in it fir the long haul with growth on our minds disciplined. Whenever you’re in a room you should have the longest view in the room.
  Figured out Walmart worked and kept building out.
  Sam flew a plane to pick out spots. Would get to the office at 2 am on Saturday. Sam needs uninterrupted time.

    - **Note:** Bad boys move in silence. Shop your competition. Stay focused or go out of business. Such a greater learner learning machines. Long term mindset. Constantly doing the work.
- He’s totally independent thinker and never kept a calendar just focused on the few most important things. Limits are bull shut. Hire people that cover your weaknesses play to your strengths.
  Only hire when it hurts. His competitors were failing and talked about how great they were he was the best and constantly improving. His competition didn’t full send the discount concept so sam despite being inferior won.
  Sam played tennis and hunted and would often turn off and relax. You need to ruthlessly control costs. Simple idea taken seriously.
  Think small and grow big. Investing in technology
  Leveraging the truck drivers. Sam would go to the truck drivers break room at 4 am with donuts sit there for hours grilling them. They gave an unbiased opinion and didn’t care who they talked to they also visited more stores than anyone and had perspective.
  Sam hated bureaucracy and realized it always grew in organizations so it needed to be hacked away.
  His 10 roles didn’t include working hard because if you don’t work hard nothing else matters.

    - **Note:** Independent thinking limits are bullshit. You need to work hard and take breaks. Hire people who compliment you. Hire only when it hurts constraints breed innovation. Hated bureaucracy and controlled costs saw from the front. Invest in tech start smsll then scale.
