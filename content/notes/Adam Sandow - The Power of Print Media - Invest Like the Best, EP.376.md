- Quality over Quantity in Magazine Circulation
  Summary:
  The traditional magazine circulation model focused on mass subscriptions attracted by cheap deals to boast high numbers to advertisers.
  However, this led to a flawed strategy of targeting bulk readers rather than quality readers. A shift was made towards attracting the best readers by distributing high-quality magazines at premium prices in strategic locations like newsstands with the aim of engaging a more affluent and engaged audience.
  This approach led to the creation of MediaJet, a company that strategically placed magazine racks in private airports to target a higher-end demographic.
  By prioritizing quality over quantity, the company was able to attract and retain valuable readers, despite the initial resistance and financial investment required.
  The focus on delivering quality content to the best audience rather than mass circulation has been the foundational strategy that allowed the company to succeed in a competitive market.

  Speaker 1
  So I'll get a little specific to magazines for a minute. It'll help you I think understand or at least it'll give you light into how I thought. So back in 2000, even to this day, if you think about magazine subscriptions, think of any generic magazine that you might subscribe or maybe you used to subscribe to, you'd see 12 issues For $12. And by the way, you get a tote bag. Why was it so cheap? Why was publishers clearing house a thing? Why could you redeem frequent flyer models back in the day? An incredible company by global synapse? Why could you do that? Because publishers got hooked on a drug called circulation. So what does that mean? It means that a magazine says we have 500,000 people that love us so much, they'll pay to get a subscription. We have six hundred eight a million people that are paying. So there was an arms race created by getting mass eyeballs to subscribe. Well, the secret of magazine business again, it's old news if you know the industry was in many cases publishers use third parties that will keep all the money and they give the publisher A penny. The publisher goes, thank you for the penny. It's paid. We've got paid readers. And when you look at the demographics of these magazines, you go, you have a million readers reading a high end home magazine with an average household income of $80,000. That doesn't make sense. Well, they're in an arms race to get a million readers. And what I saw in the magazine business was, my God, that's a pretty flawed strategy. What I want are the best readers. In 2005, I want you to get the best readers, the new stand paying full rate for a magazine. So we went and we launched, there's a lot of my magazines, but when I launched new beauty, I said, I don't want all the readers and I don't want bulk eyeballs. It's a very expensive losing proposition in my opinion. What I want is I want a woman that walks into a new stand that says I'm going to buy that really thick gorgeous beauty magazine that's $10. And we literally Patrick, it was what's the value of a $10 magazine buyer, almost the cost of a year subscription. And what I did is I spent all of our money buying up every slot on every new stand that I could. We would spend more money with Barnes and Noble than any other publisher, because I said, this is real estate for me. I'll never make money selling magazines. In fact, I'll lose money. But that's where I'm going to get the best readers. What happens? The magazine gets the best readers smaller. We've never were the biggest, but someone who buys $10 magazine will now engage in a different way. So the circulation strategy was very different. And what I said was, if I put the quality into the paper, the design, the content, if I put it into making sure it's in the best train stations, the best airports everywhere, I will get the Best readers. And we did. And to this day that strategy has never changed with almost everything we do. I want the best readers. I don't want the most readers. I own a company called MediaJet. It's 16, maybe 17 years old. About 17 years ago, I bought up all the rights in private airports to put new stands. Originally, it was just for my magazines. Why? Because rest assured, anyone flying on a regular basis privately, and you know this, is just a different demographic. I don't even need to charge them for my magazines. It's funny, we were buying a really big magazine in 2010. And I was talking to the president of the company we were buying it from. And I told him about MediaJet. I go, candidly, it's my secret weapon, because you can't imagine how many magazines. I never forgot this. He said, Adam, that's stupid. I said, what do you mean it's stupid? He said, that's public place distribution on your audit. Agencies discount that to zero. You're wasting money. And I said, that is why I'm buying your magazine at 10 cents on the dollar, because I don't care about the audit. I want 25,000 copies a month going into the people getting onto an airplane, burning 10,000 an hour to fly. And that was the whole thing. So we were this contrarian from day one. So it looked like a magazine. But all of a sudden, we've got a recurring revenue business here. We've got a data business there. We're circulating our magazines, getting in the hands of the best people. So I was this outsider that came from the outside of the business. And I just said, we're going to do nothing the way that magazines do. And a lot of times when these big magazines close, it's because they've trained the advertisers to buy eyeballs by the pound, not the quality. And look, I think you'll see now, there are some magazines that have been very successful. Monocles are great example. Todd Ralay's, I think a genius at this stuff, he makes an expensive, beautiful, cerebral magazine that goes to a really good sized audience, but it's highly engaged, highly educated. That's the right demographic. But when you've got a generic magazine going to 2 million eyeballs, it's the same thing as now buying programmatic ads online, like blinking banners that are 26 cents a thousand on a Generic site showing you generic ads. They just don't work. I relate the old circulation models to that. And a lot of the magazines, I think today have gotten better at that and trying to go after those better audiences. But that's been our foundation from day one. And that allowed us to come out of nowhere and become successful in a very tough competitive market.
  Speaker 2
  Can you tell the origin story of media jet and what it was like in the early days to go buy up that distribution? What was the actual process of building what you have today, which I think anyone listening is going to agree like, wow, it sure does seem incredibly valuable to own the rack in all these Places where the highest end customer is frequenting and picking up your thing. That's really valuable. And I know a lot of copies go through there who cares how it's measured. Everyone would agree it's valuable now. But I'm really curious to hear the story of how you built it up and what the stages of that were and what lessons you learned doing it.
  Speaker 1
  We had to buy her way in and it's still very expensive. We've locked into really long-term contracts. We've been doing it so long. But it was this amazing thing that happened. We started at no seven and it was tough. They were resistant. They didn't know if they wanted them. It was hand-in-hand combat to get an FBO to even agree. And then the crash happens and private aviation. I think you remember the president was maligning people flying privately. Well, all of a sudden FBOs started to really hurt. And we got a call from an FBO group and they're like, we want more newsstands. They're like, well, that's great, but we can't afford to pay you. It's a crappy economy and you're expensive. He's like, oh, don't worry about the money. Our passengers love your magazines because it was all my magazines. The great story was we had FBOs saying when no one was flying, they would have their big customers who had jets there going, hey, box up those magazines that have sent them to me. I mean, they're cheap. They'... ([Time 0:10:49](https://share.snipd.com/snip/679bfa4a-7964-4751-8a02-8f1fd7f730de))
    - **Note:** Don’t buy bulk eyeballs but build a quality business. Find secret weapons. What can you build on top of your media business to make it much bigger. Take the base platform but what can you build on top. They were trusted partner in the industry and so used their platform to build tools. Like anna wintour building a saas fashion too it gets her in the door with her credibility they wanted to use their platform to build tools to help not just monetize ads. because of his credibility, he was able to walk into big fashion magazines and sit down with all the decision makers to hear about their pain points and tell them about their product and their partners trusted them and listened because his magazines have been giving them good press for 50 years
- Innovative Business Model for Manufacturers
  Summary:
  The speaker devised a unique business model where they offered manufacturers free data structuring, warehousing, and lead generation services in return for a pay-per-transaction fee for connecting them with designers.
  This innovative approach eliminated the need for sampling, warehouses, and manual follow-ups for salespeople, streamlining the process. By leveraging their established media platform for customer acquisition, the speaker successfully created a model that satisfied both the supply and demand sides of the marketplace, addressing the challenging aspects of digital business such as customer acquisition costs and lifetime value.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And I started to talk to manufacturers like, I've got an idea. I'll take every piece of material, every piece of data, I'll do all the data work myself, don't lift a finger. I will literally build and normalize your data structure and put it on my website, no cost. I'll take every sample you have, bring an 18 wheeler, back it up to my building, I will load it into my warehouse, no cost. I want X dollars every time I find a designer that I've qualified that says I love that carpet, I want the carpet, I'll FedEx it overnight, I'll put all of that data right into your CRM. So your salesman does not have to do anything to wake up, have his coffee, and go, who got my samples? Who do I follow up with? And I'll charge you transactionally, I'll charge you cost per action. So manufacturers are saying, wait a minute, no sampling, no warehouses, no nothing. No, you're just going to put leads into my CRM and I'll pay you transaction like Google. Done. So we were able to build a model that supply and demand sides of the marketplace, we're very happy with. And because of that media platform that I spent the prior 20 years building, I had access to customer acquisition, which is again, talk about the hardest thing in any business with digital, Your customer acquisition costs, your lifetime value.

    - **Note:** They did something in next day shipping that seemed crazy people spent 12% of revenue on samples they fixed this by creating a way to ship and ship back overnight then they built and integrated crm so you know who got the samples to follow up with and like google you didn’t pay 10 cents per click but you paid $2 per sale. You can order 25 different things at midnight and get filled because they’re in Memphis with fedex who is the only person who could execute logistically. They did something incredibly hard built out their own fulfilment realized they needed to built it in specific place and this gave them amazing power.
