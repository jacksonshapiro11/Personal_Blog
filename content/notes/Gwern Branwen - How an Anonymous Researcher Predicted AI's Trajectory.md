### Highlights

- Harness the Power of Rabbit Holing
  Summary:
  Editing Wikipedia served as a foundational training experience, far surpassing formal education in developing writing and research skills.
  It transformed passive exploration into structured learning by allowing the synthesis of knowledge into comprehensive articles. While the evolving nature of Wikipedia now poses challenges for in-depth contributions, the spirit of self-empowerment and engagement remains vital.
  An alternative platform that mirrors this empowerment could nurture the passions of rabbit hole enthusiasts, encouraging them to contribute meaningful content without the fear of dismissal or deletion.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  What were you doing with all these rabbit holes before you started blogging? Was there a place where you would compile them? Before I started blogging, I was editing Wikipedia.
  Speaker 1
  That was really kind of Gorn.net before Gorn.net. Everything I do now with my site, I would have done on English Wikipedia. And if you go and read some of the articles, I'm still very proud of them, like the Wikipedia article on Fujiwara and Notega. And you would, you know, think pretty quickly to yourself, you're reading this like, ah, yes, you know, Gwern wrote this, didn't he?
  Speaker 2
  Is it fair to say that the training required to make Gwern.net happened on Wikipedia?
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, I think so. I've learned far more from editing Wikipedia than I learned from any of my school or college training. Everything I end up learning about writing, I learned by editing on Wikipedia.
  Speaker 2
  Honestly, it sounds like Wikipedia is a great training ground. If you wanted to make a thousand more words, we should just – this is where we train them.
  Speaker 1
  I think building something like an alternative to Wikipedia could be a good training ground. For me, it was beneficial to combine rabbit holing with Wikipedia because on Wikipedia, you know, they generally would not have many good articles on the thing that I was currently In this rabbit hole on. Kind of passive experience of rabbit holing and being obsessed with something and learning about it, where you just read everything you can about the topic to kind of compiling that And synthesizing it onto Wikipedia. You go from piecemeal, kind of like a little bit here, there, picking up different things to writing full articles. And once you're able to get to the point where you're writing full Wikipedia articles that are good and summarize all your work, now you can go off on your own and pursue entirely different Kinds of writing now that you've like learned to complete things and get them across the finish line, it would be pretty difficult to do that with the current English Wikipedia. It's objectively just a much larger Wikipedia than it was back in, in like 2004. Um, not only are there far more articles filled in at this point, um, the editing community is also just much more hostile to content contribution, particularly like very detailed, Obsessive, rabbit-holey kind of research projects. They would just like delete it or tell you that, you know, it's not good for original research or that you're not using approved sources. Possibly you'd have someone who just kind of decided to get their jollies that day by deleting large swaths of your specific articles. That, of course, is going to make you like very angry and make you probably just want to quit and leave before you really get going. So I don't quite know how you would figure out this alternative to Wikipedia, one that kind of like empowers the rabbit holer as much as the old Wikipedia did. When you're an editor with Wikipedia, you have this very empowered attitude because you know that anything in it could be wrong and you could be the one to fix it. If you see something that doesn't make sense to you, that could be an opportunity for an edit. That was at least the wiki attitude. Anyone could fix it and anyone, right, includes you. When you were an editor on Wikipedia, was that your full-time occupation? It would eat basically as much time in my life as I let it. I could easily spend eight hours a day reviewing edits and improving articles while I was rabbit-holing. But otherwise, I would just neglect it and only review the most suspicious diffs and articles that I was particularly interested in on my kind of like watch list.
  Speaker 2
  And was this while you were at university or after?
  Speaker 1
  I got started in Wikipedia in like late middle school, possibly early high school. It was kind of funny. I like started skipping lunch in the cafeteria and just going to the computer lab in the library and like alternating between Neopets and Wikipedia. Yeah, I had like Neopets in one tab and then my like Wikipedia watch list is coming in on the other.
  Speaker 2
  And then were there any other kids in middle school or high school who are into this kind of stuff? ([Time 0:43:00](https://share.snipd.com/snip/be66a87e-9b67-4877-aed0-8236e252f0a4))

- The Value of Library Stacks and Creative Discovery
  Summary:
  The longing for immersive physical experiences in libraries reveals a deep appreciation for the serendipitous discoveries made among obscure texts.
  Engaging with literature, especially sci-fi, can be life-changing, but the majority of fiction may lack genuine value; only a select few works convey profound insights, particularly those featuring non-human intelligence. Notably, the complexity of literature often requires time to fully appreciate, as many insights only crystallize after prolonged contemplation.
  Meanwhile, a perceived intelligence can stem from the ability to synthesize knowledge over years, though true understanding often lies hidden in the gradual buildup of experiences.
  Ultimately, the rewarding synthesis of ideas from diverse sources can produce seemingly magical outcomes, akin to the meticulous effort behind an illusionist's trick.

  Speaker 1
  I think if the internet didn't exist, I would have tried to probably make it in regular academia and maybe narrow my interests a lot more, something I could publish on regularly. Or I could possibly have tried to opt out, you know, and become a librarian, like one of my favorite writers, Jorge Luis Borges. He was a librarian until he succeeded as a writer. Of course, I've always agreed with him about Imagining Paradise as a kind of library. I regret that all the reading I do is now kind of on the computer, and I don't get to spend as much time in libraries, physical libraries. I genuinely love them, just like pouring through the stacks, looking for random stuff. Some of the best times for me when I was in university were always like going through these gigantic stacks of all sorts of obscure books and just looking at like a random spine, you know, Pulling stuff off the shelf and reading obscure old technical journals to see all the strange and wonderful things that they were doing and documenting back then, which now have just Been totally forgotten.
  Speaker 2
  If you could ask Borges one question, what would it be?
  Speaker 1
  Oh, um, he's a real hero of mine. Um, so this is, this isn't something I want to have a bad answer to. Can I ask why he's a hero of yours? When I was younger, one of the science fiction books that really impressed me was Dan Simmons' Hyperion and especially The Fall of Hyperion. In there he alludes to Kevin Kelly's Out of Control book which strongly features the parable of the Library of Babel. From there, I got the kind of collected editions of Borges' fiction and nonfiction, and I just read through them again and again. I was blown away by the fact that you could be so creative with all of this polymathic knowledge that he had in erudition and write these wonderful, entertaining, provocative short Stories and essays. And I thought to myself, if I could be like any writer, any writer at all, I would not mind being Borges.
  Speaker 2
  Borges has a short poem called Borges and I, where he talks about how he doesn't identify with the version of himself that is actually doing the writing and publishing all this great Work.
  Speaker 1
  And I don't know if you identify with that at all. Yeah, I think when I was a kid, I did not understand that essay, but I think I understand it now.
  Speaker 2
  What are other pieces of literature that you encountered where now you really understand what they were getting at, but you didn't when you first came across them?
  Speaker 1
  Ted Chang's story of your life comes to mind. I completely blew understanding it the first time that I read it. I had to get a lot more context where I could actually go back and understand what his point was. Gene Wolfe's Suzanne delage um story was also a complete mystery to me it took like 14 years to actually understand it but i'm very proud of that one specifically that was a very recent One oh and then what did you figure out about suzanne delage yeah so gene wolf suzanne delage uh is a very very short story about this guy remembering not meeting a woman in his local town And thinking, oh, that's kind of strange. That's the whole story. Nobody has any idea what it means, even though we're told that it means something. And Gene Wolfe, the author, is a genius writer, but nobody could figure it out for like 40 years. Last year, I figured it out. It out it's actually a subtle retelling of Dracula, where Dracula invades the town and steals the woman from him. He's been brainwashed by Dracula in a very Bram Stoker way to forget it all. And every single part of the story is told by what's not said in the narrator's recollection. It's incredible. It's the only story I know which is so convincingly written by what's not in it.
  Speaker 2
  That's crazy that you figured that out. The Ted Chiang story, the story of your life, can you remind me what that one's about?
  Speaker 1
  The surface story is just about a bunch of weird aliens who come to Earth.
  Speaker 2
  Oh, right, right. It's the same plot as Arrival.
  Speaker 1
  They have this weird language which didn't have a sense of time. The narrator learned to see the future and then the aliens left.
  Speaker 2
  And then what was it that you realized about that story?
  Speaker 1
  The first time I read it, it struck me as a kind of stupid ESP story about seeing the future. Very stupid, boring, kind of standard conventionalism, verbose, and like dragging in much kind of like irrelevant physics only a while after i you know first read it i was thinking About it i understand that it was not about time travel or being able to see the future you know it's instead about a totally alien kind of mind um that's equally valid in its own way in which You see everything is part of an already determined story heading to a predestined end. This turned out to be mathematically equivalent and equally powerful as our conventional view of the world. Events marching one by one to an unknown and changing future. That was a case where Chang was just writing it too high level for me to understand. I pattern matched it to some much more common kind of stupid story.
  Speaker 2
  How do you think about the value of reading fiction versus nonfiction?
  Speaker 1
  I think you could definitely spend the rest of your life reading fiction and not benefit whatsoever from it. Other than having memorized a lot of trivia about things that people made up. I tend to be pretty cynical about the benefits of fiction. Most fiction is not written to make you better in any way.
  Speaker 2
  It's written just to entertain you or exist and to fill up time. But it sounds like your own ideas have benefited a lot from the sci-fi that you read.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, but it's extremely little sci-fi in the grand scheme of things, right? Easily 99% of the sci-fi I read was just completely useless to me. I could have easily cut it down to 20 novels or short stories, which actually were good enough and insightful enough to actually change my view. I mean, one volume, for instance, of Blindsight by Peter Watts is worth all 100 Xanth novels or all 500 expanded universe novels of Star Wars.
  Speaker 2
  The ones you did find insightful the top 20 or so what did they have in common i i would say that the characteristic they have is that they all take non-human intelligence seriously um
  Speaker 1
  It doesn't seem to you know it doesn't have to be artificial intelligence necessarily uh it's taking the idea of non-human intelligence seriously and not imagining your classic sci-fi Scenario of humans kind of like going out into the galaxy with ray guns the sort of thing where you have rockets and ray guns but you don't have cell phones um people complain that the singularity Is is a sort of like boring overused sci-fi trope but if you went out and actually grabbed random books of science fiction that are out there, you would find that like less than 1% contain Anything remotely like that, right? Or have any kind of relevance to the current context that we actually face with AI. Do people ([Time 0:54:34](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a1ba1920-5043-4959-9136-797c1c2b6a6d))
    - **Note:** Reading writing and doing. The short stories he liked. The lack of value he finds in fiction. How he’s not very smart but he thinks so much and he’ll work on a piece for 10 years constantly drawing things from disparate parts unlocking new ideas over years to come together for one big production.
