He took 10 years to graduate college as a marketer worked for uniliver selling toothpaste but didn’t want to do it anymore and he’s near 40 and finds this energy drink in Thailand and realizes how it’s cash cow and dedicated his life to it.

  Speaker 1
  He's like, you might not buy my vacuum cleaner, but you're sure as hell going to notice it and matches to the same thing where he made the can. I think everybody seen what a Red Bull can looks like. No, another can look like that back then. Now some have copied this, but he made that tall, slim can with the intention of looking different and standing out from every single other thing that would be on the same shelf. And one hilarious little story is Red Bull has its own private like aircraft fleet. It's called the flying bulls, they use them for a bunch of events. The can holders in those planes only hold cans the size of Red Bull. I thought that was cool. I also thought it was cool when asked, he was asked like why he did that. And Dietrich said everything is marketing. Let's go back to this focus that he has. He puts all of his energy behind, you know, one arrow. I sell Red Bull. I sell energy drink called Red Bull in a can. Might have a couple different variations, but I don't do anything else but that. And so as the brand got more and more popular, he got assaulted with all these offers to like, hey, let's license it. We can make Red Bull gummy bears and we can make Red Bull underwear and Red Bull perfume. And he said no to every single one. He does not want to use the Red Bull brand for anything else but to sell the actual energy drink to sell cans of Red Bull. All marketing is just made to sell more energy drinks. And so I found this fact in a couple different places. ([Time 0:42:37](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b294e5de-c523-46bb-9c8e-0499c950c6a1))
    - **Note:** He never wanted to liscense tried other products but stuck with Red Bull eventually as the core focus above everything. To win you must first survive he didn’t take a dividend for 15 years plowed into growth until the company was secure first don’t lose than win never wanted to be in a bad position now gets 600mm dividends a year. Differentiation is survival all his marketing events were weird and unique understood the influencer model before anyone else did. His events were his marketing. He doesn’t believe what he learning at business school constantly wanting to integrate marketing into the wider system don’t advertise on sports jerseys but own the team. Never motivated by money just wanted freedom and independence journey is the destination you need to love the climb. He built his own hq but creating a town like brunelo and never wanted to go public or get married
