### Highlights

- By "muddy heathen mysticisms," I think he means postmodernism. Even though the word hadn’t been coined yet, C.S. Lewis must have felt the chilly winds of relativism blowing in his direction in 1939. He could see the future: an age where men believed nothing, held no standards, and had minds weak as twigs lost in a storm. Trying to live like a relativist is like trying to walk without gravity. Coherent acts are only possible in the polarity of good and bad. We can argue about the position of the poles, but if we erase the poles, then we’ll be lost in a maddening universe with no up or down.
  Lewis says that the soul feeds on truth and beauty like the body feeds on food: "God makes no appetite in vain. We can therefore pursue knowledge and beauty in the sure conﬁdence that by so doing we are either advancing to the vision of God ourselves or indirectly helping others to do so."

    - **Note:** We need to stand for something and believe something
- Bottomline: Don’t wait for spare time to know what you want to know and to chase what you want to chase. C.S. Lewis: "The only people who achieve much are those who want knowledge so badly that they seek it while the conditions are still unfavorable. Favorable conditions never come."
