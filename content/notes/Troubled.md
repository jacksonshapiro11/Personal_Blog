- Summary: The concept of "luxury beliefs," which are ideas that confer status on the upper class at little cost while often harming the lower classes, was developed by the author. Affluent people often hold these beliefs, such as advocating for sexual promiscuity or abolishing the police, to distinguish themselves from the masses. Elite colleges are crucial for induction into the luxury belief class, and they encourage students to nurture grievances and block mobility for those who don't have the time or means to keep up with the latest intellectual fads.

### Highlights

- Thorstein Veblen’s famous “leisure class” has evolved into the “luxury belief class.” Veblen, an economist and sociologist, made his observations about social class in the late nineteenth century. He compiled his observations in his classic 1899 book, The Theory of the Leisure Class. A key idea is that because we can’t be certain of the financial standing of other people, a good way to size up their means is to see whether they can afford to waste money on goods and leisure. This explains why status symbols are so often difficult to obtain and costly to purchase. In Veblen’s day, people exhibited their status with delicate and restrictive clothing like tuxedos, top hats, and evening gowns, or by partaking in time-consuming activities like golf or beagling. Such goods and leisurely activities could only be purchased or performed by those who did not live the life of a manual laborer and could spend time learning something with no practical utility. Veblen even goes so far as to say, “The chief use of servants is the evidence they afford of the master’s ability to pay.” For Veblen, even butlers were status symbols.
  Veblen proposed that the wealthy flaunt these symbols not because they are useful, but because they are so pricey or wasteful that only the wealthy can afford them, which is why they’re high-status indicators. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq0zhw290edkcp2nvm7m16d6))

- When someone uses the phrase cultural appropriation, what they are really saying is, “I was educated at a top college.” Consider the Veblen quote, “Refined tastes, manners, habits of life are a useful evidence of gentility, be- cause good breeding requires time, application and expense, and can therefore not be compassed by those whose time and energy are taken up with work.” Only the affluent can afford to learn strange vocabulary, because ordinary people have real problems to worry about.
  The chief purpose of luxury beliefs is to indicate the believer’s social class and education. When an affluent person expresses sup- port for defunding the police, drug legalization, open borders, loot- ing, or permissive sexual norms, or uses terms like white privilege, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq0z36kwnvevgb9fzwb36wvc))

    - **Note:** luxury beliefs are like veblin goods ideas you can hold that you don't believe to show you were educated in an area and learned about these things. These are invented problems much like luxury goods signal status of wasting your time trying to understand these things instead of learning something actually useful with your life. You forfeit intellectual use to display you are of so high status you can waste your time and brain. Any ideas they hold like defunding the police supported by wealthier people make them feel good like they are helping these poor people who turned to a life of crime but they are really fucking the poor people who don't commit crimes and creating a huge negative incentive for progress why play by the rules when you always get bailed out and its more profitable not to. Luxury beliefs trickle down where they are bad ideas but can't effect the wealthy because they have so many outs and flexibility in life, but the poor who they foist these on don't have the means and this really fucks them over

- Many of my peers at Yale and Stanford would work ceaselessly. But when I’d ask them about the plans they’d implemented to get into college, or start a company, or land their dream job, they’d often suggest they just got lucky rather than attribute their success to their efforts. Interestingly, it seems like many people who earn status by working hard are able to boost their status among their peers even more by saying they just got lucky. This isn’t just limited to my own observations, either. A 2019 study found that people with high income and social status are the most likely to attribute success to mere luck rather than hard work.
  24 Both luck and hard work play a role in the direction of our lives, but stressing the former at the expense of the latter doesn’t help those at or near the bottom of society. If disadvantaged people come to believe that luck is the key factor that determines success, then they will be less likely to strive to improve their lives. One study tracked more than six thousand young adults in the US at the beginning of their careers over the course of two decades, and found that those who believed that life’s outcomes are due to their own efforts as opposed to external factors became more successful in their careers and went on to attain higher earnings.
