### Highlights

- Episode AI notes
  1. Firms must prioritize operational value-add over pricing in order to compete effectively in a market characterized by auction-like deal-making.
  2. Success in Series C and growth equity investments increasingly depends on genuine operational support from investors, beyond the superficial enhancements typically provided by limited partners.
  3. The emergence of crossover and mega funds, along with advancements in large language models (LLMs), is transforming the knowledge dynamics within venture capital.
  4. Investors are encouraged to utilize large language models to improve their knowledge quotient (KQ) and stay competitive in the investment landscape.
  5. As intelligence becomes more widely accessible, judgment quotient (JQ) will become a key factor for evaluating team quality, particularly in early funding rounds.
  6. Venture capitalists who can integrate judgment quotient (JQ) with emotional quotient (EQ) will gain a significant edge in decision-making and assessing team capabilities. ([Time 0:00:00](https://share.snipd.com/episode-takeaways/e9bfad71-c3de-4b6d-bd2d-95ff411167e3))
- Operational Excellence is the Key Differentiator
  Summary:
  In a competitive landscape dominated by auction-like deal-making, firms must shift focus from pricing to operational value-add to stand out.
  Success in Series C and growth equity increasingly relies on genuine operational support, rather than superficial enhancements often seen from limited partners. The rise of crossover and mega funds, alongside advancements in large language models (LLMs), has reshaped the knowledge base within venture capital, making it crucial for investors to leverage LLMs to enhance their own knowledge quotient (KQ).
  As intelligence becomes democratized, judgment quotient (JQ) will emerge as a critical differentiator for assessing team quality, especially in early funding stages.
  VCs who can effectively combine JQ and emotional quotient (EQ) will hold a significant advantage in decision-making and team evaluation.

  There's no sourcing advantage. There's no pricing advantage. In fact, there's a pricing disadvantage. Because the highest bidder wins. You're just the highest bidder. Everything's an auction. Literally every deal that these big firms do is an auction. So where they compete and differentiate is on an operational value add. And I think that is where Series C and growth equity is heading. And it's not just in its true operational value add. You know, I've spoken about this, you know, like, I think Valor does this really do it, you know, really hard operational problems. It's not just helping with HR, helping with PR. It's not the LP window dressing operational support teams. It's a real operational support. And I think that is where the world of growth equity is heading and evolving. But that's almost because of, in some ways, the combination of the rise of crossover funds and mega funds that would have happened absent LLM's. I do think LLM's are just going to make the knowledge part of venture so much more democratized. I think about IQ, EQ, and then there's KQ, knowledge quotient. And now it's going to really help to have a really deep differentiated domain knowledge database, but you're going to have to work hard with an LLM to take your IQ from whatever it is up 30 points. Because people who you had between your combination IQ and KQ, you had 30 points on them. Now they're at your level unless you use an LLM. But I just think it will really, for a while, place the emphasis on JQ, judgment quotient. Almost maybe for A's and B's, the most important skill will simply be assessing team quality. And maybe that's that five to ten-year window where VCs can still differentiate in the same way fundamental investors, maybe I hope will be able to take some alpha share from quantitative Investors because of the limbs. But just it will be all about JQ at the C, the A and B and some combination of JQ and EQ is this person exceptional. But I don't know, it's just a hypothesis.
