### Highlights

- **Human Intelligence and Cultural Evolution**
  * Human intelligence isn't solely responsible for our survival; cultural evolution plays a crucial role.
  * Brain size has decreased over the past 10,000 years, potentially due to specialization and a collective brain.
  * The skills favored by evolution fall within a narrow range: not so useful they become instinct, nor so useless they're not worth learning.
  * Environmental change rate influences the balance between genetic, individual, and cultural learning. In a static environment learning can be encoded in genes but in a fast environment human ability to acquire knowledge quickly is vital. 
  * IQ scores may reflect cognitive abilities for navigating specific institutional environments, not generalized intelligence.

  Dwarkesh Patel
  I had this independent researcher, an internet writer called Gwern Branwen on my podcast a couple months ago. And we were discussing AI and I asked him, so his theory is very much like the brain became bigger, more intelligence. And so then I asked him like, look, if it's this simple, why did it take so long for evolution to discover intelligence in the first place? And he had this interesting answer, which is that there's a very narrow, in terms of like the signal that evolution is giving you, there's a very narrow gap between skills that are so Useful that they should like just be distilled as an instinct into your genome, and then skills that are so worthless that they're not worth learning in the first place. And so this narrow gap that's like you need that generalization ability. Like it's like not so primal that like, you know, you're not going to culturally learn hunger. You're just going to be in your genome. I don't know if that sounds like an interesting explanation or helps explain anything.
  Joseph Henrich
  Well, I mean, in cultural evolutionary models, there are a typical thing would be to let genes compete with individual learning to compete with cultural learning. And it turns out the rate of change of the environment affects that. So if the environment is changing slowly, then you should put it all in the genes. And if it's changing a moderate speed, then culture is the best way to go. And if it's fast, then individual learning. And the idea of the individual learning is favored because if it's changing too quickly, the previous generation doesn't know anything worth knowing because the world you're dealing With is just so much different from their world. And so it's this intermediate range. So myself and others have argued that the increase in the frequency of change during the Plyoplystocene transition 2.5 million years ago is a change that increases the value of cultural Transmission of learning from others. I'm not sure what your guest was thinking. I mean, but as our brains are not very good at solving problems, otherwise the lost European explorers could survive. And human brain size has been declining for the last 10,000 years. So we've actually been getting dumber. Fewer neurons, less computational power. Yeah.
  Dwarkesh Patel
  Why has brain size been declining?
  Joseph Henrich
  Well, the collective brain argument suggests that at a certain size, you'll begin farming off specialists. So because there's a store of knowledge in the society and we can all be generalists and learn how to do all the different skills. But at some point, it makes efficiency sense for us to specialize in different skills. In order for that to be the case, though, we have to have social agreements of some sort that allow us to trade or exchange things like that. But then once we're specializing, we don't necessarily need as large a brain because we distribute the overall brain power amongst the society. So it could be that we're becoming more of a superorganism. And you see the same thing in ants. When ants get specialized occupational casts, their individual brains shrink. Interesting.
  Dwarkesh Patel
  What do you make of, I think David Reich's lab had a result a month or two ago where they showed that the selective pressure on at least the European samples, which is the samples they studied, Was that there's been selection for greater intelligence over the last 10,000 years. I don't know if you saw that or what you make of that.
  Joseph Henrich
  Well, they didn't say anything about intelligence. They did use the polygenic score for education. Yeah. Yeah. So, but there was no education 8,000 years ago. Yeah, it's correlated. Yeah. But then the question is, is we don't know what goes into that, right? Is that actually computational software? Or, I mean, people do well in school because they stick to it and they can sit in the same place for long periods of time.
  Dwarkesh Patel
  I guess it would be interesting for them to sort of deduct the docility polygenic score from the education. Because we don't have a polygenic score for intelligence yet, right? Well, there are IQ.
  Joseph Henrich
  So there are polygenic scores for IQ. I think they actually did that one as well. Like you said, it's correlated with education. And yeah, but that doesn't have anything that the things that go into giving you an IQ, I mean, the correlation between brain size and IQ is only about, well, across populations, it's 0.24. So,'s not very big. So the other thing is, I mean, IQ is massively misunderstood. So the way to think about IQ, which has been going up over the 20th century by quite a bit. So if you rescale modern scores to 1900, it's about 70. It's called the Flynn effect. I think that those are cognitive abilities for navigating the institutional world that we've constructed. And a huge mistake would be to assume that those are the right cognitive abilities for the next century. So it'll be a different constellation. If you study, we study herders and cognitive abilities of herders in Northern Namibia. And if you're in Northern Namibia, you got to be able to move through the landscape. So being able to just pick a direction and know where you're going and not get lost is super important. So different suites of cognitive abilities are favored in different environments. This idea that there's this generalized thing applicable across all human environments just doesn't – I mean education massively increases your IQ, right?
  Dwarkesh Patel
  If you're uneducated, you have a totally different IQ. And then is the way in which your horsepower is directed, is that a thing that you think is basically set by the time you're an adult? Or like if somebody's 30 now and the AI thing is going to happen next and they have to like totally reorient away from knowledge work, is that a thing?
  Joseph Henrich
  Well, so I think it's a continuous scale. So if you look at human brains, they're developing and continuing to add new connections and stuff at least into the mid-20s. Now, there could be even more plasticity after that. Unlike chimps, we're still not totally myelinized for our whole lives. So there's definitely room. It's just there's less room.

- **The Church's Unintentional Revolution**
  * The Catholic Church inadvertently triggered massive social and economic change in Europe by dismantling intensive kinship systems.
  * This led to smaller, monogamous families, fostering individual mobility and the rise of new institutions like guilds and universities. 
  * The shift away from kin-based structures promoted individual contracts, urbanization, and idea flow, ultimately contributing to the Industrial Revolution. 
  * Practices like outlawing polygyny and cousin marriage, and allowing testamentary inheritance, weakened traditional family structures and empowered individuals.
  * People used to live on farm with family. Then the importance of tending the land went down. Created a new way to organize society from primitive ways.
  * The church created cities less family ties released only learning from families so you learned from the best in cities increased free flow of ideas from best people and most improvement.
  * Learning isn’t siloed but free so the most capable people can pick up where the last generation left off because the church scaled trust.

  Dwarkesh Patel
  Okay. So we've been dancing around this, the thesis of your book following the secret, which is the weirdest people in the world. And before we just sort of like really jump into it, maybe you can give me a summary of what the thesis there is. Yeah.
  Joseph Henrich
  So the first observation is that there's a great deal of global psychological variation around the world. So European, American, Australian populations tend to be highly individualistic. They're inclined towards analytic thinking over holistic thinking. They have a lot of impersonal prosociality, so trust in strangers. They're against conformity, willingness to cooperate with strangers. So the question is, how can we explain the global variation in these features of psychology? And towards the end of the book, I actually connect these features of the psychology to economic differences, including the industrial revolution that happened in Europe, which Reshapes the world. And the story is, is that the key event is the spread of a particular form of Christianity into Europe where the Catholic Church, what becomes the Catholic Church, systematically dismantles The intensive kinship systems in Europe, leading to small monogamous nuclear families. And this transformation leads to the creation of new institutions. So by the high Middle Ages, you get the rise of guilds, which are voluntary groups of craftsmen and self-help societies because people don't have their families to rely on. People begin moving around. There's occupational sorting into different occupations. You get urbanization is rising. Charter towns are on the rise. Universities pop up. New kinds of monasteries pop up. And then Europe begins to urbanize. And you get new kinds of law that are based around the individual contract law. And then eventually this leads to a lot more innovation because ideas are flowing around Europe and then eventually the Industrial Revolution. So that's the argument in a nutshell.
  Dwarkesh Patel
  Can you explain again what exactly the church did which led to the kin-based existing system breaking down?
  Joseph Henrich
  Yeah. So the church outlaws polygyny. And so that stops elite males from having multiple wives and concubines and whatnot and creating kind of a giant family through that. It outlaws cousin marriage, going all the way out to sixth cousins at some point, and that included spiritual kin and other kinds of sort of non-genetic relatives as well as the cousins. It frees up inheritance, so it has inheritance by testimony rather than normal patrilineal inheritance. And a simple example here is in most societies, you inherit access to land corporately. So which means you and your brothers and stuff all own the land. And it might be your uncle is actually in charge of the land, your father's brother. And so you can't sell it. You can't move it around. And you're also tied to it. It's where your ancestors are buried. And so there's this big importance of land. So the church allows people to give land to the church. The church becomes the largest landowner in Europe because you can do it by testament. So those are just some of the examples of the ways it transforms the family structure. And eventually you get these monogamous nuclear families, which are basically unheard of around the world, at least if you look at the anthropological record. And you can really see this when you can compare. Individuals can move to European cities as individuals or nuclear families. In China, when you move to the city, you maintain contacts with the folks back home in the village, and people flow back and forth. And you get these little enclaves of different clans and stuff in the cities, the connections. And this is really important because you're ancestors and there's rituals that have to be done back in the home community. But Christianity does away with all those ancestor rituals. Okay, great.
  Dwarkesh Patel
  Let's jump into it by starting before the, much before even the church. I wonder how much of the things that, let's say, make Europe weird existed even in antiquity. If you read about how Roman society worked or how these Greek polities worked, already you have emphasis on nuclear families. You have these sort of universal norms around, hey, we believe in republicanism or we believe in democracy. The structure of the system matters more necessarily than, I guess, at least before the empire, right? So, yeah, was Europe already weird before the things this church did?
  Joseph Henrich
  Well, there were certainly some interesting things going on in Greece and Rome, but I don't think there's good evidence that you had the kinds of monogamous nuclear families that you Would find later. I mean, even European law is built around patrilineage. So if your father's still alive, you are not a full citizen. You're in the patra house, so these large families. Definitely intensive kinship for sure, patrilineal, patrilocal. Women, of course, don't have any rights. And, you know, republicanism, but the formation of Rome is built around a series of elite families. So it's a clan operation. And they call it republican because the clans all have some say in what's going on. So people sometimes see representative government where it's not really individuals being represented, but families. And so this fools a lot of people into thinking there was a lot more individualistic voting and things like that. There's actually no voting. But yeah. So in Greece, in Athens, Athens is unique because it does a bunch of things in the laws of Solon that break down the intensive kinship. So for example, in Greece, you get monogamy for the first time, and Athens is considered unusual. So, males can only marry one Athenian woman, which has potentially positive effects among the competition among Athenian men, but they can have as many slave concubines ([Time 0:45:05](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c875c421-a990-41ae-8eee-e5bcea8be9cb))
- **Cultural Effects on Innovation**
  * Cultural background significantly influences individual choices, even in areas like innovation and economic behavior.
  * Growing up in specific cultural environments shapes one's likelihood of pursuing certain fields.
  * Cultural diversity fuels innovation, as demonstrated by the impact of immigration on US patents between 1850 and 1940.
  * Integrating individuals from culturally distant societies takes time, especially if they come from low-trust backgrounds.
  * Despite the assimilation process, culturally diverse perspectives enhance creative thinking and problem-solving. Value patience reciprocity and altruism. This is why the western mindset has performed so well.
  Transcript:
  Joseph Henrich
  Yeah, he doesn't actually fit any cultural evolutionary models. And if you include that people are learning from parents and learning from their social milieu, your parents determine where you are in the social milieu. So you're surrounded by people who are being more patient and behaving in certain economic ways. And that's going to have a huge effect. I just told you about how if you grow up in Silicon Valley, you're going to patent in computers.
  Dwarkesh Patel
  It's not because you have genes for computers. Yeah. Given the persistence of these cultural effects, how should that change how we think about whether it makes sense to have more immigration from societies that are already weird or Whether that matters or not. Right.
  Joseph Henrich
  So we have a paper under review right now in which we show that from 1850 roughly to 1940, a big driver of U.S. Innovation, both the quality and quantity of patents, is the cultural diversity of counties. And we actually use immigration as a kind of way of showing the causal effect of this. So what you want is a lot of cultural variation. Now, if you get people from societies that are more distant from whatever the current US culture is at the time, it's going to take more time until they're able to fully integrate. So if they're coming from very distrusting society, they're not going to be able to latch into the collective brain immediately. So you see this in early, in around 1900, there's data from people mostly coming from Southern Italy and coming from Germany and Britain. And the Southern Italians are coming from a society that has a high distrust of strangers. So their immediate effect on the patenting system is low. But the strength of these cultural traits seems to go down by an order of magnitude each generation. So the second generation, you can still see where they came from. But they're a lot more like the majority culture than their parents. And then it goes down another order of magnitude. So, yeah. So you just have to do more work essentially to assimilate people and culturate them. But the potential value of having diverse ways of thinking, different ideas can be really valuable, I think.
  Dwarkesh Patel
  What do you make of Garrett Jones? So Garrett Jones is an economist who has this, he calls this spaghetti theory of assimilation. I don't know if you've heard of this. The idea is basically like, look, immigrants do assimilate, but they also assimilate us. And so whatever cultural practices they have will, in proportion to their size of the population, have an effect on wherever they migrate to. And his example is like when Italians came to America, spaghetti, which is like traditionally an Italian dish, also became an American dish, right? So they assimilated American culture as well and make, you know, sub in like traits like trust or whatever there. Basically, this like sort of reciprocal assimilation has implications of whether we want immigration from non-weird societies. What do you make of that idea?
  Joseph Henrich
  So, I mean, I think that the spaghetti example is – or the pizza or spaghetti, both good examples, is a great thing, right? Because, I mean, American food is a fusion of cuisine from lots of societies, and that leads to quite good food. Same thing, you can see music. So things like jazz have African rhythms in them. And so rock and roll, you know, is along that lineage.
  Dwarkesh Patel
  But we don't want like – do we want the diversity in low trust and high trust?
  Joseph Henrich
  Well, but the question is do social interactional traits operate the same way as these things? And if you have ethnic enclaves, then you're going to get low trust in those ethnic enclaves. You get things like the mafia, right? So you don't want that. But if you had an immigration policy that distributed people, and in a high-trust society, you benefit by being higher trust because you can do things like collaborate and start companies And stuff, which you have to be high trust to do that. Otherwise, you don't do it in a very effective way. So there is a pressure for low trust people to become more high trust. But if you're in mostly high trust people, there's not an incentive for you to move down. So social interactional traits are different than things like food types.
  Dwarkesh Patel
  Yeah. In psychology, there's been this problem of the replication crisis where a lot of the main results are hard to re-replicate. And it's not clear how much of this is real science. Have you looked into how many of the results the weird results are based on of the differences in psychology between different populations and so forth? How much of that actually replicates?
  Joseph Henrich
  Yeah. I mean, my sense is it replicates quite well. So, you know, we published our paper in 2010 and in late 20 aughts, Armin Falk is an economist and a bunch of others, Achenbecker, Ben Anki published a paper where they measured economic Preferences in 80,000 people around the world. And that just showed big variation in things like patience, various kinds of reciprocity, altruism, so the kinds of things we would expect. And then other large-scale projects have similarly shown lots of variation.
  Dwarkesh Patel
  The groups we have today, which are not weird, when you study them, do you think that the ([Time 1:10:27](https://share.snipd.com/snip/652dcdd5-9200-4990-aad3-ddcb07b6f7a4))
