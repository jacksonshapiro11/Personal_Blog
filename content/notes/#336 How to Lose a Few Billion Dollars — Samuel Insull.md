  1. Sam Insol, considered one of the most significant figures in the electricity business alongside Thomas Edison, had a rise and fall that is detailed in the book 'Insol: The Rise and Fall of a Billionaire Utility Tycoon' by Forrest McDonald. Insol's career ended disastrously, serving as a cautionary tale about the dangers of overleveraging.
  2. Insol was a company and industry builder, working with Edison to invent every component of an electric generating and distribution system. He dedicated his life to making Edison's system work, creating a manufacturing industry, an engineering organization, and a central station industry.
  3. Sam Insol impressed Thomas Edison's chief engineer by showing extensive knowledge of Edison's business affairs in Europe and building a relationship through acts of service. He dedicated every moment to helping with the European telephone exchange project and eventually gained the engineer's familiarity.
  4. Insol's approach involved acquiring companies, talent, and customers, similar to mass production before Henry Ford. He cultivated relationships by buying companies, recruiting advisors, and rewarding them with stock. Acquiring new properties led to the talented executives who drove Insol's success.

  Speaker 1
  Next to Thomas Edison, Sam Insol is the name that you should remember as the most important and perhaps the most notorious person in the electricity business. That was an excerpt from the book I'm going to talk to you about today, which is Insol, the rise and fall of a billionaire utility tycoon and is written by Forrest McDonald. This is a very old book, it was first published in 1962, and what the book lays out is that Insol was not just a company builder, but he was actually an industry builder. So you could think of what Rockefeller was to oil, what Henry Ford was to the automobile, what JP Morgan was to finance, and what Carnegie was to steal, Sam Insol was to electricity. But unlike Rockefeller Ford, Morgan and Carnegie, Insol made terrible, drastic mistakes at the end of his career and he dies broke. And so for you and I, this is going to be one of the scariest books that we could talk about because the idea that you can be wildly successful, maybe the most successful businessman in The 1920s, have an amazing 53 year career and still be over leverage and risk everything and die with no money is absolutely terrifying. So I'm going to start with the relationship that he had with his father. Insol is born and raised in England. And what is most interesting is that he had all of his dad's positive traits and none of the negative ones. ([Time 0:01:52](https://share.snipd.com/snip/bbfaf2be-eacb-431d-bf0c-951e46466124))
    - **Note:** Sam invented an industry but got overlevered and went broke. Had his dads positive traits none of his negative was imaginative clever and enthusiastic but didn’t have energy practical sense and fortitude his dad was an intellectual but Sam was an workaholic and loved operating. Had near demonic energy. He was able to race through a large capacity of reading materials and go from particulars to generals grasped underlying principals so well he could shift them around and improve them with ease. He would pick up ancillary skills and work long into the night perfecting the skills to be more well rounded. He worked as a secretary for Thomas Edison and helped systematize his empire. Do the best you can with the opportunity in front of you because opportunity leads to more opportunity he is able to meet an influential editor at vanity fair working nights because his stenography came recommend because of his hard work. Greats powerful connection. Works all day and sleeps 4 hours and relationships run the world first you form a relationship and these people teach him valuable skills and gets comfortable around success people in his down time he read like a mad man his skill was to understand and systematize ideas. He turned a luxury product into a necessity in electricity.
- The Power of Service
  Key takeaways:
  - Sam insole knew more about Edison's business affairs in Europe than Colonel George did
  - Step one: learn everything about Edison
  - Step two: build a relationship by serving Edison's chief engineer
  - Sam insole spent every single minute with Johnson's engineers as they built the European telephone exchange in London
  - Sam insole's modus operandi is to learn every single aspect of the business
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  When Edison's chief engineer, his name is Edward Johnson, when Edison's chief engineer came from America to London to supervise the insulation of the first European telephone exchange, He found that Sam insole, who again is 19 at the time, he found that Sam insole knew more about Edison's business affairs in Europe than Colonel George did. And so if you think what was happening is this is really incredible. Step one, learn everything about Edison. Step two, build a relationship by serving Edison's chief engineer. So by this point, Edison's already insole's hero, right? So he's like, okay, I'm going to tie my fate. He thinks Edison is so special. He's like, we need to tie our fate together. How am I going to get a job? How can I work? How can I meet Thomas Edison? And so this is what he says. He's like, well, to do, I must do two things. I have to learn everything I could about the technical aspects of Edison's businesses. And I need to build a relationship with Johnson. And so how does he do that? Same way. He does acts of service. He doesn't ask for something. He's like, these people are really important. What can I do to help them? So he spends every single minute with Johnson's engineers as they're building this European telephone exchange in London, right? And he's like, he asked them a bunch of questions, but he'll do anything. He's like, hey, can I carry your pliers? Can I help you string wires? Every single aspect of the business is something that Sam does for his entire life. He probably knew more. I mean, he's the one that vertically integrated the electricity industry. So he definitely did. He knew every single aspect of the business. It's just his modus operandi and whatever he's, whatever he does. And you see it in 19 in this telephone business. And so after a few months of this, Johnson becomes familiar with them, right? ([Time 0:15:41](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6a07a723-0eae-4354-8c9e-3875cbd23091))
    - **Note:** Sam is a great employee but a rich client installs his son in Sam’s job and Sam gets fired he’s heartbroken, but had developed admiration for Edison from reading and gets a job at one of his English companies commits everything about us to memory to serve him and the company and one of Edison engineers. Johnson goes over there and relies on Insull. Sam learns everything he can about the company and Edison then offers to work for Johnson on the weekends this leads to Johnson realizing he’s special and giving him a job and raising him in the organization. Do everything and you will win. He gets on a boat to work with Edison as his private secretary with no pay or job description. To seal the job he reads all of Edison’s European contracts and sends Johnson weekly status reports this clinches the deal. Doubting yourself is very dangerous he couldn’t imagine his own failure even though everyone told him he was crazy.
- Systematizing Business and Industry Building
  Key takeaways:
  - Insol had a pathological hostility to external order and discipline
  - He wanted others to build a business around him but not control how he spent his time
  - Insol was an industry builder like Carnegie, Rockefeller, and Ford
  - Insol dedicated his entire life to making Edison's system work
  - To make electric light usable, Insol and Edison had to invent every component of the generating and distribution system
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  But systematic as he was when pursuing his own ends, he had an almost pathological hostility to any form of sister system order or discipline imposed from without. So the mandate is clear, build a business around me, systematize that business, do not try to systemize the way I spend my time. I do not want input from others on how I'm doing that. And so I mentioned earlier, I really think of insult and a lot of the like Carnegie and Rockefeller and Ford, they're definitely company builders, but even more bigger than that, they're Industry builders. And so, insult was the same way, because remember Edison's going to give up on electricity. Insol stays with it for his entire life. He works with, well, let me just read this line to you. Says, that was to be Insol's job for nearly 12 years with Edison and 40 years thereafter to make Edison's system work. And so why do I say it's really industry building? Because listen to what they have, all the things they have to invent that you just wouldn't if you're not building an issue. The inventions, the electricity inventions could not be immediately used with existing devices. So to make his electric light usable Edison and Insol had first to invent every component of an electric generating and distribution system and then to create the manufacturing industry To make them, an engineering organization to install them and a central station industry to buy them. ([Time 0:26:53](https://share.snipd.com/snip/477db0e5-cbf9-490a-a5da-c54fbf75461f))
    - **Note:** Sam came to America and day one off the boat he’s tasked with raising money to fund electricity by selling Edison’s European patents and he works through the night to do this. Finished at 4 am. Edison was disorganized chaos and insull couldn’t give him a schedule but had to systematize the world around Edison. Insull could be dropped in any problem and figure it out so Edison would put him everywhere. It doesn’t matter how many great decision you make over your career but if you overlever yourself you can kill uourself in a second. He borrowed as a habit for all his projects he build deep relationships in the electric industry through his work with Edison. He build an industry the electric industry from the ground up. He never paid cash when you could use a note but when the depression came he thought it was temporary. What made him successful was very smart people taking on leverage but eventually he couldn’t refi his debts. He’s a bright and rich person but what made him successful leads him to the wrong place and time and leverage kills him
- The Dangers of Leverage and Taking Over Thomas Edison's Company
  Key takeaways:
  - Maturity's must be met by payment in cash
  - Dangers of too much leverage: liquor, ladies, and leverage
  - Bright and rich people often go broke because of leverage
  - Sam and soul takes over the company from Thomas Edison
  - Stock price increases from $25 to $150 in six years
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And so goes to maturity's must actually be met by payment for that only cash will do the job end of warm up and show her there. Two quotes that I always think about on the dangers of too much leverage. Charlie Munger said smart men go broke three ways liquor, ladies and leverage. Sam and soul was married to the same woman his whole life. He never drank a drop of alcohol in his entire life. He did not grow go broke because of ladies or liquor. He went broke because of leverage. Warren Buffett whenever a bright and rich person that is what Sam and soul was. He was a bright and rich person. Warren Buffett whenever a bright and rich person goes broke. It's usually because of leverage. And so this is a very important six years in Sam and soul's life because he is now essentially saying, Hey, Thomas Edison is like you, you have to run the company and Edison is he's not interested In like he's off on other things now. He got it started and then goes off and does something else. And he does it's not like he's going to give you a list of like, this is what you should do. This is what he tells him Edison says, do a big Sammy, make it either a big success or big failure. And so he takes over company. The stock is around $25 share. They have 200 employees. Six years later, the stock will be $150 to share any of 6,000 people. ([Time 0:34:52](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b1dc3c96-60a4-4fca-a6dc-a217a23f9d73))
    - **Note:** He gets put in charge of the GE daily ops with the only directive to make it big. In 6 years he grows from $25 to $150 and he never has any cash because it’s capex intensive but he’s always on the look for cash. Basic principals always expanding by reinvesting in the business and borrowing as much as possible treating his workers well so they didn’t leave and worked hard. Knew scale in electricity was vital. Spread fixed costs thinly and does this by vertically integrating and sell products as cheap as possible to drive more sales. Insull is running the $50mm ny GE company the Chicago GE company basically $1mm in size 50x smaller wants someone to run the company and be given full autonomy Insull is asked for a recommendation and recommends himself. He joins with the idea of making it bigger than NY and they laugh at him but he’s given full autonomy and his strategy is to create a monopoly to drive prices down and expand. Invents the regulated monopoly concept for utilities. He doesn’t do this by going after smaller companies but buys up his next largest competitor.
- Rockefeller's Power Grabs in Chicago 1894-1895
  Key takeaways:
  - Rockefeller quickly gained dominance in the Chicago electricity market by buying out smaller competitors.
  - Rockefeller's strategy was to buy out smaller stations and then sell them to his company for profit.
  - Rockefeller's generous offers to the smaller competitors helped maintain positive relationships and prevent them from becoming enemies.
  - Insol recognized the importance of using money to maintain relationships and avoid potential conflicts.
  - Rockefeller's tactics were criticized by those who believed the Chicago electricity market couldn't support a large player like him.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  This is going to be Rockefeller too. This policy quickly paid off caught between bad times and difficulty, even in buying replacement light bulbs, six of the small central stations in Chicago gave up in 1894. This is the clea. This is Cleveland massacre is when in like a couple of months, I think Rockville swelled up with like 17 or 25 of his competitor, smaller competitors or something. This is something it's very similar. It's happening here in Chicago in 1894 and 1895. All the six smaller stations sold out to Chicago Edison. So he knocked off two, then he knocked off. He knocked off the second biggest competitor, then he knocked off the first. Now that that company combined with those three companies, right, he's the biggest player in town. Now he's found a way to get six other smaller people to sell to him. So they sell they sell to insult when he won. In so was always generous to the losers paying them more for their plants than they were worth. Rockefeller did the same thing. This is incredible. This was not this was not him being benevolent, but good business. This is a great line. Insol recognized that while money may not buy friends, it will keep many a man from becoming an enemy and people while they're watching him do this, like this is dangerous. You shouldn't do this. This is a little boutique. You know, this is a tiny little business. What are you doing? Optimists at his time, right? They're like, okay, how many possible customers can you have in a city of Chicago? ([Time 0:46:03](https://share.snipd.com/snip/07f9abcb-57af-4de0-9623-11be666d1a5f))
    - **Note:** Insull executed his version of the Cleveland massacre by buying up light companies down on their luck paying more than their worth not out of benevolence but to avoid enemies. He was laser focused in the industry he knew best. People thought his tam was 25k but he thought it was 1mm everyone in Chicago it ends up being 1/8th of the country so the experts were off by 20x and he was off by 10x even most optimistically. He knew his industry better he had the special insight. He did this during a financial panic which teaches him bad lessons for the depression. He was a pr master and used this to push utilities through as government regulated monopolies he always believed he could refi debts like a government but eventually this wasn’t true. Framing the discussion is important he asked for 6mm bond was turned down asked for 100mm was turned down then asked for a open ended mortgages and they said yes he borrowed 500mm under this construct reframed the ask. He needed this for mass production which was a concept he invented.
- Insol's Approach to Acquiring Talent and Expanding Scale
  Key takeaways:
  - Insol described his activities as mass production before Henry Ford
  - Insol used buying companies as a way to acquire talent and avoid enemies
  - New properties were a valuable source of executives for Insol
  - Insol sold electricity at low prices to attract customers
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Insol soon began describing what he was doing as massing production as they thought as a massing production, right? A phrase that his published his sort into mass production long before historians mistakenly ascribed that term to Henry Ford, massing production turned into mass production. Another very fascinating idea. Remember, he was acquisitive by nature, right? So he's buying all these companies. And what he realized is, is like, okay, well, I'm buying them. Sometimes I'm paying more than they're worth because money is a good way to avoid people being enemies with me, right? I want people on my side. Think of a Rockefeller essentially built a company full of founders, right? He just bought their company and then he's like, Hey, you guys are talented. Come and advise me. And then you'll be rewarded with standard oil stock. Now, this is fascinating. So he says buying all these new properties is like, Oh, wait, I'm not only applying scale. I'm acquiring customers and acquire equipment. More important than that, I get talent. So he's like aqua hiring people back in the day, right? He would devise methods and he would detect talented people. And if he thought they were talented, he would partner with them or buy their entire company. And so he said new properties were the most prolific producers of executives inside of the insult organization. That sounds a lot like Rockefeller. Another Rockefeller asked things sell at the lowest price possible sell ridiculously low. And he sold solo that no one could afford not to have electricity service to win customers insult sold electricity at rates. ([Time 0:53:42](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5b225cbd-40a5-4580-846d-f47849ca948a))
    - **Note:** He would acquire businesses to hire the people who work there, aqua hiring. He also continuously drove his prices down. He sold solo that no one could not afford to have electricity, and the biggest source of his executives came from acquisition. He sold rates at so low it drove his competitors out of business. He crafted a perfect pr statement as winning the public to his side was vital but his best pr move was rate cuts customers loved him by voluntarily driving down prices. Very focused about pr his first pr idea was best service lowest price. 2. Was a well informed public educate your customers about your product like Ogilvy. He made electric abundant everywhere. Grew from 5mm to 150mm then tried to sell his stock to all his customers got too poor to be bankrupt. He lost control of his companies and bought stock in other investment organizations on margin and backed the stock of his employees margin calls taking on debt to do this. Took 200mm of debt in 1930 after the depression to keep stock up constant more debt thought he was part Devine bought into his cult of personality. He’s taking on more and more debt. Took leverage too high and complex in a collapsing market but they keep buying the dip. Eventually it just gets too much and he completely imploded he’s getting margin loans on stocks to buy more but eventually it blows up and ends.
