- Made clothes because they were great margin.
  The first ceo hired is not a business person and calls countless ceos for help. They all help you need to ask for help.

- Long term thinking Iroquois had a person who would consider the 7th generation response to something that was done Yvonne wanted to build for 100 years so he took the same long term view.
  Pick a mission for the industry not the company akkio mordida wanted Japan not Sony to be known for quality. Jeff did this with Amazon. Yvonne wanted to set the industry standard and teach others.
  Multidisciplinary learning took ideas from falconry. Yerac is the idea of keeping your falcon constantly alert and ready to attack. Putting in the work to stay sharp. Super alert hungry not weak and ready to hunt.
  Lessons - quality simplicity long term thinking bring a misfit being a pirate.
  The more you know the less you need. You dont want to give customers 100 options you just want to use your knowledge to make the best product and keep it simple.

    - **Note:** Long term mindset wanted to define the industry not be a company thinking bigger.
      You want to use your knowledge to produce by reduction not options but quality.
      Staying hungry and focused constantly cross disciplinary default aggression and constantly on alert.
- Common excuses he doesn’t believe in excuses… obviously if you call 4 times call 20 and email. If you’re not covered by an insurance provider get new insurance. If someone didn’t do something it was low priority. Nothing is impossible.
  High quality people want high quality products like the iPod or bmw. People will pay for quality.
  Teach to sell. Don’t advertise teach inform and inspire and the sales follow. Non fiction marketing their marketing plan is who they are it’s much harder to write fiction than non fiction but with non fiction you need to live up to it. Wanted to be authentic and instead of hiring models they just asked their customers for pictures and it’s free.
  Profit comes from customers telling you they want what you have. Manage the top line and the bottom line follows manage the bottom line and lose both. Quality not price determines success don’t be the biggest company be the best and choose quality. Don’t get in debt and have cash to maximize on market opportunities.
  Work and play constantly. Doing both.

      High quality products and advertising that talks about what the product does. Make great products delight customers avoid leverage work that feels like play.
      Make great products and the score takes care of itself.
- Change is opportunity change doesn’t happen without stress and is vital. Learns from many books that aren’t business books change isn’t a threat but the opportunity to grow to a higher level. Company need stress to grow and when there is none the leader catalyzes one. Adapt or die. Biggest issue he has is combatting complacency. Just because you plan for the future doesn’t mean you get there. Maintain a sense of urgency and instigate change even for a laid back company like Patagonia they need to embrace stress and change. The world is build on complacency on the great push through and define the future. Only the business on the fringe constantly evolving will survive the ones that adapt slowly and become complacent die.
  Don’t optimize for money optimize for life because you can take it with you when you go
