### Highlights

- Young people should be risk-seeking and pursue interesting opportunities. Maximize learning speed by pursuing obsessive interests. He’s a believer in mentorship. He raises money out of college to start a hedge fund and decides to go back to college if he’s not successful. Learn from older mentors. Ken had the right set of skills for the time a combination of math finance and computer science is what made him success. Right place and time. The idea of using math people to solve markets was novel but important. Invest and embrace technology. Ken had to capture this edge quickly because it was gone soon. Monetize your edge quickly because soon it’s gone. Must act before it’s lost. Then you must constantly evolve with the evolving market. You want to work with and find people who are going to push you. Find mentors who force you to prove how much you want it. Mediocrity is invisible until passion exposes it. If you’re not learning somewhere leave very quickly.

  And this is the advice that Ken is giving to these students at Yale. I tell this to everybody, you should be risk seeking at this point in your life. So keep in mind, Ken started Citadel right out of college. This is a great moment to think about pursuing opportunities that have the maximal personal interest. You should go for it right here and right now because there will come a time where it's going to be harder to take risks. Right now, you should absolutely be thinking about what the high risk opportunities that you could pursue are that you'll have the greatest experience with. And so he talks about this bunch, you know, you're going to take risks. You have no idea. There's no way you could possibly predict if you're going to be successful or not. The important thing is that you're maximizing the speed at which you're learning. And then you're following something that you're just completely ([Time 0:11:53](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5b2382fa-e0a9-48d6-a19c-d91a1afdcfdc))
- Maximize your career equity (education and skills). This equity doesn't fluctuate with the market, provides ultimate job security, and is your ticket to success. Make the most of your sweat equity. Adversity forges talent. Bad times builds resilience but good times create soft people. Being exposed to hardship early moldes character. Citadel almost went out of business in 2008. They’ve won and lost more money than almost anyone. They’ve lost 100 bn in a year. He had a 50% drawdown the only way they survived was because they studied the mistakes of others and created policies to avoid those mistakes which kept them alive. Making mistakes is a learning experience but you must actually learn from it. Dying for your country is an honor make sure you give your enemy that honor. Learn from mistakes don’t view them negatively but if you can learn from others mistakes much better.

  The most valuable equity that you'll create in your lifetime is your career equity that you own. It's really thinking about your education, your skills. It doesn't go up and down with the market. You own that equity and you want to think about how to maximize your career equity because that toolkit that you develop over your career, that's your ultimate job security. That's your ultimate ticket to success. Another piece of advice that Ken has here, really, I'm going to read this Warren Buffett quote that came to mind first because this is exactly what he's talking about. So Warren Buffett says, a rising tide floats all boats. Only when the tide goes out, do you discover who has been swimming naked?

- Ken Griffin's greatest source of stress comes from his internal expectations. He constantly pushes himself to be better. He doesn’t deal with stress he likes it. In a crisis some people get hard others are deer in headlights. You must exercise your resilience in stress to be successful take it one step at a time. When Enron went out of business Ken was on a flight that day to talk with and hire their energy team. This has since made him 40bn. Act quickly and decisively. Have the highest expectation of yourself vs others expectations of you. Making decisions under uncertainty. The environment is constantly changing your decisions can’t be too prescriptive you need to trust the process and stick with it. Don’t get too caught up in the day to day nuyt crwte a good process to live by. The world is always changing and you need to be psychologically and financially flexible to adapt to the change.

  What Ken's about to say here, I think he has a comment with a lot of history's greatest entrepreneurs, is their main sources of stress are not external. It's the pressure and expectations they put on themselves. It comes from within. He says, my biggest stressor, that's me.

- If your field doesn't inspire passion, move on. Without passion, you won't have the grit to compete with those who are passionate. The world passes you by in 5 years or instantly when you lose passion. Need to constantly keep learning and stay hungry. You need to stay at it work harder than everyone. You need to love it and commit to it. Success is illusion it’s twice what you’ve accomplished. Hedonic treadmill. Hit the ground running early in the life. Compound in your 20-30s. Compounding happens in the out years. Optimize for growth and durability. Don’t get rich quick. Greatness takes time. You need to be relentless chasing things you love and working hard constantly. Find something you’re passionate about and do it forever. Reps matter for making decisions and doing things. Ken wants to live in deep liquid markets with big tam. Everyone has to sell if you want to be successful you need to sell. Not selling is giving up. Ken flew to Switzerland to get laughed out of the room but he pushed on he didn’t let it crush him You don’t play to win you play to win by a landslide. Study the best of other people and industries and apply to his business he took his risk wall idea from Aramco.

  They lost their edge. It's really important if you're not finding yourself learning and growing as a leader and as a domain expert in your field that you pursue, you've got to move on. The other thing I would say is that if the field that you chose to pursue ultimately inspires no passion, you need to move on also. Because if you're not passionate about the field you're engaged in, you won't have the grit or perseverance to compete with those who are. And does that not repeat over and over again in these biographies that you and I go over? You could say passion. I definitely think that's a word. Another way to think about that too, which I think is very similar is Charlie Munger has this quote that he says, another thing that I found is that intense interest in any subject is indispensable If you're going to excel in ([Time 0:46:19](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5ecba772-1f8b-402c-8be9-2953b3080c87))
