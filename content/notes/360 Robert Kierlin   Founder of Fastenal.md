  Speaker 1
  His name is Will Overton. Overton started out at Fastenal as a store clerk. So we went all the way from they mean businesses, they went all the way from store clerk to CEO. And so what I'm reading from, I found this out after I finished the book, because I'm like, it's just obvious. I wonder if Buffett and Munger have ever talked about this company or the way they are, about the founder or anything like this. And it turns out when you search, it's like, oh yeah, Buffett would bring up this company in interviews. And so I just want to pull out a couple things from this interview with the CEO. So it talks about what Fastenol is. It's North America's largest wholesale and retail distributor of nuts, bolts, hand tools, and other supplies to the construction and manufacturing markets. It has built a loyal following among customers through quality and service, and won countless fans on Wall Street for its thrifty, no nonsense ways. Warren Buffett is an admirer having praised Fastenal in an interview. He loved its robust financial performance and its straightforward plan. This is their business plan. Boosting sales by adding customers and increasing its interaction with them. The unexpected shout out prompted Fasconal CEO Will Overton to trek to Omaha to have lunch with Warren Buffett. The two cost conscious bosses hit it off. We talked about the importance of sticking to the basics. And one thing they talk about is that the CEO is not afraid to get his hands dirty. ([Time 0:12:53](https://share.snipd.com/snip/af3598ba-1f60-4f8d-bcbd-50c43a850b96))
    - **Note:** CEO is a former store clerk who took over from the founder and is not worried about getting his hands dirty. Very cost-conscious, which has made them very successful key to their success is controlling their cost. CEO got a truckers license so he can help out at the stores when people were sick. Virtuous cycle, keeping Costlow means you can pay people more means you retain more talent means you make more sales create a strong flywheel. Strong incentives be implied made a 38bn business off a commodity product. The purpose of a leader is to train other leaders. Keep organization, simple, which is not simple through a common goal. Entrepreneur success is as much due to leader ship skills as work ethic at all points of the business. Structure isn’t important the people are the difference. Organizations are successful because they better involve all their people and empower them. Organizations empower people and keep things simple.
- Unity in Simplicity: The Common Pursuit
  Summary:
  Organizations thrive when all members align towards a singular common goal, yet maintaining this focus over time is challenging.
  It requires simplifying the mission and reinforcing the importance of unity, as diverging interests can lead to the rise of subgroups that pursue their own agendas, jeopardizing the overall mission. Achieving this harmony is not about complexity; rather, it's about consistently embodying and advocating for the shared purpose, making it a deceptively simple yet profound principle for sustainable success.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I really think this book and Bob's main thesis, which he calls, hey, we need to keep everybody in your organization concentrated in pursuit of that common purpose, of that common goal, Is the way Munger would summarize that for us, is that you have to keep things simple and then remember what you set out to do. And that's very difficult, especially over a long period of time, because it goes against your human nature. That's why he says it's the most elusive of human goals. And so Bob, like many of the great founders, they do a great job of distilling down to the essence, the principles upon which their business is built into maxims and aphorisms that you Can remember, you can repeat, and you can take with you. So he says, hey, keeping the organization simple isn't so simple. What's the next one? The uncommon pursuit of the common goal. I almost feel like when I'm reading this book, he's saying, hey, guys, this isn't rocket science. This is a simple idea that's not easy to do over the long term. And so what is the uncommon pursuit of the common goal? Organizations succeed to the extent that all of their members pursue a common goal. This is one of those simple ideas that are so difficult to practice. The greatest danger to the success of the organization is that it starts developing unnecessary subgroups, and these subgroups start pursuing their own goals rather than the common Goal of the organization. ([Time 0:19:21](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1683b12b-2ee7-4e93-98b2-24ae4e388618))
    - **Note:** Uncommon pursuit of a common goal it’s simple, not easy. Unity of command like napoleon. Be clear about your goals and make sure you’re pursuing them. He didn’t believe in executive parking spots or special treatment. Everyone was viewed the same from the lowest worker to the CEO. If you’re not selling or helping people sell we don’t need you. Special parking spots and stock options tell everyone else their not important which destroys companies. Keep everyone happy once the execs or leadership start valuing luxury the operation is screwed. No special treatment. The Hyundai ceo visited a work site and they laid down carpet for him he got very mad realizing this doesn’t serve the business at all. Get the incentives right. Incentives drive the world. Pays bonuses quarterly or monthly not yearly.
- Empowerment Over Central Control
  Summary:
  Effective leadership fosters growth by allowing individuals to take initiative and learn through experience, rather than simply providing solutions.
  Organizations that centralize planning stifle creativity and limit the potential of their workforce, leading to stagnation and inefficiency. In contrast, nimble startups thrive by promoting innovation and execution from all levels, highlighting the risks of hierarchical management structures that resemble small socialist states, where only a few dictate the flow of ideas and plans.
  For meaningful engagement and fulfillment, employees must be empowered to contribute, rather than marginalized as passive participants.

  Speaker 1
  The troop that I joined when I was 10 had a leader who did not challenge the kids. He arranged everything for us. So they would go on camping trips. And instead of teaching them, you know, they're obviously when you teach somebody, when you let them do something they've never done before, they're going to make mistakes. And so the troop leaders like, oh, you know, all set up the tent. I will do all the cooking. I will start the fire. They're essentially just sitting around useless. And he says, we watched other troops cooking stew, making fires, setting up TPs and rope bridges. While we sat around at the end of a few years, nobody was above the rank of second class scout in our troop. Today, I probably couldn't survive in the woods for more than a few hours." And he immediately translates that lesson to what he observed in his multi-decade career. Too many business organizations practice central planning to the extent that the creativity of their people is effectively 95% curtailed. And he rails against this because he was taught that this is better management, and he clearly does not agree with this. Businesses that become large and quote unquote better manage saw their markets and profits eaten up by nimble startup firms with great ideas and efficient execution. Many large companies resemble small socialist states. Ideas and plans all come from the top. The majority of the workers are treated differently than the top planners and most of the workers receive little or no self-fulfillment in their jobs. ([Time 0:28:46](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0a1e5846-6f00-497b-a166-5ed20eff7fd2))
    - **Note:** He didn’t believe in business central planning because it took agency from the employees and led to the collapse of the company. When he was a Boy Scout, his scout leader did everything for the troop and none of them learned anything or had successful scout careers because they never had the agency in ability to be forced to learn and think for themselves. Give people a chance to take ownership. Need to learn to delegate give people on the front lines the power. See from the front, the people who make the decisions should be the people closest to the customer because they know better than anyone what the customer wants. They allow workers to special order anything when they understand the customer will need it from talking with customers. Had very clear principles not a giant manual so people knew how to operate. He wants leaders not managers.
- Lead Like a Coach, Not a Manager
  Summary:
  Effective leadership resembles coaching more than traditional management.
  A basketball coach empowers players to make quick, autonomous decisions, while a baseball manager maintains tight control over each player's actions. This distinction underscores the need for leaders to relinquish control and encourage team members to collaboratively determine the best path to achieve their goals.
  Unlike managers who dictate tasks and oversee every detail, leaders should focus on setting clear objectives and challenging their teams to innovate and execute effectively.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And if you're a leader, it's much more like a coach than it is and he gives us baseball, he gives us sports analogy, right? And so he talks about the difference between a coach in basketball and a manager. Remember, he wants leaders, not managers, and a manager in baseball. Have you ever considered, and this will basically illustrate his entire idea around this chapter, have you ever considered the top supervisor on a baseball team is called a manager, While the top supervisor on a basketball team is called a coach? Look at the control each one has. His whole point is like you've got to get over this fear of relinquishing control. The baseball manager is controlling each move of the player, waving the shortstop over a little or signaling when the runner should steal the base or ordering the pitcher to walk a runner. In the baseball game, the manager is in complete control and fits the old style idea of a manager. What he means by old style idea of a manager is what they teach in business school, which he feels is useless. In the basketball game, the coach is relying on each player to make quick decisions about passes and shots. This is much more Bob's philosophy. The coach may send in a play after a timeout, but control swiftly passes back to the players on the court. In business, the manager controls what each person does, assigning tasks and communicating the results upward. Bob does not like that. The leader, however, tells the team members what the group has to accomplish and challenges them to find the best way to do so. ([Time 0:37:12](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0a2929e7-2be6-4d25-a2ec-9763f3002f1a))
    - **Note:** Manager versus a coach, a manager is in baseball someone constantly positioning, making every decision for the players wear basketball. A coach can drop a play, but really it’s about laying down the principles and trusting the players to execute. He wants leaders not managers and leaders are master learners who develop more master learners. Pay attention to the silent people when you were leading you must ask everyone not just 50% because then you only have half the ideas. He worked at a metal repair shop and the manager had a corner office while the assistant manager was on the floor, and everyone asked the manager questions because he was available and rose in the organization more than the manager because he was available and knew everything saw from the front. Ask 2 questions to each customers. What’s your best idea that would improve this company and what is something stupid we’re doing. Both these questions across an organization create change.
- Empowerment Fuels Future Growth
  Summary:
  Fastenal leverages its people as a core advantage, fostering a virtuous cycle that correlates with its rapid growth, doubling in size every two and a half years.
  The company's decentralized decision-making structure empowers employees to adapt to future changes, promoting proactive leadership that prioritizes long-term vision over past successes. This flexibility allows Fastenal to avoid acquiring outdated business practices and encourages innovation, positioning them to shape the future rather than be outpaced by competitors.
  A focus on future possibilities is essential to prevent stagnation and ensure sustainable growth.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  His constant repeating that Fastenal's advantage is people serves his main goal. All of his ideas work together. It's that virtuous cycle, that virtuous flywheel. There's another advantage of decentralized, this extreme decentralized decision making and that's the flexibility to respond to changes in the future. The future is not just next week or next month, but years out. Fastenaw has been growing at a rate where it doubles in size every two and a half years. That means that in five years, we are four times the size. So our people have to think that in five years, we will haul four times as much product around the country. I love this sentence. Good ideas start by simple approaches to what lies ahead. A proactive leader understands that unless one attends to the future you get locked into the past. The main reason Fastenal doesn't grow much through acquisition is that we would buy too much old baggage with acquired companies. We want our leaders to do what is best for what lies ahead rather than repeating what brought success in the past. Anytime you stop thinking about the future, some people with better ideas will come along to eat your lunch. Anytime you stop thinking about the future, some people with better ideas will come along to eat your lunch. And if you have the flexibility and the empowerment of all and the decentralized decision making and this complete autonomy that Fesenal does, sometimes you're the one that is inventing The future. ([Time 0:42:42](https://share.snipd.com/snip/88cde2bb-235c-4dfb-880e-f808c777cce1))
    - **Note:** They’re always thinking about the future when you stop thinking about the future and focus on the past or integrating acquisitions. A new company comes in and eats your lunch. Empower people listen to them and delegate you need to keep learning and growing to survive. Value everyone for their unique humanist people will outperform your expectations if you let them. Don’t fear delegating. This comes from your giant ego you must suppress your ego. To suppressor egos Treat everyone is equal stay silent at times be willing to get dirty be willing to drive trucks and answer calls and do good things anonymously. Things to avoid. Keep the team goal consistent You will have subgroups that develop that create their own goals, and you must redirect them to the organization goals. Keep reminding yourself of your ignorance and how little you know to stay humble. Everything we have learned comes from the mind of someone else. Knowledge compounds and you learn at a faster rate over time. Pride and ego must be suppressed because they get in the way of the common goal. Simplicity of each rule must overcome the thick walls of pride.
- Lead with Humility and Service
  Summary:
  Pride and ego hinder organizational commitment to shared goals.
  Successful leadership involves following ten essential rules: challenge rather than control, treat everyone equally, avoid seeking the spotlight, share rewards, listen more than speak, recognize individual uniqueness, cultivate empathy, suppress ego, allow learning, and acknowledge your limitations. These principles may be simple but their practical application is challenging due to human nature.
  However, embodying these rules fosters respect and inspires others, extending one's influence well beyond their lifetime.
  Exceptional leadership leaves a lasting legacy, like that of historical figures, and contributes to a better world.
  Leaders must strive to serve a mission greater than themselves, shaping a positive example for future generations.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And I think it's important to point out the reason he keeps talking about pride and ego is because that gets in the way of your organization's commitment to the common goal. So he's going to summarize this because he loves maxims and he makes this 10 basic rules about leadership. And he says, the simplicity of each rule must overcome the thick walls of pride that prevent its implementation. One can only dream of a world where these rules are universally practiced. And we know because human nature doesn't change, they'll never be universally practiced. And so our ability to actually learn and change our behavior will always be at odds with the larger human nature. That's why I think it's so valuable. It's not because the ideas are so hard to understand. They're so hard to apply and especially apply them over, you know, since 1967, like Fastenal has. Number one, challenge rather than control. Number two, treat everyone as your equal. Number three stay out of the spotlight. Number four share the rewards. Number five listen rather than speak. Number six see the unique humanness in all persons. Number seven develop empathy. Number eight suppress your ego. Number nine let people learn. Number 10, remember how little you know. Follow these rules and provide leadership to your world. And then what I love is he ties this all together to serve a mission that is bigger than any one person, any one company, any one industry, any lifetime. He says the example that we set in the workplace will live on after us. Your life is an example for all to imitate. What parts of it others will imitate depends on the respect they have for you. If you have earned respect through your leadership, others will imitate your actions and you will influence people beyond your generation. The exceptional leadership of a Thomas Jefferson or an Abraham Lincoln or a Martin Luther King or a Helen Keller or Alexander the Great lives on for centuries and makes the world a better Place for all of us. Become a leader at home and in your work. Make the world a better place because of what you do. ([Time 0:51:55](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a285faea-8655-44fb-a220-bb3ed0d67347))
    - **Note:** Fastenal simple rules everyone should live by in the organization to surpress ego and pride to serve a mission bigger than one company industry or even life time. become a leader at home and in your work make the world a better place from what you do
