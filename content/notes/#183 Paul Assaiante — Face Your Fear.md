  And what the lioness is do and it's the lioness is who do the hunting. The lioness is position this old lion in the middle of a field facing the bush the bush could be a mile away and the prey are between the old lion and the bush. And all the lioness is hide in the bush and when this old lady roars the prey run away from the roar to their death. And so the the concept is go at the problem go at what you perceive to be the problem and what you'll invariably find is it's a toothless old lady. When players come into my office and they do all the time with thorny issues or whatever they're wrestling with I always ask the same rhetorical question which is what's the worst that Can happen. Once you address the concept of what's the worst that can happen it's not that bad and that has been the thing that's holding us back. Once you come to grips with that you're fine I think the the bravest warriors in history with the samurai and when you ask the question what's the worst that could happen the answer would Be to die on the battlefield yet they saw that as a glorious cause.

    - **Note:** Often the anxiety of the moment is much worse than the event and we live suspended in this anxiety when we are really more afraid of the story we craft in our head than any outcome could really hurt us. You sometimes need to step back to go forward and people get held back by taking 1 step back or losing ground to in turn go 2 steps forward. Risk return. Donâ€™t communicate feedback in high emotion moments but wait to do so. Success is everything that leads up to a moment and the moment. Practice like a game so the game is easier. Practice your weaknesses play to your strengths. Donâ€™t procrastinate get up every day a push the ball a little further. Have a clear purpose is vital. Do what you donâ€™t want to do first write it down and then embrace the suck. Break down and chunk goals so youâ€™re making progress every day.

  No it's scary. Get away from that person. So I want I'm going to give you two Oreo cookies. Put one down. I want you to take that Oreo cookie and stand it on its edge. All right now you're looking at that Oreo cookie. This wafer represents thoughts. In the course of the day we have thousands and thousands of thoughts. Many of them are not very good. And then the other wafer is action. So you have thought and action. So here we've got these thoughts going on and then we act. What is the cream in the middle? The cream in the middle is time. There is a period of time measurable between thought and action. Okay now I want you to take the wafer off of one cookie and the wafer off of the other cookie. And I want you to put the two Oreos together with the cream. What have we just done? We've just doubled the amount of time between thought and action. That's a good thing. All right because now we're less likely to act on a thought that may have been a bad thought or a knee jerk reaction. The goal is to increase the gap of time between those two. How many of ([TimeÂ 0:30:42](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1fe24503-66c0-40cd-83c5-49b1a634a74f))
    - **Note:** Increase the time between thought and action. You need to point things out in the moment but true learning happens when you address things away from the outcome and emotions. Make in game adjustments. It never goes as you plan you need to adjust on the fly and you canâ€™t do that overcome with emotion. We grow through hardship and need to learn resilience you need to face adversity itâ€™s ok to fail. Long short term incentive misalignment fail now or dread failure later. Celebrate and be present in failure. Messaging and timing of the message is vital. Taking ownership is gong away but ownership has never been more important. Take extreme ownership. The best relationships come out of the hardest times.
