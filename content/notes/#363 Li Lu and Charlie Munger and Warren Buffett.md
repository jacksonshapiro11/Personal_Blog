  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  For our fourth meeting, I arrived an hour early and began to sit there waiting at 6.30am. And at 6.45am, Charlie leisurely walked in with a pile of newspapers and sat down, not even looking up, completely unaware of my existence. Afterward, I came to understand that Charlie will always be early for meetings. But he doesn't waste time either. He will take out the newspaper and read. One year, Charlie and I were attending an out-of meeting. After the event, I unexpectedly met Charlie at the airport terminal. His plane had already departed, but Charlie was not in a hurry. He took out a book and sat down to read while he waited for the next plane. "'As long as I have a book in my hand, I don't feel like I'm wasting time,' Charlie said. He always carries a book on him. As long as he has that book, he'll have no complaint." Charlie spent his lifetime studying the causes of human failures, so he has a profound understanding of the weaknesses of human Nature. Because of this, he believes people must be strict and demanding on themselves, continuously improving their discipline in life in order to overcome the innate weaknesses of human Nature. This way of life to Charlie is a moral requirement. He is such a unique person. ([Time 0:10:05](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c4d73b2a-3491-4ef4-a88e-cd7c3f32c265))
    - **Note:** Charlie studies when things go wrong tries to invert and avoid failure not pursue success. He’s absent minded but always feels like when he has a book and is learning he isn’t waosting time. If he can learn it’s ok and his life falls in between the cracks. People must be strict and demanding on themselves to overcome the weaknesses of human nature. He’s a business man and moral philosopher. Value system is one of self cultivation and development in the spirit of helping others. One conversation or person can change your life. There is no benefit to self pity. See yourself as an owner of a business hold forever. You need to find out who you are and invest for that temperament. The value is in the long term but if you have an investing or life style that isn’t yours you will fail. Understand who you are and be that. Being a value investor requires you to be rational and ignore being different or wrong for a long period of time. He’s naturally curious and wanted to be an investigative journalist not a day trader. All your reading will only lead to a handful of insights and you need to bet big on these.
- Devotion to Knowledge Distinguishes the Committed
  Summary:
  Trust in management and the purpose of opportunities is critical when investing.
  True investors focus on understanding businesses deeply rather than merely discussing asset ownership. Utilizing comprehensive resources, such as the Value Line Investment Survey, lays the foundation for analytical skills.
  The journey to an encyclopedic knowledge demands persistence; reading entire texts is essential for mastery.
  The willingness to engage deeply in one's education sets apart the dedicated from the indifferent, as the vast majority will not invest the effort to thoroughly understand complex material.

  Speaker 1
  Is the management somebody that I can trust? And why is this opportunity presented to me? And so the first thing that he tells the students is like, listen, I no longer talk about what we own. In other words, bad boys move in silence, but I can pick a couple examples of something that I owned in the past. And he's using this as an illustration, or I guess an example of how he thought about how he thinks about investing. And so during this he's holding this giant book. So value it's the value line investment survey, which is a stock analysis, tracks approximately, you know, 1700 something like publicly traded stocks is giant book. And he's trying to walk the students through on how to analyze businesses that are in this book. And so again, Lee Liu, just like Churchill, just like most the people you and I studied, they devour entire shell. So he's like, I got hooked on value line. And I would read the entire thing from beginning to end. He says that's really the best kind of education. If you want to have an encyclopedic knowledge base, you have to go through page after page after page. Doing so is just enormously helpful. And if you really think about the idea behind the idea, like what is he trying to tell the students? He's like, how bad do you want it? That right there, the amount of people are going to read cover to cover this giant book that it's in the video. It looks like you can work out with the thing. How many people willing to do that? Right there, it's gonna eliminate like 95 or greater than 95% of people. ([Time 0:25:43](https://share.snipd.com/snip/92d8d362-93ea-4f39-bc51-7010753ddb13))
    - **Note:** When you want to have an encyclopedic knowledge base you actually most put in the work and read encyclopedias. He had 509 books on his shelf in college and this built the base so when he would read something new he’d already know how to look at it through the mental models he built. Effort and hard work over a long period of time. When he went to invest in timberland they were subject to a lawsuit and he read every page of every legal doc. Intense effort and seeing from the front. He then visits the church the ceo goes to to understand him and gets himself invited on the same board as the CEOs son. He does this deep work and realizes the family is great and he has a massive margin of safety and bet a shitload on it. You just need to put in a crazy amount of effort and be a learning machine. Opertuniries are rare bet big when you have an edge. His first stock meeting had 3 people it then went up 7x then the room was filled there wasn’t room for more analysts it was packed he saw there was no value and sold. Leaving when the edge is gone. Really non consensus.

  And so it's clear from his description when he's talking about this section, he's like, oh, I don't care what you're calling it. I don't care what you're describing it like what you describe is like, what does it actually do? How does it actually function? And so after like struggling through this and kind of you know, criticizing them or just you know, chastising, I guess for a lack of effort is the way I would put this, he makes a point again, This type of approach is not natural. However, if you come to the conclusion that your personality somehow will fit this mutated gene pool, this is something you might really be looking to do. The only thing I can add to this is that there's a lot of money in it, as has been repeatedly proved by people from Ben Graham to Buffett and everybody else. I took this class and it really changed me fundamentally. But one thing you have to do is you've got to do it. That's why I was somewhat disappointed with the amount of work that you've put into this. I made hundreds of thousands of dollars just taking this class, just listening to the 14 or 15 people. But I did. And I'm. I'm telling you, you can make a lot of money if you're really into this. Not only just listen, but do it. I benefited hugely, hugely just by listening and actually doing it. That is the difference. There is no bullshit theory. All everybody's telling you is what works. It's what works. You guys have a terrific opportunity. And if you don't really use this, then shame on you. You've got to do it. You've got to use it. You've got to do it. I mean, you're young, you have energy.

    - **Note:** You need to use the opportunity you’re given use your gifts and position there is nothing to lose. Don’t be lazy there is no point in laziness and it leads to failure. His mantra is to provide accurate and complete information. You build it through intensity curiosity and continuous study. You may only find 10 investments that change your life. Pumchcard investing. Li lus biggest regret was when he had a business he loved and didn’t bet big missed a 50x he did the work but was scared. Make decisions with opportunity cost. Their biggest ideas they continued to double down. You need to be obsessed and you can only do that when you’re doing something authentic to you. He isn’t a sector investor but wants to to have amazing moats and sustained competitive advantages you understand. Businesses change and change creates opportunities so you must keep learning and stay vigilant
- Mastery Through Continuous Learning
  Summary:
  Success in entrepreneurship and investing hinges on a profound commitment to continuous learning.
  One must cultivate an intense interest to excel, as finding an edge requires a proper mindset and years of dedicated study. Notable figures like Warren Buffett emphasize that even a handful of good investments can lead to extraordinary wealth, illustrating the potential rewards of this journey.
  Key to this process is understanding the importance of both depth and pace in learning—observing and comprehending various companies and their management styles over time is critical.
  The example of Sam Walton reveals that his extensive experience and knowledge in retail came from relentless study and observation, affirming that mastery is built slowly yet leads to substantial success.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I could force myself to be fairly good at a lot of things, but I couldn't excel in anything, which I didn't have an intense interest. Going back to Lee Liu, the game of investing is really continuous learning. I cross that out. I really think the better way to say that is the game of entrepreneurship is really continuous learning and excessively profitable because finding an edge really only comes from a Right frame of mind in years of continuous study. This is really difficult, but on the other hand, the rewards are huge. Warren says if you only come up with 10 good investments in your 40-year career, you will be extraordinary rich. That's really what it is. This idea of finding an edge comes from years of continuous study. So one of the craziest things that kind of smack me in the face is when I read that other biography of Sam Walton. So I think I've ran Sam Walton's autobiography twice, and then I read this biography by Vance Trimble on him twice. So I think my fourth reading really smacked me in the face of the importance of like fast and then slow and then really fast. So he's talking about studying companies, reading about them, figuring out the management, figuring out the opportunity. It's like you need years of continuous study. For a founder, that can use a continuous study, it's obviously going to happen inside and outside of your business. So like Sam Walton had seen more retail stores than anybody else on the planet. And the edge came from, he was relatively slow, right? Think about this. Sam Walton, greatest retailer ever lived. ([Time 0:57:12](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ecf97ae9-d937-4359-9f40-35df2a3fe028))
    - **Note:** Continuous learning and finding your niche. He failed at investment banking and lost 19% his first year as a fund manager playing someone else’s game. You must create your own world and play your game. Faster you learn you constantly compound your knowledge. You need insight and temperament. One in a generation crises happen every few years you must weather them. He tells people to research one company learn as much as possible on it. Everything is constantly changing. Understand a business inside out than industry. Superior businesses lead to a lot of really good surprises. It took him 10 years and he’s still learning he only answers questions and thinks within his circle of competence. There are no shortcuts you just need to do the work. General business advice is useless do what is unique to you. Don’t gamble do what works for you. Look at all investments through opportunity cost which leads you to concentrate. Not be too prideful and do the deep work not to gamble. When you love it you’ll need to do it all the time. It’ll just be easy and natural. Be a learning machine deeply focus on a few things. Everything changes. The world is change.
- Embrace the Journey: Growth Through Self-Reflection
  Summary:
  Life is a complex journey influenced by numerous connections and experiences.
  Success largely stems from persistence and the ability to remain engaged, even when unsure of the path ahead. Emotional challenges like envy and resentment are counterproductive; awareness and correction of these vulnerabilities can lead to a more fulfilling life.
  Regular self-examination is crucial for personal growth, as is the willingness to change and adapt over the years.
  Finding one's true purpose involves recognizing strengths and aligning career choices with personal passions and values.
  Building relationships with mentors is invaluable, and maintaining connections with diverse age groups keeps perspectives fresh. Ultimately, growing wiser with age while nurturing a youthful spirit is a key to a rich life experience.

  And then the final thing is he turns, when he turns 50 years old, he writes this post about reflections on turning 50. And I think this is a perfect place to end. I could never imagine my life would turn out this way. It takes countless bridges, roads, means of transportation, and years of effort to travel this far. The countless people in my life, kindhearted strangers, well-wishers, mentors, partners, friends, are my bridges, my roads, my transportation for getting here. Without your help, friendship, and constant encouragement, I simply could not travel this far. If I have anything to do with that journey, it's simply that I took it. Woody Allen is right. 90% of success is to show up. At various stages of my life, I could have stopped or took the long rest, but for some reason my heart told me otherwise. I just kept going. Half of the time I wasn't sure where I was heading. The other half I was probably taking the wrong turns. No matter. But I was on high alert to correct mistakes along the way. I was careful not to be influenced by emotions that I know are poisonous and counterproductive to the journey. Things like envy, resentment, hatred, jealousy, greed, and self-pity. Again, that's very much Munger and Buffett-esque. Munger says self-pity has no utility. Buffett says that the world doesn't run on greed, it runs on envy. They both said that you need to cure yourself of envy. My early life experiences may require me to work even harder than others to guard against these human vulnerabilities. And when I did fall to their prey, I was fortunate to be able to correct them quickly. Socrates was right. The unexamined life is not worth living. Certainly not living well. Every once in a while, I would sit down alone to figure out where I might be wrong. In my experience, every 5 to 10 years or so, I had to change so much about myself that at times, it felt like almost a reinvention. And when I fail in self-examination, I'm even more blessed to have some strong friends who could point out my blind spots. I would have been lost in life's various mazes if I had not gotten that help. So through the tumblings and the zigzags, I kept going while at the time insisting on sitting in the driver's seat. It is my life and my journey after all. According to Confucius, at 50, one should know his purpose in life. What your life was meant to be. I believe in Confucius's dictate. Having done relatively well in editions of my life, I'm slowly learning the art of subtraction and focus. I would have failed in a lot of professions. For example, I wouldn't be good at ballet or basketball, but my temperament and experiences prepared me well for a career in investment. I have to pause there. I really do think one of the main themes that reappears in the teachings of Li Lu is you pick a career that you have an immense passion and that suits your personality and how you want to Spend your time. I was extremely lucky to be introduced into the field by the greatest investor who ever lived when I accidentally stepped into a lecture by Warren Buffett at Columbia nearly 25 years Ago. And it was even more magical 13 years ago when Charlie Munger became my investment partner, mentor, and lifelong friend. To this day, I don't know to what I would attribute this extreme fortune. It is something even the wildest imagination or the best fiction could not conjure. Now that I've compiled a record of my own for over 20 years, I still enjoy the game even better than when I started. I have three lovely children. They're beautiful, talented, and kind-hearted. I'm most proud of them. Reaching 50 probably makes me closer to the end than to the beginning. Regarding my age, my favorite quote comes from Norman Lear. At 94 years old, he's still active in so many different things, collecting fans who were in their 80s, their 60s, and all the way down to their 20s. I once asked him how old does he think of himself? Without missing a beat, he said, I'm always the same age as the people I talk to. Now that is a cool answer. Now that I've officially crossed the halftime line, I really need to make more young friends as my new teachers so that I can stay fresh. So my friends, may we all grow wiser with age and younger at heart, always. ([Time 1:19:35](https://share.snipd.com/snip/888dd51c-db54-4212-a2bc-74863a01d257))
    - **Note:** Life is showing up changing and having the right mentors and friends. Being yourself.
