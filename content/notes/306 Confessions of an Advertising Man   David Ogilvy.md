  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  It may be this, more than anything else which differentiates us from our competitors. Through maddening repetition, some of my maxims have been woven into our culture. Here are some of them. Number one, we sell or else. Number two, you cannot bore people into buying your product. You can only interest them in buying it. Number three, we prefer the discipline of knowledge to the anarchy of ignorance. We pursue knowledge the way a pig pursues truffles. A blind pig can sometimes find truffles, but it helps to know that they grow in oak forests. Number four, we hire gentlemen with brains. That's one of my favorite ones. Number five, the consumer is not a moron. She is your wife. Don't insult her intelligence. Number six, unless your campaign contains a big idea, it will pass like a ship in the night. I doubt if more than one campaign in a hundred contains a big idea. I'm supposed to be one of the most fertile inventors of big ideas, but in my long career, I have not had more than 20. Number seven, only first class business and that in a first class way. Number eight, never run an advertisement you would not want your own family to see. And number nine is Ogruvy's reaffirmation of his belief in the individual capacity for greatness. Search all the parks in your cities. You'll find no statues of committees. That was an excerpt from the book I'm going to talk to you about today, which is Confessions of an Advertising Man, and it was written by David Ogruvy. Ogruvy has become one of my personal heroes, somebody I did not know even existed before I started a founder's podcast. It's been over almost over two years now, almost two years since I've lasted on an episode on them. This will be the fifth podcast that I've made about them. And I just think it's been way too long since I spent some time in the mind of David Ogruvy, so that's why I'm reading this book right now. I want to finish out the introduction before I go into a little bit about his early life, because he's just got a bunch of great ideas. That's really what I think this podcast will be. It's just a bunch of fantastic ideas that Ogruvy learned over his multiple decade career. ([Time 0:05:13](https://share.snipd.com/snip/47675add-3117-4fcb-b13b-02cd81734b00))
    - **Note:** Very intentional on the culture. First class business first class way believing in a players as they don’t build statues of committees. He’s only had 20 big ideas in his life. Understand the customer and their problems well. Discipline of knowledge knowing where to hunt
- Why clients should focus on results instead of haggling over agency compensation
  Summary:
  No manufacturer ever got rich by underpaying his agency. Clients who haggle over their agency's compensation are looking through the wrong end of the telescope. Ogruvy is a master at condensing these ideas down so that you actually stick in your brain.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Clients who haggle over their agency's compensation are looking through the wrong end of the telescope. Instead of trying to shave a few measly cents off the agency's 15%, they should concentrate on getting more sales results from their 85% that they spend on time and space. That is where the leverage is. No manufacturer ever got rich by underpaying his agency. Pay peanuts and you get monkeys. That right there is an example of why spending time reading Ogruvy. I think he's the best writer that I've ever read for anybody out of any of the books that I've read for the podcast, because he's a master at language and just getting, condensing these ideas down so that you actually stick in your brain. You can read that entire paragraph, or you can just read the last sentence, pay peanuts and you get monkeys and you understand what he's saying. He repeats these aphorisms and maxims over and over and over again. And it's just a way to express these ideas that he deeply, deeply believes in. One idea that he deeply, deeply believes in is that you should study the experience and the great work that came before you. And if you don't, you're an ignorant amateur, which I love. He says advertising agencies still waste their clients money repeating the same mistakes. During a 10-hour train ride, I read the ads in three magazines. Most of them violated elementary principles, which were discovered in years gone by. The copywriters and art directors who created them are ignorant amateurs. ([Time 0:07:21](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2942e86b-10fe-4602-a682-fc135aa71c58))
    - **Note:** Pay peanuts get monkeys and learn from the best of those who came before you
- Similarities in ideas from Ogilvy's book and James Dyson's autobiography
  Summary:
  Ogilvy says editors of magazines are better communicators than advertising people. Good campaigns can run for many years without losing their selling power, Ogilvy writes. "A consumer can barely handle one great new idea, let alone two or even several," he adds.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Something I realized in rereading this book right after I read James Dyson's autobiography for the third or fourth time is a lot of their ideas are the same. James says that one editorial, one great editorial is worth a thousand advertisements. Ogilvy says editors of magazines are better communicators than advertising people. Copy their techniques. This is also another idea that Dyson repeats in his book that Ogilvy repeats in this one. Most campaigns are too complicated. They reflect a long list of objectives and try to reconcile the diversion views of too many executives. By attempting to cover too many things, they achieve nothing. Their advertisements look like the minutes of a committee. In Dyson's autobiography, which I just covered again on episode 300, he says you simply cannot mix your messages when selling something new. A consumer can barely handle one great new idea, let alone two or even several. And then the last ideas from this section is good campaigns can run for many years without losing their selling power. My eye patch campaign for Hathaway shirts ran for 21 years. My campaign for Dove soap has been running for 31 years and it is now a best seller. So the first time I read this book was over four years ago and in my mind, the reason I picked it up I was like, okay, I want more, I want like an autobiography of Ogilvy. And that's how I remember the book in my mind and realized that the autobiographical section of the book is like three pages and most of it is just straight idea after idea after idea. ([Time 0:10:37](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5bcd716c-7f2a-4858-8cb1-9073c3c2b653))
    - **Note:** Keep your message simple you want the consumer to understand clearly the value prop and not confuse it with a litany of promises. Clear and consice messaging.
- Lessons Learned in Advertising from Working Under a Master Chef
  Summary:
  "I had expected to become prime minister when I grew up. Instead, I finally became an advertising agent on Madison Avenue," he says. "By writing this book in the old fashioned first person singular, I have committed an offense against a convention of contemporary American manners." The revenues of my 19 clients are now greater than the revenue of her magices government", David writes.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Gallup in research for the motion picture industry, and an assistant to Sir William Stevenson. I think this was the guy that was the one of the inspirations for the character James Bond, an assistant to Sir William Stevenson in the British Security Coordination Department and a farmer with the Amish in Pennsylvania. And then he goes into the fact that that's not what he expected when he was growing up. I had expected to become prime minister when I grew up. Instead, I finally became an advertising agent on Madison Avenue. The revenues of my 19 clients are now greater than the revenue of her magices government. My father used to save a product that it was very well spoken of in the advertisements. I spend my life speaking well of products in advertisements. By writing this book in the old fashioned first person singular, I have committed an offense against a convention of contemporary American manners. But I think it's artificial to write we when I'm confessing my sins and describing my adventures. And then for the rest of the book, it's just David giving us ideas that he learned through the experience of his multiple decade career. This is one of my favorite parts of the entire book. It's the fact these are lessons that David learned working under a master chef. And he realizes like, Oh, these lessons can be applied to any field. ([Time 0:13:24](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9f12d0a4-d7ab-4f8c-b964-5a4f19e8ea83))
    - **Note:** Ogilvy got kicked out of Oxford and spent 17 years looking for his life’s work. He worked in film restaurants secret service as a farmer with the Amish. It can take awhile to find your passion and purpose. He was always very smart. Ogilvy learned from the French chef you need to set the bar high and inspire a players to push forward to greatness. He did not tolerate incompetence. B players ruin an organization. He didn’t want to be the biggest only the best. Provide an environment for creative marvericks and work hard because then you’re more efficient.
- Lessons on work ethic, intellect, and politics from a business leader
  Summary:
  I admire people who work hard, who bite the bullet. I dislike passengers who don't pull their weight in the boat. It is more fun to be overworked than to be underworked. The harder you work, the fewer employees we need and the more profit we make. Number three, I have an inviolable rule against employing knee-pots and spouses because they breed politics. But brains are not enough unless they are combined with intellectual honesty.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  But what I thought was so interesting too is after, after he tells his team what he expects of them, he tells his team what he expects of himself. So it says, I admire this is another great thing about his writing. You remember it. It's very easy to read and because he loves these numbered lists. Number one, I admire people who work hard, who bite the bullet. I dislike passengers who don't pull their weight in the boat. It is more fun to be overworked than to be underworked. There is an economic factor built into hard work. The harder you work, the fewer employees we need and the more profit we make. The more profit we make, the more money becomes available for all of us. Number two, I admire people with first class brains because you cannot run a great advertising agency or a great company without brainy people. But brains are not enough unless they are combined with intellectual honesty. Number three, I have an inviolable rule against employing knee-pots and spouses because they breed politics. ([Time 0:19:20](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1c98a206-8aa9-4194-9050-b147273c96e2))
    - **Note:** Hard work first class brains intellectual honesty. Work with gusto enjoy what you do when you’re alive because you’re a long time dead. People who suck up usually bully those under them. Self confident professionals who are excellent craftsman. People who are willing to hire people who can replace them not make them feel good. Build up subordinates and grow them. Well organized people who do work on time and work with good people. Master communicator. Excellence over size. Find people who are great. Tolerate genius. Talent is found in non conformists dessenters and rebels individual brilliance over committees. Teamwork is a made up term by mediocre man. Become a formidable individual.
- The Importance of Individual Greatness and Unconventional Thinking
  Summary:
  Like Edwin Land, like Steve Jobs, he believes in the capacity for individual greatness. He hates teamwork, costs teamwork. Teamwork is just like this made up turn by mediocre men. The majority of businessmen are incapable of original thinking because they are unable to escape from the tyranny of reason. Their imaginations are blocked. I have developed techniques for keeping open the telephone line to my unconscious. In case that disorderly repository has anything to tell me.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  He, like Edwin Land, like Steve Jobs, like a bunch of the people you and I study on the podcast, he believes in the capacity for individual greatness. He hates teamwork, costs teamwork. I think there's a line later on the book. Teamwork is just like this made up turn by mediocre men. So this is very, I'll get there in one second. I just love this guy. It is very fascinating because I think this is, you know, you hear me talk over and over again. The importance of building ourselves into formidable people. And I'm pretty sure like becoming a formidable individual. I've repeated over and over again for over the last couple years and I'm pretty sure that idea came from old movie in this book. I think that might be the first time I've ever heard that and something that just stuck in my mind. But before I get there, he has this great idea where I do think like you have. The benefit of being incapable of logical thought. This is going to sound crazy, but listen to what he says here. The majority of businessmen are incapable of original thinking because they are unable to escape from the tyranny of reason. Their imaginations are blocked. I am almost incapable of logical thought, but I have developed techniques for keeping open the telephone line to my unconscious. In case that disorderly repository has anything to tell me. I listen to a great deal of music. I take long, hot baths. I garden. I go into retreat among the Amish. He's not kidding about that, by the way. I watch birds. ([Time 0:25:59](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6281ce65-ff11-42fb-bb80-aedd07cd9d92))
    - **Note:** People are incapable of logical thought doing so much all the time they never think about what they’re doing. Ogilvy always makes time to turn off and let his subconscious think. Let your brain lie fallow give it a rest. Telegrams for the unconscious you need hard work an open mind and curiosity. You need to be lead by formidable individuals
- The Story of Olga V and Mather's Client Acquisition Strategy
  Summary:
  In 1948, Olga V. Mather started a new advertising agency on a shoestring. He solicited advertisers who did not employ an agency at all. The very next day he made a list of the five clients that he wanted the most. All five of them are now clients of Olga V and Mather.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  On the day in 1948, when I hung out my shingle, I issued this following order of the day. So now this is all going to be writing. He says this is a new agency, struggling for its life. For some time, we shall be overworked and underpaid. In hiring, the emphasis will be on youth. We are looking for young Turks. I have no use for toadies or hacks. I seek gentlemen with brains. And what's remarkable is how much he wrote this out in advance and he wanted it becoming true. Agencies are as big as they deserve to be. We are starting this one on a shoestring. But we are going to make it a great agency before 1960, what he did. And also the very next day, he made a list of the five clients that he wanted the most. And so some of these are like Campbell Shoop company. Remember this is more than half a century ago. Shell, all these other companies. This is the crazy thing. He has this footnote here. He says to pick such blue chip targets was an act of mad presumption. But all five of them are now clients of Olga V and Mather. And so when he has no money and no one knows who he is, all of his client acquisition has to be outbound. So he says, okay, well, what's the smartest play here? And he comes and he does something that's really smart. He's like, okay, well, if you're an existing company, you already have an advertising agency, maybe you like them. What's the chance I'm going to be able to go in there and convince you to go with me? I have no proven record. So this is what he did. Following Henry Ford's advice to his dealers that they should solicit by personal visitation, I started by soliciting advertisers who did not employ an agency at all. He also does something that I thought was genius because this is genius at first time. I read this book and I still think it's genius. He does this like highly targeted direct mail campaign, but it's not just, hey, I'm Olga V and I can do your advertising. He doesn't even do that at all. He sends useful and valuable information that pertains to them. Let me tell you what I mean. I sent frequent progress reports to 600 people in every walk of life. ([Time 0:29:42](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5ae89bff-a5d0-48c8-9b23-c5f98a5c4142))
    - **Note:** Ogilvys original job post said you would be overworked and underpaid but he was looking for men with brains. He set out his dream clients on day 1 aiming for the blue chip of the blue chip. He did reserve inquiry sending his clients he wanted to recruit a ton of mail and this set beginning of the relationship and who he was. He didn’t have time to wait in client acquisition he was in a hurry.
- The Importance of Persistence in the Hunt for New Business
  Summary:
  "I left a message at his hotel saying that I wanted to see him. For ten days, there was no reply," he said. "When my telephone rang and he reported that Mr. Burns wanted me to lunch with him on the following day...that's what you need in the hunt for new business."
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  What do you think Obi-B's about to do? What would most people do? They're like, oh, wait, two weeks back.
  Speaker 1
  No, wrong answer. The next morning I learned that he had gone to England. So I flew to London, and left a message at his hotel saying that I wanted to see him. For ten days, there was no reply, and I had almost given up hope. When my telephone rang and he reported that Mr. Burns wanted me to lunch with him on the following day. Now this is just a good, this is also, he said, midnight, luck in midnight oil, right? That's what you need in the hunt for new business. So imagine trying to chase down the president of Shell to prove to him how bad you wanted his account, right? Doesn't hear from him for ten days. The day he says, oh, come to lunch with me tomorrow.
  Speaker 2
  Og Bee- was going to be lunging with the Secretary of the State of Scotland, right? ([Time 0:33:37](https://share.snipd.com/snip/943ae906-eabe-4a53-a358-d09919166c7d))
    - **Note:** Ogilvy got a chance to win the shell account spent all night answering his pitch being very candid sent it in in the morning realized the ceo had flown to London so he flew to London that day to close the deal. After 10 days the ceo offered to have lunch. He was having lunch of the Secretary of State of Scotland and invited the ceo giving him the answers face to face. He won the contract. When you set high standards and differentiate yourself you create less competition because you rise above the average. Set high standards and give clear feedback on where you can improve. Ogilvy didn’t want to sell the company but lead it to greatness he didn’t want to work for others. Live life in a hurry do not delay and tolerate and foster genius.
- Learning from the Greats: Ogilvy and Napoleon on Building a Successful Campaign
  Summary:
  Gloria Borger: Ogilvy had a lot in common with Napoleon. She says the most important job is to decide what you are going to say about your product. "I am an in-veterate brain picker, and the most rewarding brains I've picked are my predecessors"
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So then he goes into how to build a great advertising campaign. And we're going to see that he had a lot in common with Napoleon. If you heard the recent episode I did on Napoleon, episode 302, it's called the mind of Napoleon. It's just literally Napoleon speaking directly to you. He's constantly referencing. This is what Alexander did. This is what Julie Caesar did. Ogilvy is the same thing. I am an in-veterate brain picker. And the most rewarding brains I've picked are the brains of my predecessors and of my competitors. I have learned much from studying the successful campaigns. Napoleon would repeat that over and over again. He did it for himself. When he's close to death, he's like, this is what I want my son to do. This is the curriculum and education I have my son. It's like study the great work that came before you. So Ogilvy says, your most important job is to decide what you are going to say about your product, what benefit you are going to promise in Ogilvy and advertising, which I have not read probably in three or four years maybe, but I've read the highlights over and over again. He says in Ogilvy and advertising, that is the most important sentence in the book. And he tells you to read it again, that you have to figure out the most important thing you do, the most important thing to decide is what benefit you are going to promise. Another one of his maximuses, the more you tell, the more you sell. Give facts. Very few advertisements contain enough factual information to sell the product. Study the copy in Sears's catalog. It sells a billion dollars worth of merchandise every year by giving the facts. In my Rolls Royce advertisements, I gave nothing but facts. ([Time 0:41:16](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ba733cab-305e-4532-a5ac-5e1601eb5d50))
    - **Note:** Figure out your core promise to consumers and repeat that constantly. Only give facts about products no adjectives. The more information you give the more you sell. Collect facts but don’t bore people. You don’t need to advertise to a standing army but a moving parade. Stick with what works and don’t get away from a successful ad just because it’s old. It’s easy to value novelty but hard to stick with what works even when it’s the best thing to do. The headline is the most important piece. It’s 80% of your dollars because if it’s not good people ignore you. Include your promise in your headline and make it longer rather than shorter. Give testimonials make what you’re selling clear keep the pitch consice and repeat ad nausea. His best piece of copy was found on page 50 of a rolles Royce manual. Willing to do the work to dig up the important facts.
- On Writing Effective Paragraphs and the Importance of Repetition and Ambition
  Summary:
  A long first paragraph frightens readers away. All your paragraphs should be as short as possible. Repeats it again in advertising. Add nauseam throughout. After watching the careermanship of my own employees for 14 years, I have identified a pattern of behavior which leads rapidly to the top. First, you must be ambitious. And we're going to see Ogilvy echoing that very sage advice.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  A long first paragraph frightens readers away. All your paragraphs should be as short as possible. Long paragraphs are fatiguing. And a perfect description of that is the book itself. It's full of short, easy to read memorable paragraphs. Early in the book, he talked about the importance of repetition in building your company culture. Repeats it again in advertising. The average consumer is subjected to over 10,000 advertisements a year. Make sure that she knows the name of the product being advertised in your commercial. Repeat it. Add nauseam throughout. He repeats the same idea so much. He says that his sister suggested that the name of his ad agency should be changed to add nauseam incorporated. And then he gives a lot of advice on how to rise to the top. I've told you before that I think the best talk available on YouTube for any founder is this presentation that Bill Gurley gave a couple years ago. I think it was at the University of Texas MBA students. It's called running down a dream, how to succeed and thrive in your career you love. And one of my favorite lines from that talk was that Bill said that you have zero excuse for not being the most knowledgeable person in any subject that you want because this information is right there at your fingertips. And we're going to see Ogilvy echoing that very sage advice. After watching the careermanship of my own employees for 14 years, I have identified a pattern of behavior which leads rapidly to the top. First, you must be ambitious. ([Time 0:46:56](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d42f15ca-a5b0-4023-a75b-6b3fe71ee724))
    - **Note:** Running down a dream you must be the most informed on your subject matter area. You most be ambitious. If you’re advertising for gasoline read textbooks trade journals and copy from your agency and after 2 years you’ll be able to know more than your boss. Most people are lazy and don’t do this. Conspiracy of the mediocre majority. One of his best workers when there was a request for info on the tv industry and when others turned in 10 pages turned in 177 after working day and night for 3 weeks.
