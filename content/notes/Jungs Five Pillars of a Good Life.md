### Highlights

- 1. Do not fall prey to seeking pure happiness. Instead, seek lifelong progress toward *happierness*. 
  2. Manage as best you can the main sources of misery in your life by attending to your physical and mental health, maintaining employment, and ensuring an adequate income. 
  3. If you’re earning enough to take care of your principal needs, remember that happiness at work comes not from chasing higher income but from pursuing a sense of accomplishment and service to others. 
  4. Cultivate deep relationships through marriage, family, and real friendships. Remember that happiness is love. 
  5. If you have discretionary income left over, use it to invest in your relationships with family and friends. 
  6. Spend time in nature, surround yourself with beauty that uplifts you, and consume the art and music that nourish your spirit. 
  7. Find a path of transcendence—one that explains the big picture in life and helps you comprehend suffering and the purpose of your existence. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw1qa37cr4jpvpf8hpytabj0))
