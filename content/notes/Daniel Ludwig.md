  Lone wolf who prefers to work alone.
  He was constantly learning from different experiences which he was able to apply to his career.
  It’s not what you do but how you do it. Constantly asking if he can do the same work for more money.
  Constantly looking for better deals and trading up. If someone offered him a good deal for his company he would sell it. Like a trader. Always looking for better things. Always looking for opportunity. Finds old rich guys with money and he’s a young guy with energy.

It’s not what you do, but how you do it. Deep commitment to the craft.
- He bought war ships from the government very cheaply because the war had ended. You only needed to put up 10% of the purchase price do he got free leverage but when the depression hit he couldn’t make his interest payments and at 37 was almost wiped out. 10 years later he would become the richest man in the world. His owns the asset but has low demand when the war starts demand jumps up and this jumpstarts his life.
  He’s now 40 shipping oil for Rockefeller. His 2 paper system where he used his mandate to haul oil as collateral to buy a ship.
  Tough times don’t last but tough people do. He had an unhappy marriage a ton of debt and bad business partners but from this he built his empire.

    - **Note:** tough times don't last tough people do this guy turned terrible positioning to greatness in 10 years he was positioned for the wrong world took advantage of different macro conditions to vault. His 2 paper system was a way to get extreme leverage he would borrow against a mandated contract to buy a ship to fulfill the contract. Leverage and risk very high but kinda genius these people lived on the edge and could've easily gone broke though
- Stay in the game long enough to be lucky. After 25 years he started to get lucky.
  The world is a mailable place that when you attack it with drive and passion the world will often reconfigure itself around you more quickly and easier than you think. Ludwig did this by finding the ultimate decision maker and put the pressure on him. There was a rule that all ships needed to be scrapped. He went to the people in charge and offered to split the proceeds with the committee they obliged and he was able to get more money.

    - **Note:** He stayed in the game compounded over time and got lucky doing the right things finding the power brokers pushing on leverage points and working like hell. Malleable world.
- Bribing the people in power and ends up sailing under flags other than the us because you can avoid taxes and pay lower wages. Yacht and private planes gave a ton of unlocked value. Daniel build a luxury yacht and used it to entertain politicians which helped him secure business. This was as much a business craft as any tanker and probably earned him more money than any of his other vessels.
  His main competitors were the Greeks Aristotle Onassis
  He moved from a ship builder to a multinational company. He mastered the business of integration. Going into adjacencies helps you build power and competence
  The us government executed a convert operation and hurt his key competitor who hauled Saudi oil. Espionage at its finest.

    - **Note:** He understood the keys to power and how to win their favor and influence. He used his yatch as a marketing expense. He optimized his business and grew from a dock worker to a secret billionaire bad boys move in silence.
- Opportunities exist on the frontiers of where most men dare not venture. It is often the case that the farther the frontier the greater the opportunity. You have less competition by doing the hard thing. Do what no one else is doing or do where no one else is doing it.
  When he was already a billionaire he went to Panama rented a boat and tried to see if he could actually do what he was trying to do. Importance of seeing from the front. He had trusted expert opinion in the past on other projects but this time he would ensure there was no issues. Only after he was satisfied did he give the go ahead on the project.
  He was also willing to buy stock.
  He wasn’t reclusive but exclusive only spending time with people he wanted to. Time is precious.
  He was driven to succeed at what lesser men deemed impossible compulsive one upsmanship and wanted to optimize profit for minimal outlays of time space and money. Deeds over words. Machines over men. Very ruthless Mechanical inventive mind.
