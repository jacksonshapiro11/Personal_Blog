### Highlights

- The potential consequences of AI automation in the legal industry
  Key takeaways:
  - Law firms using AI may charge less
  - Automated knowledge work may become increasingly deflationary
  - Physical labor may become more expensive
  - AI can help find relevant information in legal cases

  Yeah, we knew that was coming. And my partners and I were debating it. And what we thought of was, well, how much do you pay out of the $800 or $1,000 an hour that you charge to Harvey.ai? Maybe you're willing to pay 5% or 10%. But then the reality is that one of the most powerful things it does is is able to go into Westlaw, find all these cases and say, yeah, this is germane to the thing that you're working on right now. That's a very useful thing. But the N plus first law firm will also use that tool. And instead of charging $800 an hour, they'll say, well, we'll charge 600 bucks an hour. And we're still willing to give you five or 10%. So I just don't see a world where on the one hand, physical labor will continue to be more expensive, they'll demand more and more money to do the job that they're asked to do. And then knowledge work will become increasingly more deflationary because so much of it will be automated by AI that those folks will charge less and less. And there's going to be attention there. I don't exactly know what's going to happen. I did a couple of experiments this week.
  Speaker 3
  I've been rolling up my sleeves and playing with these tools. It's pretty amazing.
  Speaker 4
  And I've been trying to use them for actual tasks in our companies. What have you learned? What did you do and what have you learned?
  Speaker 3
  So I got on the open AI plugins, Greg, thank you. ([Time 0:23:20](https://share.snipd.com/snip/da22732f-0c47-4110-8859-1cde2b2f303c))
    - **Note:** Physical labor becoming more valuable while knowledge work is becoming less valuable due to AI.
