### Highlights

- A book is just some scribbles on a tree but it transports you into the mind of someone else. Books are magic - Carl Sagan.
  Writes one word at a time slow daily compounding
  The goal is to keep on keeping on and not get depressed. Every time he sits down it’s like the first time he’s ever wrote anything and doubts if it will be any good. This is after he sold 350mm books and he still has intense self doubt about his abilities
  Raised by single mother and wanted to be someone else.
  Believed that anyone has the capacity to create and make great things.

    - **Note:** The world is malleable and scribbles on a tree can change the future. The goals is to never stop to keep compounding eventually doing the right thing you’ll get successful. Believed in the agency of man to do great things and had extreme self doubt.
- Imitation proceeds creation - he started out by copying comic books at 6 then started to small small modifications to these stories before going out to make something novel.
  His mom was transient but then he family had them take care of her parents basically tieing her down and making her a share cropper on the land completely dependent on others she lived the rest of her life here trapped.
  Where ideas come from ideas come out of the sky your job is to recognize when two disparate ideas come together to produce something new and magical. (Einstein - your thoughts are the output of previous work that synthesize in your brain randomly then make themselves known)

      His mom lost her agency and was basically subservient for the rest of her life.
      Idea generation coming from 2 disparate ideas that come together to produce something Novel in your brain.
- Rejection - he remained young and optimistic and would nail rejection letters to his wall. Eventually he needed to replace the nail with a spike but he stayed vigilant.
  He wrote a book about a movie and sold it at school this was his first book.
  Critics are ever present.
  He learned how to write more in 10 minutes at a newspaper than at school. Writing is about telling the story to yourself rewriting is about taking everything out that isn’t the story. Write with the door closed rewrite with the door open Distill something to its essence. Frank Capra would take dr suess writing and only underline what advanced the story the rest he left blank. Tight story telling and discipline.

      Rejection and writing advice
- Derek sivers there is no speed limit - at 17 before he went to college for music and old man said show up at his studio at 9 am and he could teach him 1 year of theory in a few lessons. He was shocked when Derek showed up because most people don’t. Kimo Williams high expectations set the tone. Be a yardstick of quality and set high expectations. Derek bought the books for other classes and asked to take the final exam instead of taking the class. He finished school in 2.5 years. He was taught in 5 lessons the standard pace is for chumps and there is no speed limit. The importance of the council of someone older.
  Write for a key audience.

    - **Note:** There is no speed limit Derek skipped a year and a half of college with 5 weeks of study. There is no reason not to go fast most people don’t follow through don’t sign up.
- Show up every day and the inspiration comes. Inspiration is like sweeping the floor. Consistency over intensity. Writes 6 hours a day. Writing as a professional.
  He was living in a trailer and had no money then someone bought the rights to his book for 400k. He couldn’t even afford medicine for his sick daughter. He was broke with 2 kids he couldn’t afford living paycheck to paycheck his first big break he threw in the garbage his wife fished it out and said he had something the belief of her really pushed him through. So much struggle he wanted to quit many times. Hitting this big was a defining moment in his life.

- Struggled with alcoholism.
  Don’t come to writing lightly you need to be all in. Books are made of books you must write and read a lot. Steven enjoyed this. Find work that feels like play. Most humans quit and don’t do the work. Actions express priorities if you don’t want to do something. When you love something you do it until you bleed. If you’re dreading work find a new job.
  If you get stuck get bored go for a walk ect.
  Embew your character and touch into your work. Doing this taking a path that isn’t the norm is crazy and hard and lonely. Formidable people live in solitude.
  The scariest moment is right before you thought.
  Reading and writing is about enriching your life.

    - **Note:** His writing was a process of first finding his voice by studying others read and writing then intense practice.
      Actions express priorities find work that feels like play. You want to do something until you bleed because you love it.
      Veering off the path is scary and lonely. Presented vs chosen life path.
