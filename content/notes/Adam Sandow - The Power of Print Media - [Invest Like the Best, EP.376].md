- Innovative Business Model for Manufacturers
  Summary:
  The speaker devised a unique business model where they offered manufacturers free data structuring, warehousing, and lead generation services in return for a pay-per-transaction fee for connecting them with designers.
  This innovative approach eliminated the need for sampling, warehouses, and manual follow-ups for salespeople, streamlining the process. By leveraging their established media platform for customer acquisition, the speaker successfully created a model that satisfied both the supply and demand sides of the marketplace, addressing the challenging aspects of digital business such as customer acquisition costs and lifetime value.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And I started to talk to manufacturers like, I've got an idea. I'll take every piece of material, every piece of data, I'll do all the data work myself, don't lift a finger. I will literally build and normalize your data structure and put it on my website, no cost. I'll take every sample you have, bring an 18 wheeler, back it up to my building, I will load it into my warehouse, no cost. I want X dollars every time I find a designer that I've qualified that says I love that carpet, I want the carpet, I'll FedEx it overnight, I'll put all of that data right into your CRM. So your salesman does not have to do anything to wake up, have his coffee, and go, who got my samples? Who do I follow up with? And I'll charge you transactionally, I'll charge you cost per action. So manufacturers are saying, wait a minute, no sampling, no warehouses, no nothing. No, you're just going to put leads into my CRM and I'll pay you transaction like Google. Done. So we were able to build a model that supply and demand sides of the marketplace, we're very happy with. And because of that media platform that I spent the prior 20 years building, I had access to customer acquisition, which is again, talk about the hardest thing in any business with digital, Your customer acquisition costs, your lifetime value.

    - **Note:** They did something in next day shipping that seemed crazy people spent 12% of revenue on samples they fixed this by creating a way to ship and ship back overnight then they built and integrated crm so you know who got the samples to follow up with and like google you didn’t pay 10 cents per click but you paid $2 per sale. You can order 25 different things at midnight and get filled because they’re in Memphis with fedex who is the only person who could execute logistically. They did something incredibly hard built out their own fulfilment realized they needed to built it in specific place and this gave them amazing power.
