### Highlights

- The Weaponization of Food and Big Food Companies
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  What other system settings I guess would be the right term, could be incentives, could be just something else? In addition to the subsidies, do you think have most contributed to this problem?
  Speaker 1
  I think that our food has also been weaponized against us. If you think about, I realize I maybe sound like a conspiracy theorist or something here, but I think that if you look at a book called the Dorito effect or something like that, there's another book called Salt Sugar Fat where if you look, these big food companies, similar to Facebook, it's getting a bunch of blowback and TikTok and others, have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to try and engineer the perfect, palatable thing that you want to keep going back for. And so not only do we have subsidies, which means that cheap inputs go into everything, most of those products are controlled by six to seven big food companies that are just mammoth companies that control almost all of our food supply, especially in package form. But as these big food companies start to swap out real whole ingredients and whole foods for a processed sort of fake version of that thing, their profit margins go up. And so all of a sudden they have more money to pour into marketing, more money to pour into R&D cycle. Yeah, it's a cycle and more money to figure out, how do we make the Dorito the most addicting possible thing that one could put in their mouth? ([Time 0:14:51](https://share.snipd.com/snip/92343ccf-d16c-41a2-970e-91b26abec8d7))
    - **Note:** Food subsidies are much higher for corn soy and wheat 5-1 vs fruits and veggies. The system perpetuates itself and causes unintended consequences and doom feedback loops. The system perpetuating itself is the problem and the actors incentives are such that their optimal actions are bad for the system. That’s why there are more processed and bad shit in our food because the system is optimized for those inputs which leads to our western diet being very unhealthy. The food manufacturer wants to make it super addictive so people keep coming back.
- The Paradox of Health: Why we were Healthier When we Knew Less About It
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I started this business called Kettle & Fire when I was 26. Kettle & Fire now is the number one bone broth brand in the country for whatever that's worth. And when I started the company, I'll be honest, I was like into health. I was reading about it a little bit, but it wasn't this hair on fire thing that I'd gone super deep on just yet. As I was getting more into the bone broth space and starting this company, looking at marketing points, talking to influencers, talking to people in the health and food world, I kept coming back to what I said at the beginning of the show, which is I think the greatest mystery that people are not talking about, the Peter Thiel-esque secret, is that 50 years ago, we had so many fewer people, resources, everything to think about health and people were healthier. And now at a time when science has progressed, people are talking about health all the time, there's diet tribes everywhere. The average American is overweight, unhealthy, and has multiple chronic diseases. It's crazy. And so as I got more into understanding, oh, we're selling a health product, let me understand like the needs of my consumer, I just started talking to more and more customers, meeting more and more people. And I felt like almost no one was actually looking at this and going, this is wildly fucked up. Sort of everyone is just okay, maybe with the average outcome of health in the US being really bad. ([Time 0:24:45](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d3eeb937-2f60-4392-98e9-5d609dd3f9b1))
    - **Note:** Why are we putting more into health than ever yet we’ve never been more unhealthy. The only place to beat these people is to go where the competition can’t because it doesn’t make sense for them. These food companies like coke create negative externalities but don’t bare the cost.
- Personality Traits of Those Who Feel at Home in Edge City
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  What are the personality traits that you found of people that feel most at home in Edge City other than curiosity?
  Speaker 1
  I think that it is an extreme openness to being wrong. Literally, I would say 100% of the things that I've said on this podcast, I am open to changing my mind on in the next 10 years. There's a chance that it is true that ultra processed food and vegetable oils and all these sorts of things are actually like fine and fine and that it's like some crazy environmental chemical that is just wreaking havoc on the average American. A glyphosate and it just happens to be more in like corn, soy, and wheat, which means that it's in more processed foods. And so when you look and you go processed foods, vegetable oils, probably bad, it was actually just like no glyphosate in every processed food and it's just destroying people. I would say there's a chance that that is true. Do I think it is probable? No, but I think there's a chance. And so I think that there's an openness to new ideas to and a curiosity and sort of like ([Time 0:58:36](https://share.snipd.com/snip/353db2af-4919-41cf-9988-fa8386dc3d2f))
    - **Note:** Edge city which topic are you on the cutting edge of for one reason or another. The top .01%. Idea of secrets and being open to being wrong. Popperian idea of knowledge reach out to smart people on the edges of knowledge and get their ideas or takes. They generally are willing to talk and have a cross section of interesting ideas. The future will rely on fewer people who know the space and how to build better than others found multiple companies. Health system incentives are backwards because they only get paid when people are sick. Need to invest in prevention not recovery.
