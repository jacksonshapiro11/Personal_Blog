  You said earlier, I can't remember the number used. Let's say 10% of investors that are successful in terms of beating simple benchmarks or something like that over the longer term. Have you noticed anything in common between those investors?
  Speaker 1
  I have an entire class I teach called investment philosophies because I started with that question. When I started looking at it, I assumed that all these students have been grand. The old legend is and I discovered that when you look at the most successful investors over time, consistently successful investors over time. They're a mixed bag. You've got value investors obviously weren't buffet from that group. You've got growth investors like Peter Lynch. You've got traders like George Soros. I've never seen George Soros talk about the value of companies, a macro trader. So as I looked across these investors, what I noticed is there's no one pathway to greatness to God. There are multiple ways in which people seem to win. So then I started looking at what do they have in common to think. One is they have a core philosophy that remains unchanged over their investing life tax. Now I've had disagreements with Warren Buffett on things he says, but here's what you've got to give him credit for. He has a core philosophy, you know exactly what it is and it guides every strategy he adopts. So there's a core philosophy built around beliefs about markets and data that makes sense. The second is they have personalities that match up to that philosophy. We talk about everybody wants to be a long term valued investor, especially after you read three books on Warren Buffett. Of all those people who try very few people succeeds, he says, what goes wrong? Because to be a long term value investor, first you've got to be incredibly patient, which often is not under your control. Warren Buffett has insurance capital is investing. You and I might be investing our own money or clients money. So we've got to be able to be patient. And second, you have to be able to withstand peer pressure because you're often moving against the crowd. Those are psychological factors. If you're naturally impatient and you're swayed by the crowd, I don't care how many books about Warren Buffett you read, you're not going to be a successful value investor. When I teach that class, I tell people, there is no right investment philosophy, but there's one that's right for you. And to find that philosophy, the person you've got to understand is you, not Warren Buffett, not Peter Lynch, spend less time reading about other successful investors, spend more Time looking inward at the things that make you comfortable and uncomfortable. Because that is at the heart of building a successful investment philosophy that you can stick with in good times, which is easy, but also in bad times, which is not that easy.
  Speaker 2
  What were the important episodes of your own path to finding the investment philosophy that's right for you? Couldn't agree more with the alignment of personality and style and commitment, but it's always helpful to hear an actual story about how that came to be because it sounds simple when You say it. I think it can be quite hard to actually pull off in practice.
  Speaker 1
  I think with each big movement I talked about with PCs, with the internet, with social media, what I realized as I went further and further in is the tools I came in with. And the beliefs I had coming in, for shake. So when I came into the dot-com boom, I came with the old time value investor out. You need earnings, you need cash flows, you need them now, you need them on the balance sheet. And the more you went through the dot-com boom, I started looking at that and saying, maybe that's not right. We have to start to think about cash flows for growth companies, but there's very little here. So with each big shift where I've been wrong for an extended period, there's a point in time you have to make the judgment. It's not the market that's wrong. It's something you're missing, that you have to start to incorporate into your philosophy. It doesn't mean you've abandoned the way you think about market. I still believe value matters and have to invest based on value. But the way I estimate value, I've got to be pragmatic enough to expand it. I'll give you a very simple example. The first time I valued Uber, I valued it by looking at the car service business as it existed then. Car service business when Uber came into the market was composed of taxi cabs and limousine companies. And I went around the world, added up all of those, came up at the total market of about 100 billion. And he said, that's the total market. I ended up giving a value to Uber based on the total market. And Bill Gurley very rightly pointed out that I was missing something very critical that these disruptors in addition to taking share away from existing players could actually change The size of the total market. He said, you know what, there are people who are not taking car service now, who might start taking car service even Uber becomes ubiquitous. And he was absolutely right. And in subsequent valuation, Uber, I had to factor in the reality that this is a company that changed the size of the car service business. It was too late for me to fix my 2013 mistake, but I valued Airbnb. I brought that learning into the process when I said, how big can the market for hospitality be?

    - **Note:** You need to create an investment framework that plays to you and your strengthens. Some people are better being a value investor some a growth investor understanding yourself is key. You need to analyze your strategy and be mentally flexible to a changing world. We read too much and think too little power of an idle mind.
