### Highlights

- The babalonians took over and defeated the neoasyrians who only had an offensive not defensive army. This led to 300 years of Babylonian power. The Jews were captured and in an effort to preserve their history created the Bible. They were rare in that they didn’t fully assimilate. The capital of Babylon had become very metropolitan with a melting pot of cultures from conquests. Always think you’re at the end of history and you are in many respects. At this time the rich still spoke Acadian when most spoke Aramaic. The idea you had a surname associated with your job and was passed down like miller was common and could even be sold to others to make money. Beer was popular and produced everywhere. Slaves had owners named tattooed on their hands but their life wasn’t horrible freedom was preferred but few slave rebellions and evidence they could use their skills to make money. Slavery as a concept was very different apart of life and anyone could really become a slave so maybe changed the outlook and treatment. The Persians killed the empire destroyed the monuments and took power. Got rid of cuneiform. This was their grasp of power.
- In the old days priests would look at the stars and in the organs of goats for messages to tip them off to what the gods might have in store. The need to believe always present. These were put in books and rigorously documented by these priests and scribes. We want to categorize and make things scientific even when they make no sense we have always done that and we are still doing this. This is human nature it never changes. Irony need to believe power struggled oracles consulted. The idea this was all science. Crazy world. The ability to record and right down is actually why we have the constilation names we do today. The sky back then was so clear the Milky Way was visible and stars were everywhere. Unichs were vital to society and central to it. They had a lot of power. They also would read oil. This is how he appealed to the gods. They needed gods to be on their side so they needed to find the religious people whom agreed to support their claim. There was a conspiracy to overthrow the king eventually there were so many claims the king didn’t know who to believe. The idea of conspiracies covering everyone in doubt and obstructing the truth. The danger of conspiracy theories in society. They create division and issues. Religion and medicine were intertwined where medicine and exorcism were performed together by doctors. Eventually as a result of the conspiracy the king purged his court. Ironically the one guy who lived seemed like the chief conspirator so he either ratted or was a double agent. When the king died his son tried to correct the many ills that made his dad’s rule so unstable.
- She now talks about a conquering king who was pretty self center and consumed by power. Said he was ruler of the world because he had conquered most and believed he’d conquer the rest soon. Had 80 prefixes to his name talking about his glory and claimed great achievements himself like winning a war by himself of building a new capital city. He was the first to really build a metropolitan capital city from scratch. Often in the old times there was not open field warefare. Siege was much more popular. There was much art that was war propaganda. Did show humanity of other side but also gruesome beheadings of losing side. Often when something was conquered th people who lived there were deported. The neoasyrians created a way to maintain an empire by road building but also power games like deportation and killing of dissidents we know about this because the Israeli Bible. They upended people to make them unstable and not rebel. Once this empire system was invented it never went away. Implementation of wide scale empires.
- Phoenician script is what was used to write Aramaic went from hundreds of characters down to 20 or so basically creating the modern alphabet this was at the time between the bronze and iron ages when trade was scarce. These also had simpler shapes than the ornate cuneiform. The last group that came to prominence between the bronze and Iron Age was the Israelites. Not much else was known was a dark age for knowledge. The Israelites were a small kingdom but left legacy with the Bible that was a source of so much history and the source of western religion and civilization. Assyrian kings were all warriors and they dominated the world at this time. They only associate by war. These kings displaced many people but also created some great and detailed art.
- There was a 100 year period after peace before the empire fell apart which was a slow dissolution slightly more fighting compounding. The old rules were still followed and people didn’t recognize the chaos because it was all they knew but the system was faltering and being destroyed. Tough to see the fall in progress but the cracks in the system were clear and this turned into breaks. This combined with a massive drought led kings to beg for grain but few had grain to give and this led to further instability. Creates years of distress and war where a combination of drought and invasion created issues. There are mentions of the sea people invading the Mediterranean. Who these people were is unclear but their existence is doubted and controversial. They could’ve been Greeks invading our they could’ve been people from the empire migrating to find food. In this drought the international system came to an end. Instability killed the era. Even in this chaos the asyrian kings maintained their power while other kingdoms fell apart which gave them a huge advantage of continuity going forward in their control of the empire and world. Don’t die.
- The chariot was a big innovation of its time and used in warfare everywhere once invented. The late Bronze Age was a period of great diplomatic peace and progress where people decided to ally and not fight. At this time the first classes became More prominent with everyone serving in the army but higher class having more prestige and title. In Babylon class existed but wasn’t engrained in the social order as much as it was in this period. Trace stretched wide across Asia and into Greece and Europe. The kings of Egypt and Mesopotamia 3 kingdoms agreed to ally share goods view each other as equals instead of fighting. They standardized languages communicated in cuneiform and had scribes act as translator. They married to unite the families and got so much richer because they never had to spend on war. Having daughters was better than sons because only one son could take over but daughters were trained to be married off. Eventually though strong men wanted power and control and the previously enjoyed peace started to fade into conflict.
- During the good times society flourished but when bad times came uncertainty of rule followed and the empire started to fracture. It was no longer as big but had different kings for different area. Barbers were very influential as many prominent men were clean shaven and slaves had a specific haircut to differentiate them. Cutting their hair was a big crime because they couldn’t be differentiated otherwise. The idea damming a river was used as a war tactic as canals were important first water flows. This didn’t work. During the chaotic period information and scribes stopped working and knowledge was lost to time. Very few positive intellectual developments at this time.
- There were these women called naditum who were pledged to the sun god didn’t marry. They were children of rich men and they were given business opportunities to manager and build wealth. Houses and autonomy. These were respected business women. They grew their families estate this may have been done because there was not suitable mates of their class and this was a way to grow wealth and keep it in the family. Whatever it was these women were Rich had power and agency and respect. These women were supposed to pray to the gods to get the family in good standing with the gods. Scribes were taught in a rigid scholarship circulum that didn’t change for centuries. Some scribes became scholars and a lot learned complex math. This is proof of growth of society and excess wealth to pursue intellectual pursuits in life. Beatings were regular in school as punishment. Gilgamesh epic was very modern about love loss and friendship. After his friend died he wants to live forever but an innkeeper tells him to love his family and friends and love moral life to its fullest. The scholars learned cuneiform which was a dead language where most merchants just learned enough to do their trade and stopped school.
- When hamruabi took over he kept everything in place government laws and officials wise and just kept a tax. Also he didn’t really conquer until he was in his 30th year then in his last 13 he went on a spree. Took over the largest enemy who said they’d help him then started to hurt him with attacks and he took over went to war. He was smaller but still won because the king of the other city was old. Under hamraubis rule many people started to own land and kept an archive of their property in their houses. Land was also vital during this time. The king would sometimes grant land for soldiers to til instead of paying them for their service. Sometimes theirs to keep other times in service of the king. Being granted land was amazing gift and sometimes it wasn’t even the kings land and had to be returned so knowing that was vital. People given land for service couldn’t hire a replacement and would’ve lost their land and been killed for doing so. In practice people paid for replacements often with permission and weren’t punished. Ransoms could be paid to have captured soldiers returned and was common so people worth more alive then dead. The code of hamraubi wasn’t really weighted against rich or poor. Had decent balance where poor people owed less than rich people for stuff like medicine but it was anti slave and not helpful for them. Still there was social mobility. Slaves could move up or people could move down.
- Musicians were popular and good music cultivated. People weee paid and listed in a hierarchical way based on money and status. Musicians were trained and important. Idea that god loved music so it was important. Had an understanding of diseases but no actual science. When someone was sick they would seperate from them not use their cups ect. Some knowledge but couldn’t cure. Women who were single were kept in different areas from the men. Stories of prominent women being married off how most people had 1 wife other than kings who had as many as they wanted. Wives listed in importance.
- There was turnover and churn with constant fighting but the change of rulers in territories didn’t seem to come with bloodshed mostly was most destruction of property. The Anatolians were in turkey. In a critical pivot point between Asia and the Middle East. Assyrians came there and ran complex trading organizations. First complex known private trade. Silver was medium of exchange. Gold couldn’t be sold too valuable. Evidence of specialized labor. Wool from Mesopotamia was more than local. Tin was vital during this time as well transported from Uzbek to Mesopotamia. Kings took taxes from merchants but then would protect them and reimburse them for stolen goods. Merchant families were prominent. She talks about ashur idi who was a prominent trade who had a bad temper. Would often get rattled with small issues. Market psychology is human nature. Kings supported trade it was good for them. Valuable to maintain these good relationships with merchants. Large scale trade was vital. Wide scale trading was popular and profitable as things could be sold for double the price in Mesopotamia.
- Slavery was wide spread some were debotor slaves and could pay out some were enslaved for life. Some people weren’t slaves but had to work a specific job. Slavery was a spectrum. People sold kids into slavery to raise money.
- Sargon took the ideas of past kings to take over the entire known world and did so despite not being born into king position grabbed power took legitimacy from gods and conquered wide empire and ruled over disparate lands took a great admin state to do this. At this time the first emperor claimed to be a god. The emperor lost power maybe because the empire was too big maybe because of drought and volcanos creating unrest. Whatever happened the empire went back to city states but the idea of an emperor was implanted in kings minds and many used the Sargon inspiration for their ruling justification. Important movement in ruling ideas. After some chaos there was a rennisance like period where people looked toward the past for inspiration for the future. Switched from the conquerer mindset back to the humble king mindset. The first laws were found formalized from this period. He wanted to establish justice. The Mesopotamian people loved order and peace so these laws were important for the king to maintain that order. The laws were all conditioned men women and slaves were all punished differently for the same crime. Most were monetary fine policies not true eye for an eye. Death penalty was rare reserved for murder and rape/ improper marriage of women as well like a man marrying his brothers widow. Fixed wages interest rates prices rents and inherentence and divorce. The judges in Mesopotamia were prominent men not trained judges. Often people took oaths for the gods which they wouldn’t lie under normally so this is how decisions were made. Witnesses were brought evidence presented. There were no lawyers and prisoners weren’t used frequently but mainly to house people before trial. The idea that prison was also rehabilitation.
- Rituals were very important in marriage it was marrying for status not love uniting family ties and gifts were given both ways with rituals joining the family. Women had imense power but below the men’s power. Gift giving on a grand scale was vital to weddings. Sacrifices were made and gifts were given even to people not involved in the wedding. Then they went on a 4 week honeymoon where they took the statues of the gods around which were believed to be gods themselves. Visited the shrine of the dead. This was more spiritual than fun. The statues never left the palace so this was a big occasion no one would steal these but they needed security in case someone wanted to hold them hostage. While the kingdom stood for awhile it was raided plundered and burned seemlying at the height of their power.
- Period transitioned from uruq to dynastic first real kings. Writing started to be standardized. At this point even 5k years ago real estate transactions were seen as very important. The gods were even evoked to ensure the sanctity of these transactions. Data was also kept on conquests and prisoners. The people living in Mesopotamia thought they were at the end of 4000 years of history. There is also history of fighting and conflict over land by neighbors constantly. After this war the kings created the first known alliance and referred to each other as brothers. This showed kings would rather be at peace not war. Debt jubilee was executed by a king. There was a time when kings were burried with attendants who were likely members of the court but this tradition soon ended. Women were paid less than men generally. Women weren’t equal but they were important and had a prominent place in society. Textiles were the art of its time so female weavers were important as a result. They were making the art. Shows desire of humans to always have art. Women had respect power and influence. Living at this time wasn’t easy but wasn’t impossible. Mostly peaceful with rulers who wanted to be loved.
- Proto cuneiform was invented on stone tablets in 3500 bce. This was more like the token system with symbols not in order more meant to record admin details and be thrown away still this was the first evidence of writing seen. This was more used for tokens but as time went on the people started to associate with the goods with pictures and this is how writing may have been backed into. First from tokens for payment to tablets instead of tokens for admin then pictures. Was for record keeping. Early on it showed how Sophisticated the record keeping was and how many people the temple served. There was also a hierarchy with men paid more than women and supervisors paid more. Mostly in wheat and barely sometimes in meat for big holidays. It went from drawings to imprints then eventually just to lines and triangles for everything. This was reduced to number noun person and eventually words were invented for verbs like return. They eventually started writing this phonetically not with pictures but using pictures to sound out then language was a small movement away. The first written names appeared. Also symbols were used frequently demonstrating standardization and learned language. There were likely schools. Beer was the most drank thing but it was made with herbs not hops and was low alcohol content at times. The fermentation kept the drink safe and clean. There was complex math as well. There was a ton of innovation at this time in society. There were kings who owned land. Not much innovation after or before but this societal construct created innovation.
- Religion and gods were viewed very differently. Gods were part of the world. The god for the sun was inseparable from the sun. The entire world was cohesive. They saw cause and effect in their daily actions so abstracted that to things they couldn’t control like weather and assumed that human like beings controlled that. They saw themselves as subject to the gods. The word for the sun god and sun were the same. Conceptually couldn’t be split. Gods were recognized everywhere but some local regions prioritized some over others but all gods were real to everyone. Their entire life served the gods. Economy ect. The gods were seen as exacting their will on the people and prayer was to at least keep these people at bay if not stop them completely. They knew the gods could punish them for no reason. They just hoped to reach them in the right ways so they could be helped or left alone. Every city had a resident god. Everything served the gods.
- Continuity in the past in this book is the writing system is how its preserves. Family through this time was vital and ever present the bedrock of society. Social groups came and went but family was ever present. Family served as metaphor for other relationships and helped define hierarchies. Religion was also continuous and the same gods worshiped in 3000 bce were the same ones worshiped when Alexander conquered the region thousands of years later. They had no abstract concept of religion. The gods existed and controlled everything and made non negotiable demands of people and a lot of life was keeping them happy and making oaths. It was impossible to seperate the gods from the world. They didn’t know any better it was their best answer. Thought gods wanted the kings to rule. Justice was always sought and evil condemned world was ruled by powerful men and women. Women had more power at this time then they do now in the Middle East. People had been traveling for many years but cities were a new invention around 3-5k bce. Had language and religion for 10k+ yards before cities. People first settled semi permanently around wild wheat and barely then decided to start cultivating it themselves. Life was a very complex thing by the time of the first civilization. Uruq was 40k people one of the largest civilizations similar to Ancient Rome was absolutely massive and had a ton of knowledge. They didn’t have writing but they had other ways to keep track of stuff like clay coins. Pottery wheels also allowed for mass production. They had bowls that provided workers with cheap standardized food and building was very well planned.
