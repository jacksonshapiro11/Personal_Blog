### Highlights

- Commitment to the Many Fuels Purpose
  Summary:
  IKEA exists to enhance everyday life for many by providing affordable, well-designed home furnishings.
  The best leaders cultivate organizational commitment to a common goal, which for IKEA is to 'side with the many.' This principle is non-negotiable and reflects a firm stance on inclusivity and differentiation from competitors. Adherence to these principles defines 'the IKEA way' and reinforces their commitment to serving a broad audience.

  Speaker 1
  He is telling them why Ikea exists. And he says, to create a better everyday life for the many people by offering a wide range of well-designed functional home furnishing products at prices so low that as many people as Possible will be able to afford them. The best founders, the best leaders, they know their job is to get their entire organization's commitment to a common goal. So the very next sentence is a great description of IKEA's common goal. We have decided once and for all to side with the many. And so throughout Ingvar's life, he will constantly repeat these principles and he will also say, you are forbidden. You cannot change these principles ever. So this is the first one. We have decided once and for all to side with the many. This is an objective that carries obligations and he's immediately going to contrast. This is the way, the IKEA way, this is the principles, this is what we believe in. And he's going to contrast it to what everyone else does. He is telling them this is how we will be different. ([Time 0:07:34](https://share.snipd.com/snip/475e8527-94b2-4ab4-b4a9-6d4aa89f64c3))
    - **Note:** He has a clear goal. Believes most of society serves the elite but he wanted to serve the many. Most innovative company they rethink from ground up want to pass saving down. Clear principles constantly repeated. Break free from convention do it new and better. 5 principles. Low prices is #1 principle and purpose. Can’t compromise here. Founder is guardian of companies soul. Clear culture. All expansion was self financed never used debt. Funded with profit. Reach good results with small means. Relentlessly resourceful a solution without a price tag isn’t a solution anything can be solved with infinite resources. Those are a result of mediocrity. Do more with less money and time. Good results with less means. Simplicity is a virtue limit beauracracy. Don’t plan and have too many meets do it simple. Do it a different way unique problem solving. Search for reinvention constantly getting better. Constantly dynamism. Always wants stores to run decentralized experiments and learn as best they could. Like kinkos. Wants emergence. Concentration is vital. Can’t do everything so you must compromise. Do what is most important not the 10 most important things. Taking responsibility is a privilege. Don’t be afraid to make decisions making mistakes is the privilege of the active.
- Embrace Decision-Making as a Strength
  Summary:
  Concentration is a source of strength that leads to tangible results in work.
  Taking responsibility is seen as a privilege; those in organizations who prefer to make their own decisions contribute to a dynamic environment, while avoidance of decision-making breeds bureaucracy. A significant fear exists regarding making mistakes, which hinders decision-making and personal development.
  Embracing the idea that mistakes are part of active engagement allows individuals and organizations to thrive.
  This focus on decision-making counters the bureaucratic mindset that often arises from a fear of being wrong.
  A strong, forward-looking mindset fosters positivity, necessary for progress. Recognizing that most tasks remain to be accomplished encourages an ongoing journey of growth rather than stagnation. Happiness is found in the process, not merely in achieving goals. The concept of a 'glorious future' simplifies the belief that the impossible can be made possible. Furthermore, the importance of time is emphasized; every moment is a valuable part of life that should not be squandered on meaningless activities.
  Adopting a relentless, positive attitude towards challenges defines a proactive approach to both personal and professional life, fostering a community that collectively refuses to accept limitations.
  This ethos reflects a continuous drive for discovery and improvement, reminding us that true vitality stems from an ongoing, committed journey rather than a misconception of completion.

  Speaker 1
  Concentration, the very word, implies strength. Use it in your daily work. It will give results. Number eight, taking responsibility is a privilege. There are people at all levels in every type of company who would rather make their own decisions than hide behind those made by others. The fewer such responsibility takers a company has, the more bureaucratic it is. Constant meetings and group discussions are often the result of unwillingness on the part of the person in charge to make a decision. And so then he gets to why so many people are afraid to make decisions. They're afraid to make decisions because they're afraid of making a mistake. And he says this line over and over again. Only while sleeping, one makes no mistakes. Making mistakes is the privilege of the active. Making mistakes is the privilege of the active. Constantly practice making decisions to overcome our fear of making mistakes. The fear of making mistakes is the root of bureaucracy and the enemy of development. It is always the mediocre people who are negative who spend their time proving that they were not wrong. The strong person is always positive and looks forward. And finally, number nine, most things still remain to be done. A glorious future. The feeling of having finished something is an effective sleeping pill. A person who retires feeling that he has done his bit will quickly wither away. A company which feels that it has reached its goal will quickly stagnate and lose its vitality. Happiness is not reaching your goal. Happiness is being on the way. It is our wonderful fate to be just at the beginning. And I absolutely love that he said that because he's 33 years into running this company. And so I'm sure at the time, some people were like, yeah, okay, we're just at the beginning. You know, we're 33 years into this thing. But now 50 years after writing this, it was obvious that he was right. It is our wonderful fate to be just at the beginning. The positive joy of discovery must be our inspiration in the future. The word impossible has been deleted from our dictionary. Experience is a word to be handled carefully. Experience is a break on development. Many people cite experience as an excuse for not trying anything new. Bear in mind that time is your most important resource. You can do so much in 10 minutes. 10 minutes once gone are gone for good and you can never get them back. 10 minutes is not just a sixth of your hourly pay. 10 minutes are a piece of yourself. Divide your life into 10 minute units and sacrifice as few of them as possible in meaningless activity. Most of the job remains to be done. Let us continue to be a group of positive fanatics. Let us continue to be a group of positive fanatics who stubbornly and persistently refuse to accept the impossible. What we want to do, we can do and will do together. And then he ends with a tagline that he repeats over and over again. He says, a glorious future. Okay, so now I'm going to pick the book back up and I'm going to go straight into Ingvar in his own words, he's telling us the story of his early life and he's talking about the dynamic inside Of his family. And as he tells us about his early life and his early life plays out as the pages turn, more and more of my notes say the exact same thing. Revenge. It becomes obvious the source of his extreme internal drive. The that he works all hours of the day every day that he talks later on and in the book his biggest regret is that he missed out on his three sons entire childhood because all he did was work He had extreme levels of dedication and obsession with building ikea and when you look at his early life keep in mind the words that he i'm about to read to you he is these are transcripts Of interviews that he gave when he was 72. And so immediately he starts talking about his father, the fact that his father is forced to work on the farm by his grandmother. Ingvar's grandmother is the matriarch, the very powerful person in the family. She reminds me, she's like this Estee Lauder type of character, a personality and a person that dominates everybody around them. And so he says, my father was only 25 and he didn't want to be a farmer at all. But his mother's word was law, and he became her obedient tool. Similarly, father's brother had also wanted to go out into the world, but he still lived on the farm. Grandmother said, You're to stay at home, and so he did. My uncle finally chose the same route as his father, and he shot himself in 1935. I was nine. And so the backstory there, which I think also tells why his grandmother had to be such a hard ass, was they were German immigrants into Sweden. They had very few resources, almost no money, and their farm was failing, and Ingvar's grandfather took the easy way out. He had two or three small kids and his wife was six months pregnant and he shoots himself and abandons them. And so his grandmother finds herself in a strange country, no friends, a failing farm, and a bunch of children to take care of. So his grandmother absolutely dominates his father. Now he tells us about his mother. My mother was loved by everyone. She was an amazing person to whom nothing was allowed to be impossible. Mother soon discovered the poor state of my father's business affairs. So I'm going to pause there. What do we know? We know that he came from a family with very limited resources. His father allowed himself to be dominated and to be told what to do by other people. His father was very bad at business. His father did not have a lot of money. When you read about Ingvar's early life, this is a perfect illustration of this principle you and I talk about over and over again, that you can always understand the son by the story Of his father. The story of the father is embedded in the son. And he's going to say so explicitly in a few pages. So let's go back to his mom. Mom discovers, hey, my husband, the father of my children, is going to send us into poverty if I don't do anything. She discovered the poor state of my father's business, so she started a guest house. We rented out rooms to visitors. We rented out every room. Every room was taken except my parents, into which we all squashed together. My mother was a heroine in silence. He loved his mother. He admired her. He just said she was loved by everybody. Listen to what happens next. She contracted cancer before she was 50. She died at the young age of 53. I was 27. A few years later, I started up a foundation for cancer research that bore her name. This theme of revenge is ever present and reoccurring in his life. Fa... ([Time 0:21:38](https://share.snipd.com/snip/283f05c6-c452-4562-aefe-98b2d82b252c))
    - **Note:** Most things are yet to be don’t always more secrets. Always at beginning of infinity can do more and accomplish much in 10 minutes. His mom dies of cancer at 27 he’s still crying over her death at 72. She changed his life they had a hard life his grandpa killed himself to run from reality. His mom saw how bad of a financial state the company was in and chose to work her ass off to provide for the family. He admired her she died at 53. His dad was weak he chose to be strong. Story of the father embedded in the son. Constantly working. Getting revenge on his past to prove himself. At 10 he realizes his family is poor and he needs money to do things and focuses on getting means to make his dreams a reality. Trading was in his love and he learned from his grandpa. His grandparents believed a lot and saw much in him that inspired him to success. They were tough on everyone but believed in him and helped him. His grandpas country store goes out of business eventually he purchases it back with IKEA. Revenge constantly proving himself.
- Embrace Obsession for Innovation
  Summary:
  The founding of Ikea illustrates the importance of early interests and obsessions in shaping successful businesses.
  From a young age, the founder's fascination with distribution led him to question the pricing discrepancies in the market. This obsession with cost efficiency and quality became a driving force behind Ikea's philosophy, identified as a 'mortal sin' to waste time and money.
  Initial ventures included diverse products, with furniture sales sparked by a competitor's success.
  A pivotal moment came when the founder faced declining quality in mail order goods, prompting a shift toward physical displays that combined catalog sales with a showroom.
  This innovative approach addressed customer touchpoints, transforming Ikea's operational model. The company thrived due to strategic catalog marketing and a focus on cost awareness, establishing a brand culture rooted in helpfulness and thrift. Rapid growth demanded new solutions, leading to the introduction of in-store amenities like restaurants. Personal sacrifices were evident, with the founder torn between family and business responsibilities. Nostalgia for the intimacy of smaller operations surfaced, revealing the emotional complexities of scaling a venture.
  Overall, this narrative reinforces the significance of obsession and adaptability in entrepreneurial success, while also reflecting on the personal costs of such commitment.

  Speaker 1
  And so when he's 17, he founds the firm Ikea. The I is for his first name. The K is for his second name. The E is for the name of the farm he grew up on. And A is for his hometown. And so something that's common when you read a lot of biographies is you see that true interest is revealed early. So even before he founded Ikea, he was obsessed with something that most kids are not obsessed with, which is distribution. He did not understand why he could buy something so cheaply. And yet when he would see it in stores, it was so expensive to buy. And so he uses a term that I wasn't familiar with to describe this obsession. And I looked it up and it says it's an idea that dominates the mind, an obsession. And what he's talking about is that distribution became an idea that dominated his mind and it was an obsession. And so even before he had his own business, he would like go inside of like a shoe shop and he would see like this old fashioned way they had of selling stuff. They were like, well, you have to get on a ladder and you have to go up and down and just to fetch shoes. And he would look at things in all these businesses like this just cannot be rational because it seems to waste time and money. Remember, he says wasting time and money is a mortal sin in Ikea. It's something that he was obsessed of when he was a little kid. And so the first thing he does to start Ikea, he's just a mail order company. And he'll go and find importers and exporters and he'll become agents for them. And so before he ever tries to sell furniture, he's selling things like Christmas cards, seeds, fountain pens, wallets, picture frames, table runners, watches, jewelry, nylon stockings. And he actually gets the idea to start selling furniture from one of his toughest competitors, who is another mail order firm, this firm called Gunners. And when he's 22, he decides to try to advertise what he calls an armless nursing chair that he calls Ruth. And because he's dyslexic, he couldn't remember the order numbers. So he had to give, instead of having order numbers, he'd give all his products names, which still continues to this day if you order something from Ikea. And so right away, he realizes, hey, I think I stumbled into something very valuable. He says the response, once he advertises his chair, the response was unambiguous. We sold a huge amount. So then he doesn't stop just at chairs. He's like, okay, I'll advertise a sofa and a chandelier. And this was the result. Everything went. That was how the business started. People ordered on a mail order form from us and the factories delivered it to them. This is when he's going to go all in on furniture. And at the time, Ikea was a one-man business. But the demand was so great, he says, I could no longer remain a one-man firm. So in 1948, I appointed my very first employee. Two years later, the business had grown to a staff of seven or eight. And this is how he describes the turning point of his life. So by chance, the furniture trade, which I entered in in an attempt to imitate competitors, decided my destiny. No other event in life pleases me more than the fact that I ended up there. My interest at first was purely commercial, selling as much decent furniture as I could as cheaply as possible. Not until the first complaint started coming in did I realize that it was quality that was lacking. One day that would force me to draw certain conclusions and choose another way. What he's talking about there is combining a mail order catalog with an actual furniture store. And they did that because seven or eight years into the business, the business is about to die. And so he describes this time for us. Ikea was very much at a crossroads. Competition in mail order had become almost unendurable, a fact that one simple example can illustrate. So all the mail order, him and his mail order competitors, they're all ordering from the same manufacturers. So he talks about, hey, we're all selling the same ironing board. And so if I advertise it for $23, then my competitor will just come along and advertise it for $22. And then another competitor will just come along and advertise it at $21. And then eventually when we can't make money on that ironing board, we'll find another ironing board. And that ironing board will be cheaper, but also lower quality. And so he says, step by step, this price war affected the quality of the ironing board, which became worse and worse. The same applied to furniture. Complaints started to mount and I could see how things were going. The mail order trade was risking an increasingly bad reputation. And in the long run, IKEA could not survive in that way. The core problem with mail order was that the customers themselves could not touch the goods, but had to rely on descriptions in the advertisement and the catalog. So we were faced with a monumentous decision to allow IKEA to die or to find a new way of maintaining the trust of the customer and still make money. And so Ingvar is having a bunch of conversations with early employees at IKEA. It's like, how do we get out of this vicious circle of lower price, worse quality, then continuing lower price and even worse quality? And so the idea they came up with was, hey, why don't we try a permanent display or exhibition of our furniture? And so Ingvar has a choice, let his business die or take a risk and try something new. So he winds up buying a rundown out of business department store. He spent $1,600 to get the store and then he has to invest another like $75,000 to renovate it and get it ready to open. And so it is at this point in 1952 that he stumbles upon out of necessity to save his company, the blueprint upon which the future success that he's going to have rests upon. He says at that moment, the basis of the modern IKEA concept was created. And in principle, it still applies. First and foremost, use a catalog to tempt people to come to an exhibition, which today is our store. And so I think at the time this book is published, remember the book comes out in the late nineties, they have something like, you know, 300 stores like that. They had sent out by that time over a hundred million catalogs. And he was the first one to do this mail order and furniture store in one. That business idea had not been put into practice anywhere else. We were the first. And so he sends out all these catalogs with all his products and telling them where and when the first store was going to open. And this is the result. Success was immediate. But I have never been so scared in my entire life as we opened and saw the line outside. There were at least a thousand people there. I couldn't believe my eyes. There wer... ([Time 0:33:41](https://share.snipd.com/snip/beeebf76-5b1c-4f93-8a8e-977099129ad1))
    - **Note:** He sees the quality of the stores declining and decides to do it his way and reinvent the mail order catalog in ikea. He wants to do it different. The idea catches on and he keeps hiring and building idea was an accident but it makes his life. Founds it at 17. People go to great lengths to save money. Constantly watching costs making the customer experience better. No one thought it could work. People traveled so far they needed to build a hotel and restaurant to service demand. His family knew he was gifted. He always neglected his family. He really regretted not spending time with his kids. Loved when IKEA was a family.
- Embrace Mistakes to Foster Growth
  Summary:
  Insecurity and self-doubt can coexist with significant success, as evident in the experiences of successful entrepreneurs.
  Embracing and openly discussing past failures rather than hiding them can provide valuable lessons for future generations. Documenting the many losses and mistakes throughout a career, such as costly investments and poor decisions, illustrates that failure is a common experience.
  A philosophy emerges that making mistakes is part of active engagement, as those who do nothing make no mistakes.
  Fear of mistakes breeds bureaucracy and stifles development.
  Encouraging the acceptance of mistakes in the workplace can foster a more dynamic and innovative environment. Engaging in a growing market can also mitigate past failures, emphasizing the importance of taking risks and learning from them.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And they said, yeah, but it'd be a service to the future generation of entrepreneurs. And so he doesn't hide. What I would say, I guess, about this is Ingvar has an unusual personality compared to many of the people that you and I study. Way higher levels of insecurity. He's constantly crying. He's very sentimental. And he's still, even though his company is wildly successful, racked with self-doubt. But I think one of the best things he did for future generations of entrepreneurs is like he didn't try to hide that. He says, I have not been able to avoid severe losses. Both fiascos and triumphs have marked the history of the business. And he talks openly about all the many moments of weakness. He's like, I wept a lot. I couldn't bear adversity. Often I failed to look at things from the bright side. The sad thing is I didn't even learn much from these early failures. On the contrary, I kept repeating them. Fiascos have continued throughout my life. And so he goes through a list over the next several pages of all of these ideas and investments that IKEA did, where he lost millions and millions of dollars. And so he had the idea, we're going to sell TVs, let's buy partial ownership in a television factory. And in the 1960s, it said this one, one mistake was one tragic investment cost IKEA 25 to 30 percent of their total assets at the time. And he's like, but I didn't even learn from that because decades later I decided, hey, I'm going to dismantle a Swedish sawmill and I'm going to set it up again in Russia. And he loses about 12 to 15 million dollars on this because of the Russian mafia. This is his description of it, by the way. The Russian mafia, an endless Soviet-type bureaucracy. And the list just goes on and on. A terrible investment in Romania, a terrible investment in a factory in Thailand. He's like, we lost hundreds of millions of dollars on projects like this over the years. But even after all of this, he repeats his philosophy that only those who are asleep make no mistakes. Making mistakes is the privilege of the active. The fear of making mistakes is the root of bureaucracy and the enemy of development. And a few of his employees are interviewed in the book and they said that Camp Rad preferred them to make mistakes rather than to be idle. And so one thing that can help you overcome a lot of mistakes is if you're just in a great growing market and you're in there early. There's this concept that Charlie Munger talks about over and over again that he calls surfing. ([Time 0:44:15](https://share.snipd.com/snip/db7d7791-00a6-4615-875c-f50cfae90587))
    - **Note:** He’s constant insecure making massive mistakes with a bunch of self doubt. Repeating mistakes never learning. Prefers making mistakes. He rode a great wave of people moving to cities. Right place and time.
- From Adversity, Ingenuity Emerges
  Summary:
  Craftiness, defined as the ability to thrive with limited resources and navigate challenges, was pivotal in IKEA's transformation.
  When faced with competitive pressure and restrictive tactics from rivals, IKEA continuously adapted, turning obstacles into opportunities. Organizational bans at trade fairs merely propelled Ingvar Kamprad to innovate ways to showcase pricing, intensifying the competitive edge.
  When suppliers were boycotted, IKEA's commitment to prompt payment fostered loyalty among some, enabling discreet deliveries despite challenges.
  This adversarial pressure led to product differentiation through design innovations as IKEA sought alternatives, including international sourcing.
  The ultimate result was the realization of flat-pack furniture and self-assembly solutions, which reduced costs and enhanced their market position. Each hurdle reinforced IKEA's philosophy of viewing problems as possibilities, catalyzing continued growth and distinctive design.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Is the turning point of IKEA into a truly differentiated business. And so it's this idea of craftiness. And I love Ingvar's definition of craftiness. So he defines craftiness the following way. The craftiness is the ability both to be content with the resources one has and to find ways out of tight spots. And so one of the benefits that IKEA enjoyed once they moved away from just a strictly mail order is the fact that they saved on shipping. They have a store. Their other competitors do not. All the other competitors are strictly mail order. And so as IKEA's costs get lower and the efficiency increases, the prices go down. And so all of IKEA's competitors could not match IKEA's prices. So they band together and there is a trade association. It's the National Association of Furniture Dealers. And so the National Association of Furniture Dealers does everything in its power multiple times to try to push IKEA out of business and get in the way of Ingvar. Remember that definition as of craftiness, the ability to get your way out of tight spots. So the first thing they do is at the time, trade fairs were really popular and it's a way a lot of people discovered in furniture they want to buy. So he brought stuff from the store to the trade fair. And so the trade association said, hey, you can't do that. It's against the rules. Fairs are just for showing items, not selling them. So they managed to get him banned from selling at trade fairs. He's like, that's fine. I'll still attend the trade fairs and I'll make sure that my prices are prominently displayed. And since his prices were so much lower, they then go and get him banned from even advertising the price of his furniture. And here's a description of this in the book. A ridiculous game developed in which petrified conservative sales thinking was up against a new and insolent price pressure. Ikea was banned again and again again from doing anything, but kept finding new ways of getting around each ban. If the company was not allowed to appear itself, it would send another Camprad-owned company exhibit or some reliable supplier. In a letter from the National Association of Furniture Dealers, Ikea was likened to a monster with seven heads. If you cut off one, another soon grows. So eventually he gets tired of this and he starts his own trade fairs. And then another tactic that the National Association of Furniture Dealers decided was like, hey, we're going to cut you off from your suppliers. So they sent out, they organized the boycott. They told all their suppliers, listen, you can sell to one firm like Ikea or, you know all of us. But if you sell to IKEA, we will no longer buy from you. And so now they're starting to lose supply. Now, there are a bunch of them said, OK, we're not going to sell to IKEA anymore. Some of them, I need to back this up because this is actually really important. We called nursing the supplier. So I talked about this last week with how SpaceX paid its vendors. They paid like, you know, and their competitors would pay like 30 or 60 or 90 days later. SpaceX would give you the money that day. And so because they wanted their parts as fast as possible. So they're like, well, how do we get our parts as fast as possible? We treat our suppliers better than anybody else. Ingvar did the exact same thing. So a manufacturer is giving an interview in this book and he talks about the difference between Ikea and other furniture dealers. IKEA paid within 10 days, while others did not pay for three or four months. Nursing the supplier is one of Camp Rad's principles. One, he still imparts to his staff until this day. So as a result, some suppliers are saying, okay, I can't break this boycott. I'm sorry, I can't sell to you. Others remain loyal to IKEA, but they would to like deliver things to other addresses. They would remove the logos from the delivery van so they could hide that they were the company making a delivery to Ikea. They'd do deliveries in the middle of the night so no one would find out. And what his competitors and adversaries didn't understand is this constant pressure from them was a blessing in disguise. Because for one way around the boycott, they're like, okay, you won't sell us this chair because, you the other people buying this chair from you as well said, if you sell to us, they won't Buy from you anymore. Okay. What if we make like slight alterations to the design and the suppliers are like, oh, well, I can sell you that because I'm not selling that to them. And so they start having a differentiated product, a product that none of their competitors are offering at prices, their competitors couldn't match anyways. And then the second way, this was a blessing in disguise. I guess it's the second out of maybe three ways. So the blessing in disguise was the fact they're like, OK, this boycott and this constriction applies to the country of Sweden. We need to start looking abroad for new suppliers. And so another turning point in Ingvar Kapanpratt's career and the history of IKEA is the fact that they start sourcing materials in Poland. And so this is what Ingvar said about that. The boycott simply reinforced our unity. It was a crisis that became a non-crisis as we kept finding new solutions. Remember, you cut off one of their heads, another soon grows. In IKEA's business philosophy, the whole matter should be inscribed as a golden rule. They regard every problem as a possibility. New problems created a dizzying chance. When we were not allowed to buy the same furniture as others, we were forced to design our own. And that came to provide us with a style of our own, a design of our own. And from the necessity to secure our own deliveries, a chance arose that in turn opened up a whole new world to us. That was the beginning of our designing our own furniture. And then that is going to directly lead to one of their innovations, which is going to drastically reduce their costs and further differentiation them from their competitors. It's going to lead to flat packing and self-assembled furniture. It didn't look that way at the time. It didn't feel that way at the time because he's talking about crying himself to sleep. He's completely depressed. He's very stressed going through all this. But it was the best thing that could have ever, this boycott was the best thing that could have ever happened to him. And so here's another example of them turning a problem into unlimited possibility. So they're now designing their own furniture. ([Time 0:47:49](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a4411624-74fa-400a-894c-a3da95e285f3))
    - **Note:** They relentlessly resourceful, always turning problems into opportunities. They are constantly put under pressure by suppliers, but they use their resourcefulness and craftiness to get out of it, and these problems actually lead them to designing their furniture and differentiating and being a more stable long-term business. They realize that they have to have the people assembled the furniture, but it creates an endowment effect which is beneficial
