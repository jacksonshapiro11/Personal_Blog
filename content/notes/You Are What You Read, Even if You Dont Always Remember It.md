- > the goal of a book isn’t to get to the last page, it’s to expand your thinking.
  I have to constantly remind myself of this. Especially in an environment that prioritizes optimizing and maximizing personal productivity, where it seems if you can’t measure (let alone remember) the impact of a book in your life then it wasn’t worth reading.
  I don’t believe that, but I never quite had the words for expressing why I don’t believe that. Dave’s articulation hit pretty close.
  Then a couple days later my wife sent me this quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson:
  > I cannot remember the books I've read any more than the meals I have eaten; even so, they have made me. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxd25hrqfmwgnj0k917wbff5))
