    - **Note:** Life has no inherent meaning you embed it into your life. Carve a north start you must embed and create change in your life no one can for you. Only by living fully in the here and now can we experience true life. We can change the world but only we can change our own world perception and we must. We are very powerful
      Take agency change the world.
- Don’t live on route but in the here and now only. Life without a destination just in the moment. Kinetic life focused on going from point a to be as fast as possible if you want to be a lawyer your life is incomplete until you do so vs energile life which is life is what has been formed. What is now forming is what has been formed the movement is the outcome. Life is in the here and now past and future don’t exist. Live earnestly in the moment. Life is a not a story but series of moments wiry the future as a blank page. Life is just doing what you can in the here and now there is no story. Live earnestly in the moment. Don’t postpone life. Today is not a preparatory moment for your path it is your path. You can study for future things but you need to be in the moment. We can’t postpone life and be patient we need to shape our lives. Live earnestly not too serious. If you always live in the moment your life is always complete living in the moment creates a complete life. Don’t shine a light on invented past and futures only into the here and now. Life has no meaning inherently

    - **Note:** Life is a dynamic thing not a place you need to go. Live in the present and in the moment. Write the story of your life every day don't postpone life every day is preperation for the life you will live and the path you will blaze. Live whimsically and faithfully in the now. Past and future are illusions and the present is all there is.
- Contributing to others is not a selfish but selfless goal. Life lie is when we look at one point of our life and ignore all others like focusing on work or something else and ignoring everything else like family. We cannot find happiness through acts but only through being can we achieve happiness. Happiness is the feeling of contribution to others. One needs to have freedom which is the key to happiness and avoids relying on the recognition of others. Being of use is all that matters. We must have the courage to be normal. Life isn’t a line but a series of discrete dots. Life is a series of discrete moments and cannot really be planned no matter how much we’d want to do so life is constant discrete moments that come together but can only be lived moment to moment.

    - **Note:** Life is constant moments lived out over years so it may look like a line but we should love the journey. If we don’t fall in love with the journey and just want the destination we’ll never live because life is just a journey the destination is death. This is similar to the quantum view of free will and time in multiverse
      Life lie is over optimizing an area of life while neglecting others this leads to failure.
      Happiness isn’t in acts but a state of being which relays on internal markets and rejects outside approval. Happiness comes through contribution to others.
- Self acceptance over self affirmation we need to see the world as it is not as we want to ti be accept we can change and try to do so. If we get a 60% on a test we need yo accept we’re a 60% person but we can change and grow to become a 100% person we just need to figure out what characteristics are malleable in order to do so. Attachment to self vs concern for others requires confidence in others or believing in others. Trusting in others without any firm security to do so trust with an unsecured loan based on confidence in men. People won’t trust us if we doubt them so we must create a baseline of supreme confidence in others. We need foundation of confidence to build a deep relationship courage to create this comes from self acceptance is key to any relationship that has success. See people as comrades.

    - **Note:** We need radical self acceptance before we can make self improvement accept we are fallible and malleable then focus on what to improve and what we can improve. 
      We need to trust others if we want them to believe in us and love us sometimes this is a blind trip through the trust forest but we must do this to cultivate great relationships
- Be grateful for the existence of others. Just being there and apart of your life is cause to be greatful start from 0 not the view of the ideal child or spouse. Someone had to start without regard to whether others are cooperative or not.
    - **Tags:** #love-for-others, #grateful, #graditude, #accompanying-others, #relationship, #bottoms-up-not-top-down
    - **Note:** Be greatful for others start with a foundational gratitude for others everything else is gravy. Start with a bottoms up appreciation of others
- Praise and punishment are bad motivating factors to create desired behavior because it creates a hierarchical relationship where there is asymmetric power we want to create horizontal relationships with balanced or measured power dynamics. Created balanced horizontal relationships not vertical ones because that creates judgements and inferiority complexes but horizontal relationships create separate but equal relationships intervention comes from manipulating vertical relationships. There is a difference between intervening and assisting you want to encourage and support others. Need to give people the courage to face their tasks. Giving praise is a judgement from someone with ability to someone without ability. People have worth when they feel they are beneficial to the community. Give thanks but not hierarchical praise. Being of use to others makes someone feel our own worth.

    - **Note:** Create horizontal not vertical relationships with power structures. Give genuine thanks and allow others to help you support and encourage others. People evolve and become more than themselves transcend themselves when they have support from others in strong relationships.
- To avoid being self-centered, you take an active commitment to the world. You do this by facing your life, tasks of friendship, work and love. While taking steps forward in your own. You need to stand on your own 2 feet and think not what can this person give me but what can I give this person. This is a commitment to the community community feeling is realized through one’s efforts to improve the world not something shaped at birth. The community includes not only people you know but intimate objects and the universe. The world is fully connected and goes beyond things we cannot see. We belong to many communities like our houses and countries but also to the world and universe. When we see the larger community we avoid getting trapped in smaller communities like schools and allow us to transcend those communities not get stuck. Don’t cling to or compromise to fit in with smaller communities be yourself and live the life you are being true to not compromising for others.

    - **Note:** Don’t compromise we live in a global world and community we must see the world this way not through our eyes but through the eyes of others. You need to stand resolute prop yourself up and be a positive impact on others. Never compromise. Active commitment to the world. Deep commitment.
- All problems are interpersonal relationship problems but interpersonal relationship are the source of happiness as well. Create a community feeling to create a societal source of happiness. When you expand from yourself to your community you replace attachment to self with concern for others. Fearing to be judged by others makes you self centered. When you care about how others look at you you become self centered because you care about the I not the community. Don’t concern yourself with how others see you. That makes you self centered. Self centered people look at relationships and think what’s in it for me. They never consider the other person. You need to realize you’re not the center of the world a map places a country in the center based on who makes it like French maps put France in the middle while American maps put America in the middle so we can do that with ourselves where we see ourselves as the center or we can take the view of the globe where we’re a part of the whole and there is no center.
    - **Tags:** #care-about-others, #self-consciousness, #self-centered, #community-formation, #cultive-relationships
    - **Note:** We should be community oriented and invest in relationships without expectations of getting something back. We are the center of our world but not the world. Consider others as well as yourself don’t be self centered think of others.
- Freedom comes from being disliked because that means you are living life bottoms up instead of top down with others in mind. Freedom is viewing the world and pulling yourself up by your bootstraps and progressing by resisting instincts to stop ourselves from rolling downhill and climb upwards that is freedom. You need to be unconcerned with others judgements that is true and real freedom. Don’t want to be disliked but you can’t get mad or care if people dislike you. You can associate people with negative things to sabotage a relationship with someone else but it doesn’t help you so why do it. If you keep thinking of your dad hitting you it doesn’t help anyone but gives you an excuse for trauma. I brought up the memory of getting hit because I didn’t want to repair my relationship but if I have the right goal I can take the right steps. You must create a goal to repair relations and you have complete control in repairing relationships if you repair relationships it doesn’t matter what others think because the separation of tasks you can only control your tasks and shouldn’t worry about others so you repair your relationship with someone whether they care or not. Don’t change to change someone else you can’t do this or what to change people don’t manipulate people into change. Don’t need recognition or you give the control of your life to others.

    - **Note:** The freedom to be disliked is powerful. You shouldn’t actively want to be disliked but if someone doesn’t like you, it shouldn’t have a negative effect on you. You put yourself out into the world through relationships and accept consequences. Resist negative compounding and strive for freedom. Don’t associate with negative people or big up past trauma it doesn’t serve you. You can repair a relationship internally with someone without them accepting that and you’re feeling on the relationship is all that matters and all you can control. You can’t change people or force people to change you need to accept them how they are.
- Dont rely on recognition from others to be happy. Dont live to satisfy others expectations live your life. The idea of this psychology is you can lead someone to water but can’t make them drink you can aid people but you can’t take control all success or failure must be theirs. You can’t take on anyone’s tasks but yours. Gordian knot Alexander the Great needed to unravel a knot to conquer Asia but instead cut it with his sword sometimes we need to be direct. Never be at the mercy or controlled by others. We must not be tied to rewards. Separation of tasks what you need to do from others what you control and don’t. You need to have the courage to be disliked to avoid being disliked you need to constantly kiss peoples asses but then you’re creating false reality. If you live to satisfy others expectations you are lying to yourself and others. Live your life free as you want. That’s choosing the will to be free.

    - **Note:** The courage to be dislike this encouraged to be yourself. People will like you if you’re constantly kissing their ass, but you’re living a lie. Don’t look for others approval or play the game others do like the Gordian not you can cut it. You can’t change people you can just give them everything they could need. Do what is yours to do.
- Feeling of love no need to have oppressive of strain love comes from being able to behave freely with another. One can be calm and natural without having to feel superior that is love. You must treat the one you love as an equal. Work relationships are relationships that are predicated on needed other people to work with but no one works alone this is corgial but not too much either way. Friendships are based on distance and depth. When we look for ways to end relationships we look to or manufacture flaws that didn’t previously exist to justify our actions. Coming up with false pretexts to avoid the life tasks is the life lie. You lie to yourself to make excuses about your lifestyle when it’s on you to shape it. Avoiding life tasks with life lies is lacking courage more than anything.

    - **Note:** Good relationships are calm and balanced. When we want to end a relationship we manufacture reasons instead of just being adults with ourselves and the situation. Good relationships are calm without effort. Don’t create life lies. Friendship is based on depth and distance. Be calm and present with loved ones. Don’t create flaws and fool yourself.
- Health inferiority comes from comparing us to our previous self’s and improving. When you compare yourself to others you create competition with all others and create enemies of everyone instead of being happy. See everyone as comrades and allies love everyone. When challenged to a power struggle don’t give in this kicks off the revenge phase of the relationship the only way to move on from these personal attacks just remove yourself and don’t respond move on communicate through language in power struggles but mainly avoid them. Don’t rely on anger to communicate. Don’t criticize other in power struggles. Only when you ignore winning and losing you can properly progress. Don’t lose courage keep clear objectives for your life tasks. Behavior should be self reliant and live with society and we have the ability and others are our comrades. Self reliant while living within society. Life is split into tasks of work friendship and love collectively life tasks.

    - **Note:** Work friendship and love are our life tasks avoid zero sum power struggles and fight with others just create positive sum relationships rooted with love at its core. Compare yourself to your previous self not others self improvement and internal locks of control. Avoid anger communicate through love.
- Life isn’t a competition we need not compare ourselves to others to feel complete but should focus on progressing within our life not looking at others and wanting to be there.

    - **Note:** Life requires internal orientation and competition not external.
- A lot of our issues arise in relation to our relationship with others. All problems are interpersonal relationships problems. Envy rules the world. Value is based on social context. We have or create a superiority and inferiority complex. Inferiority can inspire us to do more but likewise can cause a lot of problems and unhappiness when we constantly compare ourselves to others so we need to balance these things. Feeling inferior means you lack something in the present but how do you compensate for what is missing the best way is through striving and growth but you can also develop an inferiority complex. Another way to feel superior is to fabricate it by associating yourself with famous people or clothing this is a superiority complex but at the base is inferiority. Those who boast are insecure. Superiority and inferiority are two sides of the same coin. Talking about the benefits to modern victim culture.

    - **Note:** All our problems are interpersonal relationship problems it’s actually a bit profound because if we had no issues we’d probably be happy given we have the basics handled these days. Inferiority or superiority which is just masquerading inferiority runs our lives. We feel inferior on one social dimension so we compensate sometimes this can be through improvement other times through social signaling. We feel we lack something in the moment we must accept happiness in the now.
- We must choose in this and every moment happiness and have the courage to be happy. You can’t dream about change you need to do it don’t commit to the dream of doing something and be subdued by the opioid of hope but grow through the rewards of action when you want to do something but don’t you actually don’t want to you just want the fantasy but you live in fear. Hope is dangerous take action. We need to be willing to try to succeed and maybe fail to properly move on. You determine your life in the here and now. We want to create excuses and sabotage ourselves so we don’t feel like failures but that the world isnt out to get us and we can’t possibly succeed because of it.

    - **Note:** We must choose happiness and not give into the opioid hope. Are we not doing something so we keep the hope of that other life alive. Don’t live in fear or put your life on hold but you determine your life in the here and now don’t sabotage it live it.
      Make an active commitment to yourself every moment to live the life you want and be happy
- We have agency over our lives not as past causes that make us one way but present goals. Humans do t experience trauma but we assign meaning to past events and create trauma perception vs interpretation. We give meaning to past experiences and choose how we live we can choose to be upset at trauma or move on. We gave control over our emotions this is basically inner control and perception interpretation gap. We’re not controlled by emotions or the past and we yell and get angry because we want to. We have the power to change who we are. No one chooses evil or unhappiness we choose these things because they are good in a story we tell ourselves. We choose our personality we can create ourselves.

    - **Note:** We have the agency to write our story. When we are negative we are making an active choice in that negative mindset. The past doesn't define us nothing defines us except the decision we are making right now forcing an action that is who we want to be as a person in this moment and future moments. We will often live stories that don't serve us because the counter factual is scarier. Life is about creating yourself. You perceive things but then you can interpret them different and govern your life how you want. You have agency trauma is a story you tell yourself everything is a story you tell yourself. Rewrite those stories. Feelings are just meaning we give to past experiences but these can change whenever we want. Define yourself in this moment and forever. Take control over your life.
      We have agency over the story we tell ourselves
