  Speaker 1
  An able man is a man who can do things. And his ability to do things is dependent on what he has in him. What he has in him depends on what he's started with and what he has done to increase and discipline it. An educated man is not one whose memory is trained to carry a few dates in history. He is one who can accomplish things. A man who cannot think is not an educated man, however many college degrees he may have acquired. Thinking is the hardest work any one can do, which is probably the reason why we have so few thinkers. There are two extremes to be avoided. One is the attitude of contempt towards education. The other is the tragic snobbery of assuming that marching through an education system is a sure cure for ignorance and mediocrity. You cannot learn in any school what the world is going to do next year, but you can learn some of the things which the world has tried to do n former years, and where it failed and where it Succeeded. If education consisted in warning the young student away from some of the false theories on which men have tried to build so that he may be saved the loss of the time in finding out by his Own bitter experience, its good would be unquestioned. A man's real education begins after he has left school. The true education is gained through the discipline of life. That is an excerpt from the book thati m ong talk t you about to day, which was published a hundred years ago, and is my life and work, the autobiography of henry ford. So back on episode two, 63 an that biography of edwin land is called land's poloary toa company nd the man who invented it. In chapter three, it goes through all the diferent heroes and people that edwin land was studying, like the great people that came before him, that influenced his approach to a buildingis All f his work, really, his scientific work, and the building of poleroid.

    - **Note:** Education doesn’t come from a book. Those are pieces of paper and true education comes from understanding the past and applying it to the future. Criticital thinking is not an output of education but the sole goal of it yiu need to discover for yourself through life. True education is gained through the discipline of life. Founders have big egos but the good ones hide it. Business exists for one reason to serve other people. Make a product that makes everyone’s life better. Almost everyone has ideas but not everyone can productize those ideas. Detests lazy people. He believed in his principles and his system you don’t copy the what but the how. Business are supppsed to be hard abs require deep hard work and dedication. Humans are not made to be lazy but to find purpose through hard work and struggle. Ford wanted to provide the best service at the lowest price. Money chasing is not business but you need to produce for consumption. He was living in a cyclical boom time where money was cheap and plentiful. A producer must make a product that serves the people. If you’re constantly providing value to customers you have no business it will break eventually. Customer focused like Jeff bezos. Ford’s philosophy- Get rid of waste increase efficiency through technology cost focused drop prices and still make higher margins watch your costs religiously.

  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Barnes ond nobles is opening an on ligne store. And this is what bas was told, told his team, look, you should wake up worried, terrified every morning. But don't be worried about our competitors, because they're never going to send us any money anyway. Let's be worried about our customers and stay head down focused. Sthats ha main theamg of basoss like this an yu nedto be focused on your customers over your competitors. And as long as you're serving them, don't give them a reason to go anywhere else. And if you do that, they won't go anywhere else. So this everything i'm reading to comes across lik several dfferent pages. Nd, kind of putp altogether. And then this is the note i was really thinking is like, how can i, i need tot take this, like 500 words or whatever. This is need t i need to compress this so i can actually take this with me. And so i wrote like, ok, how can i distil what i is my understanding of henry ford's philosophy? So it's, get rid of waste. Increase efficiency through thinking and technology. Drop your prices and make more money with lest less profit per car. Watch your cost religiously when needed, bring that business process in house, and always stay focussed on service. Fast forward a few pages. He's back at it again. Being greedy for money is the surest way to not get it. But when one serves for the sake of service, for the satisfaction of doing that which one believes to be right, then money abundantly takes care of itself. This next sentence, i think it's my favorite. He's got a lot of good quotes. This is y, this is my favorite. ([Time 0:19:57](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8eeecb6b-4f3c-4924-a68f-62409569a4bb))
    - **Note:** Money comes naturally as the result of service the score takes care of itself. Wanted to make simple products at scale. Started with a 6k car that no one could afford and stripped out the excess to get them affordable to the every man. He was counter positioned against the market by going after the low end that didn’t exist and make it cheap and grow the market. He saw the wood in the car and thought how heavy it was and how he could reduce weight. He did this 10k times for every part of the car. He detested lazy. He had been thinking about this for 2 decades and worked backwards from there he made 10 cars before the model T and when it was in prod the game was over bad boys move in silence. He could do in 12 minutes what his competition needed 2 days for his advantage had compounded out of control. Took 12 years hates waste and greed. Waste is a result of ignorance and you need deep industry expertise to avoid waste. There’s no short cut to putting in the time. Greed is the result of being nearsighted. He had one idea for a car and it took him decades to perfect this. GM unseated him by not making one great car but tiers of cars that met different needs in the market of differentiation that ford missed. One idea at a time and perfect it. Was building a car in 1893.
- Two legendary founders with different philosophies: A lesson from Microsoft and Apple
  Key takeaways:
  - Two legendary founders in one industry with different philosophies
  - Changes in a product come from experience, not changing the basic principle
  - Better to concentrate on perfecting a good idea than searching for a new one
  - Focus on tasks that machines can't do better than humans
  - Early interest in mechanics and transportation
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And really take away theirs, like, ok, one industry, you have two legendary founders. They both have completely different philosophies. And some times the philosophi's work depending on the time. Like, think about microsoft and apples, a kind of a good parallel to that. Sonras, didn't mean to go on that tangent. He sang, listen, that first car, it's like a lot worse, but it's very similar to this five million car. He says, the changes have been brought through experience in the making, and not through any change in the basic principle. Espencially, i had one idea. I'm not changein that, i'm just geting better actually expressing that idea in a physical car, which i take to be an important fact, demonstrating that given a good idea to start with. It is better to concentrate on perfecting it than to hunt around for a new idea. One idea at a time is about as much as any one can handle. And now he gets into oka. Why the hell you build in a car in 18 93? Anyways, it was life on the farm, farm that drove me into devising ways and means of better transportation. For even when i was ver young, i suspected that much might somehow be done in a better way. He always says this, like, a man should never do something that a machine can do better. Like that, we should that tat be our main focus. And he starts out thinking about, sike, how can i get myself out of physical labor through mo though, like building motors on a farm? That is what took me into mechanics. Although my mother always said that i was born a mechanic. I had a kind of workshop with odds and ends of metal for tools before i had aything else. My toys were all tools, and they still are. ([Time 0:31:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b273f1b4-8aef-4e73-a2e5-fe31ac64e19e))
    - **Note:** A man should never do something a machine could do better. He always had a nack for machines since he was on the farm in 1893. Machines are to a mechanic like a book is to a writer he saw his first car at 12 and fell in love with it became his life’s work. His parents wanted him to be a farmer and tried to get him to change and semi disowned him. The car changed the world made the world smaller. People thought why do you need cars when you have horses. The easiest way to sink a competitor is to fill them with experts. He constantly questioned accepted wisdom and this lead him to be one of the first people to seriously consider a gas car. Wise people always know the limitations and are sure things can’t be done which is their weakness. The internal combustion engine was viewed by all experts as inferior to steam but ford didn’t believe them and saw for himself. He worked full time and would build cars at night and on the weekends. Relentless practice. The public praise what people practice in private. If you can’t handle the work load someone else will. He didn’t only handle the work load but enjoyed it. The entire world was electric and they told him gas wouldn’t work but he resisted that. Very counter positioned. Even his boss said gas was foolish and electric was the future. He had the only car in detriot.
- Henry Ford's Decision: Bet on Himself and His Automobile
  Key takeaways:
  - Henry Ford had the foresight to invest in the internal combustion engine despite the overwhelming focus on electricity at the time
  - It is difficult to think for oneself when everyone else is focused on something else
  - Making a bet on oneself can lead to success, even when the odds are against you
  - Henry Ford had to choose between his job and his passion for automobiles, and he chose the latter
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I can still hear him saying, electricity, yes, that is the coming thing, but gas, no. And this is ford's point memein 18 92, maybe 18 93, at this point, no one had the remotest notion of the future of the internal combustion engine, while we were just on the edge of the great Electrical development. So everything, like all the energy, the attention, the money, the antrpanura, energy and spirit, is going into electricity. And yet, ford was able to ignore that distraction and with great independence of mind, no, i'm going, i'm going to focus on this thing because i'm i like it. I'm interested in it. I think it has a future. That is so that's easy to say, oh yes, think for yourself. It is almost impossible to actually do, especially when everybody around you is focused on something else. And this is where henry ford. At every there's always like a fork in the road. In an urch printer or founder's light fright. It's like at some point none of this is going to work if you don't bet on yourself. And usually you're not in the best position when you have to make this decision, which is why so few people do it. The edison company offered me the general superintendency of the company, but on condition that i would give up my gas engine and devote myself to something useful. That's their words. I had to choose between my job and my automobile, and i chose my automobile. This is a crazy thing, right? ([Time 0:40:09](https://share.snipd.com/snip/cba10491-0def-4a2f-89f4-3c940b359b46))
    - **Note:** He’s offered a raise and leadership position if he studies electric and gives up studying has motors in his free time. Crossroads in his life. Ford didn’t have a choice he had to quit and believes he was bound for success despite there never being a commercially successful car company. He was building a new industry and was dead broke. His wife supported his decision. He started a the detriot motor company who only made cars to order and folded then he started his own company to make cars for the every man bud realized he needed to gain a foothold in the market so he started by making racecars. Same marketing plan as Ferrari. His initial traction came from his success on the track. Service to the customer above everything he was being very successful selling racecars wasn’t enough he needed to serve the every man. To grow is success life isn’t a location but not a journey. He believed in constant hard work and never giving up. He used the 999 to jump start funding for his company. He would eventually buy back stock to get control. He was obsessed with taking weight out and simplifying the product without waste. Humans like to add complexity but he believed in deep beauty from simplicity. He didn’t build for pleasure but utility.
- Henry Ford's Progress Towards His Vision
  Key takeaways:
  - The speaker discusses how the increase in sales volume is bringing them closer to their original idea.
  - Some shareholders were concerned about the rapid growth of the company and wanted to stop the speaker from expanding production.
  - The speaker acknowledges the natural temptation to hold on to what one has and retire, but they personally never felt that urge.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Because once he got the price low enough, the goes from selling 15 hundred cars to almost 85 hundred. So it' fastening. Is like, even though there selling thousands and thousands of cars, he's getting closer to his original idea. Is not there yet. His other people, like the shareholders and other people on the business are lik o, this is good enough. But again, henry ford like, know, i just have one idea. I'm glad of the progress i'm making towards it. I think i'm geting closer, but i'm still not there yet. And so it says, we were a prosperous company, we might have easily sat down and said, now we've arrived, let us hold on to what we got. Indeed, there war some disposition to take this stand. Some of our stockholders were seriously alarmed when our production reached a hundred cars a day. They wanted to do something to stop me from ruining the company. And when i replied to the effect that 100 cars a day was only a trifle, and that i hoped long before to make a thousand a day, they were shocked. And he says, the temptation to stop and hang on to which to what one has, is quite natural. I can entirely sympathize with the desire to quit a life of activity and retire to a life of ease. I have never felt the urge myself. So at again, there's like a little bit of a ego. There's a gal they thought a hundred cards a day was fine. They thought a thousand cars a day was crazy. Hese like this, i understand it's very natural, you know, n to mess what you have. You know, i sympathize your desire to kind of take it easy, but that's not what im here. I have never felt the urge myself. ([Time 0:53:10](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d1e3ba98-8c0c-4653-8ba7-5510b3b51c08))
    - **Note:** The shareholders wanted him to take it easy and slow down. They thought 100 cats a day was enough but ford never wanted to slow down or stop only grow. He wanted to make 1000 cars a day there’s a reflex afyer success for shop growing and hold on but ford never felt that. All progress to him was an invitation to do more. Universal car was his goal he couldn’t stop until he got there. It would be high for Isley for both individuals and families but would be so low in price anyone could own one. He wanted to make a high quality cheap cars. Focus on continuous improvement and invention of the mass assembly car. He realized he could optimize everything. He really has one goal and the journey is him optimizing. He realized if he cut down a part by 10 feet he could cut down on 50 miles of walking a day. Constant steady improvement. No one is an expert if they truely know their job things only become impossible when you involve experts others understand that the world is complex and there is always more to learn. Would fire people once they thought they were experts because deep knowledge makes you aware of your ignorance. No one who deeply knows his job is an expert. Actively optimistic and believes nothing is impossible continuous improvement things can always done better.
- The Pursuit of Continuous Improvement and the Significance of Repetition in Organizational Culture
  Key takeaways:
  - Things can always be done better
  - Repetition is persuasive in the history of pinership
  - Never satisfied with the way things are done
  - Savings are calculated to the thousandth part of a cent
  - Competing with dhisgy is challenging
  - Studying history is like watching game tape of the greatest people
  - Not enough research into human nature
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Things can always be done better. He just says it with more words than he needs to. Not a single oeration is ever considered as being done in the best or cheapest way in our company. Things can always be done better. That is the idea behind that sentence. And so e main theme i the history on pinership is that repetition is persuasive. I've now moved like 20 pages ahead of where we just were, and he's still at it. We are never satisfied with the way that everything is done in any part of the organization. We always think that it ought to be done better, and that eventually it will be done better. And wh one cent saved on each part would amount to millions a year. Therefore, in comparing savings, the calculations are carried out to the thousandth part of a cent. That is how far he thinks he takes things. My improvements may be so miniscual that i cannot even calculate them unless i take out my calculations to the thousandth part of a cent. Imagine trying to compete with dhisgy. Then hiis a buch ar like one liners and maxim spread throughout the entire book. This one i love. Bcause essentially, when you're studying history, thts what you're doing. I ssik, i don't care what we think human nature is or it ought to be. It's like, what is it? We'll just read it. Like if you're reading these booksis like you're watching tape. Its like the same thing, the same way a basketball player watches tape, game taper, or any kind o athleat watches game tape. That's our reading biographie. We're just watching game tape of some of the greatest people in history, likew how they did, like fright? And he says there are far too many assumptions about what human nature ought to be, and not enough research into what it is. ([Time 0:59:39](https://share.snipd.com/snip/73827c2c-5aaa-4c9e-a167-9e7e7f4eb0f7))
    - **Note:** Too many assumptions about what human nature ought to be and not enough on what it is. There will never be a susyek that will get rid of work. Continuous improvement and less waste. Business is a process of give and take business is a river service to others. Reduction of price comes first no cost is fixed. Don’t confuse finance and business. Only bad businesses need money. Easy money is bad for business because it limits the true business you do. It gives you more money and you waste more time instead of fixing the business model. Business is problems in work clothes. Road to success is with mistakes we’ll handled. Business is creative problem solving. Believed in cheap products and high wages never forget you’re putting food on someone’s table but he needed people to produce or else they’d be fired. Invested ruthlessly in himself you need to invest money and do it in yourself. Maximum service at minimum cost was his model to business he bought a railroad and realized they invested heavily in admin stuff which was useless and not enough in machines and tech he took over and flipped that.
- The Efficiency of Reducing Time and Increasing Speed in Business
  Key takeaways:
  - Unnecessary accounting and red tape were eliminated, reducing the payroll from 2700 to 1650.
  - The speaker suggests that many businesses are overstaffed and lack skilled operators.
  - Increasing speed can lead to increased profitability by reducing time and increasing inventory turnover.
  - Routing freight over the speaker's own road ensures the best service and convenience.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And he just goes through and does this line by line. All these unnecessary a counting and red tape were thrown out. And the pay rol of the road was reduced from 27 hundred people down to 16 hundred and 50. And he goes on for quite a bit. I'm not going to read all that. I'm just going to give you what was my interpretation of what's taking place. Most businesses are overstaffed. The people running them are just not skilul operators. And so then he's like, ok, well, that you can there's is also way to increase money, is that you can actually reduce time. We are not pouring in greats amount of money. Everything is being done out of the earnings from the railroad. That is our policy. The time of our freight movements have been cut down about two thirds. And so he does that idea, the idea behind what that sens es ar there. He does that a lot. By increasing speed, he actually creates money. And theras very similar apple. Ah, that's one of the best things tim cook did at the very beginning, when when steve jobs came back to apple. And apple actually did this ecause the increased inventory turnover when steve came back ad it was, like, i forgot how much money saved, but it was agood amount. It was like tens of millions. It might even been like 200 millions. Was a good amount of money. Just like making things go faster. We are routing as much as we can around our own business over the road, but only because we we because on this road we get the best service. For years past, we ad been trying to send freight over this road that i now own, that i previously didn't, is what he's telling us, right? Because it was conveniently located. But we'd never been able to use it to any extent because of the delayed deliveries. ([Time 1:14:45](https://share.snipd.com/snip/893276f4-fecc-4ee4-9d38-3cc4977e25de))
    - **Note:** Most businesses are overstaffed and you need to fire people to cut down on staff to the right amount. You can cut costs to save money or you can save time which also saves money. Don’t throw money at incompetent people fix the systemic issue. Don’t fear the future or failure there is honor in failure as it helps future endeavors but there is no honor In refusing to try. Figure out ways to not make a lightbulb = failure. Competition is irrelevant the best deserves to win. Service before profit. Manufacturing isn’t buying low and selling high but buying reasonable and transforming with low excess cost into something useful. Every advance begins with the individual and it’s our mission to do something there is always something to do and we must do it.
