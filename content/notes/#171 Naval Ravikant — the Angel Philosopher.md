  Speaker 1
  Reality is I just read a lot that by today's standards would be considered mental junk food But eventually you just get to like reading you run out of a junk food and then you start eating the healthy food Right or your taste kind of gradually So I think to some extent That's what happened with me because I started from comic books and then went from that into mysteries and went from that into fantasy You guys to sci-fi and then from sci-fi made into science and then mathematics and then philosophy So it just kind of kept climbing up the stack But I'm lucky that there was no one around when I was seven years old or 16th old saying oh you shouldn't read that You should read this instead is most of what you read today physical or on a computer Kindle For convenience, it's mostly Kindle It's not the Kindle device. It sucks in an iPad And but for books that I really really like I will also buy a physical copy so I have books So there's no excuse not to read it You know a really good book cost ten or twenty dollars and you can change your life in a meaningful way So it's not something I believe in saving money on and this is even back when I was broken I had no money I always spend money on books. I never viewed that as an expense That's an investment to me and I probably spend 10 times as much money in books as I actually get through so in other words like for every $200 worth of books I buy actually end up making it to 10% So I'll read $20 worth of books, but it's still absolutely worth it. You and I have a common Yeah, and anything that's one of the greats like if I read a book and I know that it's amazing I'll buy multiple copies partially to give away partially because I have the money around the house And these days I find myself rereading as much or more as I do reading Because I I think this was a tweet from an account on On Twitter that I saw this guy ill assertus and he basically said, you know I don't want to read everything I just want to read the 100 great books over and over again, and I think there's a lot to that So it's really more about identifying what are the great books to you because different books speak to different people And then really absorbing those because I don't know about you, but I don't I have very poor ([Time 0:08:19](https://share.snipd.com/snip/07253d67-c198-4d6d-a7d9-6d53305756e2))
    - **Note:** The importance of an anti library. Books are $20 but can pay off millions. Not an expense but an investment.
- Breaking the Habit of Uncontrolled Thinking
  Key takeaways:
  - One important takeaway is the challenge of breaking the habit of uncontrolled thinking, which can be difficult as it often involves a paradoxical effect of trying to avoid certain thoughts.
  - Another takeaway is the importance of guided experiences, states of mind, locations, and activities that can help individuals escape their own minds and achieve a more present-focused reality.
  - Additionally, the speaker emphasizes the desire to weaken and mute the sense of self, rather than allowing it to develop and become stronger over time.
  - Lastly, the passage highlights the value of accepting and appreciating the world as it is, rather than seeking happiness solely through external circumstances or preconceived notions.

  Speaker 1
  So I've taken on this idea that I want to break the habit of uncontrolled thinking Which is hard because if I say to you don't think of a pink elephant. I just put a pink elephant in your head So it's it's it's an almost impossible problem. So it's more something that has to be guided by feel Then guided by actual thinking or thought process But I'm deliberately cultivating Experiences states of mind locations activities that will help me get out of my mind And I know you know all society does that to some extent in some sense the the People chasing thrills and action sports or flow states or Orgads or any of these states that people really strive to get to a lot of these are Basically just trying to get out of your own head They're trying to get away from that voice in your head and this overdeveloped sense of self at the very least I do not want my sense of self to continue to develop and become stronger as I get older I want it to be weaker and more muted So that I can live much more in Present everyday reality and accept nature in the world for what it is And appreciate it very much in the childhood and then not have to seek Happiness through external circumstances chasing to fit some preconceived notion that I have Why there's a lot that I want to ask questions on is there. ([Time 0:24:23](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8d7cf7e7-9ad8-4acc-916b-7889864de7d5))
    - **Note:** Getting out of your own head stop chasing highs and living in your head. Live in the present. Happiness is there when you remove desire and what’s missing in your life. Contentment. When you transcend desire and stop seeing life as a comparison and appreciate it for what it is you’re getting closer to happiness. Neutral state and seeing the world as it is and living in nature controlling your internal monologue. We don’t live enough in our bodies and too much in our heads.

  Speaker 1
  This is a way of life And I'm not going to compromise on it. I'm going to stay this way forever Uh, I just don't want to live life any other way Um, now I've never fully enumerated them, but you know examples of them like I think honesty is a core core core value Um to be to give you examples of what I mean by honesty is I want to be able to just be me I don't want to I never want to be in an environment around people where I have to watch what I say Because if I disconnect what I'm thinking from what I'm saying that creates multiple threads in my mind Uh, that means that I'm no longer in the moment That means that I now have to work the future planning or past regretting every time i'm talking to somebody So, um, anyone around whom I can't be fully honest. I don't want to be around Um, uh, another example of a foundational value is Uh, I don't believe in any short-term thinking or dealing So if I see anybody who's even around me Uh, like let's say I'm doing business with somebody and they think in a short-term manner with somebody else Then I don't want to do business without person anymore Because I think all the benefits in life come from compound interest whether in money or in relationships or love or health or activities or habits So I only want to be around people that I know i'm going to be around with for the rest of my life Uh, and I only want to work on things that I know have the long-term Uh payout Another one is like I only believe in pure relationships. I don't believe in a hierarchical relationship So I don't want to be above anybody and I don't want to be below anybody If I can't treat someone like a peer and if they can't treat me like a peer then we have them I just don't want to interact with that human Um, another one is I don't believe in anger anymore I mean that was something that was good when I was young and full of testosterone But now I always like the Buddha saying that anger is a hot cold that she holds in her hand while waiting To throw it at somebody So, you know, I don't want to be angry and I don't want to be around angry people So I just cut them out of my life Um, and I'm not judging them I mean I I went through a lot of anger too And so, you know, they have to work through it on their own but go be angry at someone else somewhere else Um, so I don't know if that necessarily falls into the classical definition of value But it's a set of things that I won't compromise on Uh, and that I just lived my entire life by And I think everybody has values and a lot of finding great relationships, great co-workers, great lovers Uh, wives, husbands is finding other people where your values just line up And then the little things don't matter Generally I find that if people are fighting or quarreling about something, it's because their values don't line up Because their values lined up, the little thing wouldn't matter How is radical honesty? ([Time 0:41:21](https://share.snipd.com/snip/784406c2-2882-466c-af6f-e6dfe1b890e5))
    - **Note:** Be radically honest and hang out with peoples who’s values are aligned. Don’t lie to others or yourself. Praise specifically criticize generally. Find your foundational values early and evolve that definition over time. He started with a freedom to do things and now he’s looking for freedom from reaction and anger. What people struggle with is controlling your internal state and meditation helps you observe your mental state.
- The Importance of Playing the Single Player Game

  Speaker 1
  All right. What does that do? It just you you're you calm down You're the emotions subside the hormones go down and your mental student a better mental state 24 hours later So I think people already know this Um, but we just don't act on it because socially We're not conditioned to act on it. Socially. We're told go work out go look good Because that's a multiplayer competitive game. Other people can see if i'm doing a good job or not Or we're told go make money Go buy a big house again external multiplayer competitive game. But when it comes to Uh, learn to be happy train yourself to be happy completely internal No external progress. No external validation 100% you're competing against yourself single player again Uh, and we're such social creatures. We're more like bees or ants that we're externally programmed and driven Uh that we just don't know how to play and win at these single player games anymore We compete purely on multiplayer games. But the reality is life is a single player game You're born alone. You can die alone. All your interpretations are alone. All your memories are alone And you're gone three generations. Nobody cares before you showed up. Nobody cared.
  Speaker 2
  It's all single player I think bafat has a great example of that when he gives the do you want to be ([Time 0:52:35](https://share.snipd.com/snip/39eb8d13-9c9b-4531-bc91-874fcf1b0ac4))
    - **Note:** Don’t play for mimetic reasons and go with the herd but do something for genuine thick desires not thin ones. Build systems don’t pursue goals. Life is a single player game have an internal scorecard. People don’t transcend as a group only individuals. Find your unique point of differentiation. Easy choices hard life hard choices easy life. Doing the right thing and being a good person is wrong in the short term but right in the long term. Any good idea or concept is simple. If you can’t distill something simply and clearly you don’t understand it. Embrace reality as it is not as yiu want it to be. Success requires intense commitment over decades in an area you love not get rich quick and with the right dedication intelligence and mindset the right people win over the long term. Make falsifiable theories and predictions. Don’t look for happiness through outside desires make sure all your happiness and goals are internal because externals are fickle. You need to embed meaning into your life.
