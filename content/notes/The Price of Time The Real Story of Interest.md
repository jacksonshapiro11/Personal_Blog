### Highlights

- The central bankers are slowly taking over the world. In Europe they say it’s a liquidity issue but it’s not. They think credit is too important to be left to the market high modernist approach of bankers. They are willing to get rid of anything that gets in their way not giving aid when elections don’t go in their favor and getting rid of cash so they have more control of a cashless society. They want to control it all. Central planning doesn’t work as well as the market and the state wants more control so they take leaving problems for everyone else. Need to get a grasp on central planning. Can’t allow it. The more we seek security the less risk we take and the more backwards we go. Security is granted to some as a privilege but to the underprivileged they rely on that security. Their lives are worse. Independence goes down. Middle class is vital or we will have an oligarchy and lose a democracy. Capitalism is under threat from intellectuals who have never worked for anything in their life and don’t realize they were built on the success of it and turning it off stagnates the world. The intellectuals love the higher standard of living hate the insecurity you must have both. Elites have no responsibility for their affairs but many opinions. Low rates have done to the market what socialism couldn’t creating world wide central planning due to those in charge directing capital flows through lower rate. Weber backed into terrible socialism. Central banker created socialism. Allow rates to rise to restore savings and stabilize after a depression. Central bankers must see the world as a complex adaptive system and stay humble.
- In China they kept rates low to fuel growth and kept funding bad debt but then nationalizing it and kept capital onshore when it tried to leave the country they extradited the people leaving. This can’t last forever eventually it’ll pop and it will be very bad. Low rates led to chinas inequality to double with corruption very high. China inequality got so high the state stopped publishing the stats which were likely understated as is so much worse. Free money led to flight away from the people which led to more nationalization and surveillance where we are now but bad investment eventually comes due. State capitalism is being used across the world to keep rates low.
- Low rates led people to borrow dollars to buy foreign assets with higher rates leading to a carry trade everywhere which created toxic leverage everywhere. Easy money fueled toxic leverage and cheap capital everywhere creating an everything bubble that led every country to be over levered with lower spreads than they should’ve had. The longer the bubble the bigger the crash also led to currency collapse. This also led to commodity price inflation because cash values went to 0. When the free money slowed and the fed tappered all the emerging markets collapsed. They needed free money to continued to survive. Once this stopped these collapsed. Low interest rates led turkey to have demand then they took on too much debt and when rates went up they collapsed. Low rates in the us crashed turkeys economy and destabilized the lira. Fueled rising inflation. Globalism led to lower interest rates and lower labor costs. Cheap capital fueled foreign manufacturing build outs giving investors returns and hollowing out the middle class. All bubbles are built on globalization which either succeeds or pops and causes chaos. Financial suppression stimulates credit growth which hurt the savings rates. When rates are too low shadow banking and unstable bubbles are created. When money is cheap crazy things get built regardless of its use. Whenever people lend too much and things get out of control and rates are kept artificially low problems are created in the economy.
- The late 2010s was an everything bubble enabled by low rates. The profits and financialization of the economy increased but not productivity. This created an asset prices bubble and loss in manufacturing capacity. He compared the Truman show to our bubble economy fake world fake risk everything manufactured. Bubbles inflate and deflate but no real risk the entire economy is fake. Time presence is the personal rate of interest. Saving for the future and compounding time is a way to enable growth. Low interest rates distort this creating problems. Low rates leave no chance of wealth accumulation so they save instead of spend. Wealth effect led to lower savings leaving pretty much everyone worse off. Low rates are good in short run but not in the long run where it creates more problems. Further this created massive pension issues. This is driving a massive issue people retiring without savings. Low interest rates creates inequality. Fed created wealth bubble through low rates. Low rates encourage risk taking.
- The cheap money leads to consolation of industry through trusts and value extraction not creation. Concentration is an effect of low rates and hurts innovation while extracting profits for owners. The buyout firms extracted capital without improving operations using low rates. Profits are a measure of company value but shareholder value focus has led to focusing on extracting value instead of creating it led to bad growth but good returns. American firms spent money on buybacks instead of investing in growth. Buybacks are not good but were enabled by low rates. Over financialization hurts growth and was created by low rates. Companies extract not create and hurts everyone. Companies like GE over financialized and collapsed as a result.
- Interest is good because it turns time into the cost of production. Interest rations capital very well. Interest guides, the industry entrepreneur, and means of production the allocate capital efficiently. Proper interest rates stabilize the market. The great depression was a moment where capital went from abundant the scares, and it weeded out the bad operators and sharpen the market. It made so many car companies got business, but the ones that stayed in business were so much stronger for it. Recessions enable creative destruction. they have a cleansing effect they needed the more tough times the better products are. Without these cycles zombies are created and get more capital so it’s just inefficient allocation of capital which leads to less actual growth. This is the issue with profits. The inability to cut rates, forcing countries to innovate as led to long stained stagnation in Europe. This is the same for unicorns which through cheap has funded bad businesses of all struggled. the shows that low rates doesn’t help efficient capital allocation but destroys it. Cost of capital was too low. Low rates killed productivity. Monetary policy is why the country didn’t grow. No ability to cleanse and ceos getting paid in stock issued debt to buy back stocks instead of investing in growth. Low rates hurt growth because money goes to bad capital allocators. The fed is like the fire service. They don’t let small fires kill the bad trees so the kindling build up kills everything. The inability for the fed to accept vol and panics leads to a worse economy and toxic leverage much like the fire errors cause and this lingers forever.
- No real factor can explain interest rates only monetary factors. The neglecting of monetary factors in the economy is a massive failing of central bankers too much dogma and religion. Influence of monetary policy dictates rates more than anything else. The signaling of rate stability kept rates stability but this doesn’t mean natural stability can mean fluctuating think system stocks where stability is actually fragility. When the fed steps in it destabilizes the market. This also leads to keeping bad debt and those staying around and a reach for yield so more bad debts. You need to both lower and raise rates in balance to keep economy stable. Stagnation is a modern monetary theory.
- Volcker targeted rate stabilization. Easy money creates excess and fragility in the economy. This is never the right answer and the bill will always come due. Volcker killed so many us businesses through high rates people tried to kill him then every banker after him got to lower rates to prop up the economy and fuel a bull market everywhere because of his reset which was enabled by getting the us off the gold standard. Bretton woods led to low rates completely changed the world. From the 1990s until today we have cut rates to prop up the economy leading to fragility. Easy money was what caused the crisis not bad regulation. Easy money led to reach for yields. Inflation targets don’t work. Price stability is bad. Targeting is the definition of goodharts law. Anything we target in the economy becomes unimportant because it gets surpassed as useful. Inflation targeting had so many issues that made it useless. Low rates didn’t allow the economy to be cleaned out. Led to bad excess. Need purging. They argue against secular stagnation say it’s a bs reason to argue against growth and overall false. It was made after the depression and proved wrong and these population dynamic arguments generally prove wrong. The arguement that excess savings was also not backed up by the data. Demographic investment and savings don’t explain lack of real growth it’s really monetary things that bankers can’t admit to themselves. Easy money is what causes issues. Ultra low rates hurts growth.
- The Austrian economists understood interest better and performed much better during the depression. The Austrians believed there was a natural rate it could be derived and prices should fluctuate. Hayek said that while prices were stabilized much of that was hidden and it basically destabilized the value of money instead of stabilizing price. Credit inflation is a sign of wider inflation even if it doesn’t show in pricing. This is basically a massive warning against low rates which repeated during Covid. Bernanke said the Great Depression was because of restrictive rates not the knock on effects of lower rates. Bernanke believed the depression was the result of too tight a monetary policy not the issues before that. He’s wrong but this is why he cut rates he didn’t understand the situation. Debt deflation is painful but natural and avoiding that natural cleansing is vital to long term health avoiding creates more fragility.
- Previously rates were determined by gold flows but now when they made gold exchangeable rates could be set and monetary policy became a thing it wasn’t just a simple output. Countries could finally conduct an active monetary policy to change rates to achieve a certain end but this became politicized quickly. The fed thought their goal was now to balance inflation and unemployment to stabilize prices. People wanted to reduce discount rates. But monetary policy was so loose that it led to a market boom but created fragility in the system. Don’t have loose policy in good times because when the bad times inevitably come it’s a disaster. The fed believed they had tamed interest and speculation was natural. Believes they shouldn’t regulate that they fueled a 37% s&p return in one year. Andrew Mellon declared the end of cycles. Everything was under control except it wasn’t. This low interest rates created a bubble because the future was discounted too much. Money that flowed abroad was being spent on us exports and the money people were spending was from investment income not their job so economy was proped up on investment success which was on lower rates then the bubble popped it all collapsed. Federal bankers met in Long Island us bankers wanted to keep rates low while France wanted a true rate. These low rates spured a ww1 recovery. Fed then cut rates again which basically set the us for failure. Hayek said the inflation of credit won’t solve europes problems. Then the fed lowered rates and bought more. Hoover wanted the free money. Strong who was the head of the fed got sick and died fed started to restrict policy created a vacuum with all capital going to the us. Stock market first half of year was up 30% but eventually everyone raised rates and it all collapsed. All the bankers were thrown into depressions or mental panics. Banks collapsed and this slowly made its way through the financial system popping every bubble everywhere starting the depression. Shows how the economy is a complex system. Keynes didn’t believe the crash would ever come and was buying more during the depression. Economists all failed to understand economy and lost so much money.
- John law and the Mississippi company profited from low rates which led people to discount and bring the future closer. He took control of the central bank and started printing money for shares. Eventually this collapsed and the value of the enterprise fell 90%. Created deflation to prevent collapse. In low rates people pull forward the future. Printing money leads first to financial asset inflation then real inflation once the money exits the financial system. Central bankers are taking on laws system now of money printing which will lead you to failure. They’re praising his ideas saying there wasn’t a bubble when money printing and artificially low rates help inflates assets for a period of time before an inevitable collapse. Credit cycle when rates get lower people become more wreckless and go further out on the risk curve. Monetary policy can’t just be money printing. Low rates lead to speculation. Banks should be cautious. Brittish panic of 1825 established how people take excess risk in low rates and the Bank of England became the lender of last resort. When money becomes too cheap people take crazy risk. This is seen as the 2% threshold. Everytime there are low rates people think it’s due to good managers leads to a cycle excess investment like railroads then collapse. People can’t stand low returns. Collapse doesn’t destroy capital just reveal the bad loans that were already made. The new bankers changes the old rules of lender of last resort who stepped in for short periods lending at high rates by stepping in indefinitely at low rates. People chase a high yield not worrying if that yield will be realized. Overall becomes a crazy environment.
- Time preference is inherent in all human actions. Impossible to abolish interest positive desire to have things now means interest can never be negative. Tvom is at the heart of all valuation. Anticipation is always at a discount. Capital value and interest have an inverse relationship. When interest goes down prices go up. When rates decline people push investment further in the future longer term projects. When interest rate isn’t correct then things get funded that should’ve never been funded in the first place if too low of things that shouldn’t happen happen. Creates malinvestment and too much leverage. Too much malinvestment leads to crisis. Once interest was made legal people started believing interest should be as low as possible to spur investment. Lower interest would help the economy. Low interest doesn’t increase wealth but just hurts lenders. Interest rates only go down because wealth is being created or is plentiful not the other way. Natural rate of interest is governed by the rate of trade and desire for money. Interested function of the supply and demand for money. When interest is too from the natural rate or too low it leads to a boom that is unnatural and unstable. Leah’s to inflation of deflation. Easy money doesn’t lead to extra output just misallocation. Value of capital is relative to the rate of interest. When the Mississippi company started to struggle the government tried to ban the trade of precious metal and restrict cash to prop up the economy. They were trying to steal property.
- Interest was a way to incentivize lending because there was always a time delta between money being lent and paid. Interest was seen as a mirror to the real world as you could either hold productive assets or interest bearing notes on these assets. Interests have always been prevalent because money has always been scarce so there is a desire to have cash because it’s not evenly distributed. Interest exists because loans have value and lending is risky. Lending historically was seen as usury and done to put people into slavery through debt bondage people who lent money were seen as very low status. Double entry book keeping helped merchants in Italy quantify time better and they found ways around church lending rules at such a high rate the church basically got rid of the lending laws. Time had value and was an Individuals property was accepted and this made the idea of lending with interest accepted why shouldn’t they get compensated for risk and lost profits usury was made legal in 1571. It became accepted that loaning money was good for production personal loans were still not viewed well and many religious or other scholars saw that people deserved a reward for taking that risk. Interest is the price of time not money. People started to see money as capital and integral to making the system run. Capital consists of stream of future income discounted this became this main idea starting in1700s without capital no capitalism. Capital is a dealer in a vital commodity that must be lent out within the correct risk framework creates the most productive Resource use and EV for society. Instegsrotes of capitalism were sellers of time. Interest is the difference in monetary value between time tvom. Deferred gratification. People like rewards now. So delaying is bad. Needs like youth and hunger usually want money now.
- Interest is 5k years old and older than money which was invented 3k years ago. Many of the words refer to animals or seeds where you’d gift some animal or seed and get back more than you gifted ie interest. Both men and women lent at interest for everything from food to rent and created credit networks going back to 1800bc. Borrowing and lending inmate to humans. A wide variety of loans were made to influence how things were done back then. Debt jubilees date back to ancient times where every so often consumer credit was forgiven sometimes at the start of a new ruler so debt didn’t compound out of control. Hammurabi set out standard rates for silver 20% Apr and barely 33% but payday lenders figured out shorter term structure to juice apys. However historically rates were stable and didn’t change why do they now? These were determined by custom. Rates did fluctuate by risk profile and were expongable with force manjure like a ship sinking. When Augustus brought a ton of gold back interest rates fell when the next emperor had a tight policy they rose. Tiberius to end tight money gave to rich families interest free first example of QE this only really helped the rich. So there was law and custom as well as market dynamics that determined interest. Interest is lower when geopolitical risk is lower and higher likewise with the opposite
