### Highlights

- How do you find what you believe in and what your skills and abilities predispose you to do.
  Fox vs hedgehog - the fox is fast slick and beautiful the hedgehog is unfashionable. Foxes are social and great at fundraising hedgehogs are more introverted. Hedgehogs are focused and naturally curious. Stay in one company forever instead of jumping from company to company. Hedgehog start something new keep their path and inspire people to follow along with them.
  To make a decision is to cut out all other paths.
  Combined east coast mindset and west coach tech mindset and merges the old old and the new new way of doing things. Values of old vigors of the new.
  Sydney had soul in the game.
  A leader exercises judgement instead of fitting the facts to a predetermined conclusion.

    - **Note:** Follow what gives you energy and what your skills predispose you to.
      Fox vs hedgehog going very wide vs deep. Soul in the game leading from the front. Keep vs limit optionality. Optionality vs focus
      Leader must take agency make judgements. When you decide you cut off many paths it’s more pruning possible states of the world.
- Management as the jazz quartet. Everyone has their own skills but they need to improvise and play off each other.
  Recklessness vs daring- conscious decision to go forward after understanding the risks and rewards of going forward.
  Nimbleness willing to challenge orthodoxy based on first principles thinking. Gates pivoting to the internet was nimbleness and buffet rejecting the internet were both nimble one was not chasing what he didn’t know the other saw his company under threat and realized he needed to pivot. This is daring. Sydney did this twice in his business pivoting completely for a new technology he saw as revolutionary. Doing this jump started his company and gave him a headstart on the competition that lasts decades. Disrupt yourself long term thinking.

    - **Note:** I’m change you need to consider who’s best to address it and move to do that. Bill gates saw the internet as this big disruptor for his business that was existential but buffet saw it as outside his circle of competence both men made the right decision because failure was on the other side of chasing or dogmatism
      Be daring intelligent risk for reckless unintelligent risk.
      Management like a jazz quartet constantly playing to peoples strengths
- Saw the need to have systems thinkers as founders who understand the entire business and how it all fits together. Don’t need business school specialists but liberal arts generalists.
  Leader must lead from the front and lead by example.
  Work uninterrupted through the day and usually leaves after everyone. He ends up getting divorced because he was so work focused. He works out every day. He’s fully engaged mentally. Eats small meals
  Accept business unorthodoxy critically.
  Be confident when you go into a job interview you might be terrified but the other guy is probably terrified. If you’re scared they’re scared and take comfort in that and have a strong self confidence.

    - **Note:** Wanted founders to be systems thinkers who saw the entire picture generalists. Leads from the front deeply focused on his job leads to a divorce. Fully mentally focused a deep sense of self confidence
- He gets all his ideas from talking with customers. Opposite of jobs.
  Find mentors in your field.
  He developed a new product in his first field by studying all the competing products and realizing he differentiated by having a simplified user interface one control vs many.
  He worked at another company for 12 years and realized he needed to go out in his own but this background helped him launch his new company and this daring chance changed his life he launched with 10k total.
  The people they challenged were incumbents who were not nimble enough for their start up mentality. They were dinosaurs who were already dead.
  Doing their demo - at a trade show everyone had peg boards where they played classical music to show the audio quality Harmon set up a living room and played the most famous artist at the time frank sinatra so people would have a clear and direct comp. Actually thinking about product customer experience.

    - **Note:** Talked and listened to customers had a unique marketing strategy. Classic disruption of incumbents. Went out on his own risking everything giving people the product they wants. Start up mentality. Made the product simpler.
- Hard work is a prerequisite. Hard work persistence and determination doesn’t guarantee success but it increases the odds. Get up early and fight to improve the odds.
  Harmon karden developed a cult following. Develop a cult belief in your product.
  He agrees to a merger but this leaves him to leave the company because mavericks need control. He creates a buy out agreement where either side could buy the other out but both named the price. Harmon underestimated his business partner and lost his company. The lack of control lead to head butting which lead to the loss of his company
  He then just started a new company getting involved in a conglomerate. He believed in small over big acquisitions.
  He had to sell his company because we was asked to serve for a president. He sells it to a conglomerate of consultants who didn’t understand the business blew it up and he bought it back for half the price. Business types.

    - **Note:** hardwork is a prerequisite it doesn't guarantee success but ups the odds. Developing a cult like following is a statistically advantage. This is also a good lesson in keeping control of your business some people cannot work for other and some people like consultants cannot run businesses
- Ethics is vital you need it or else it falls apart in your business and with others.
  Man carving a horse he isn’t making something he’s just getting rid of everything that isn’t horse.
  He realized digital was a revolution and realigned his business. Now his business is all digital. You need to make big bets and ride the wave.
  Running a business is not like running a candy story. You don’t clock in and out you need a plan and moral compass. You can’t just open and close it’s a life.
  Leader defines the company, a leader inspires, leader must be an evangelist and must see the company as a whole. Systems thinking. Never doubt the importance of disciplined hard work. The harder you work the luckier you get. When the moment is right get it done.
  Know what you don’t know accept you can be out if your depth. If you’re unclear ask for clarification.

    - **Note:** Ethics are vital work with people you trust. Sculpting vs painting. Riding the wave of technology. Agency and ownership in business. Founder with 10k lives soul of the company. See the system of the company and admit your ignorance that's when learning starts. Luck favors the prepared mind
- Respect people and their time.
  Leaders are teacher and catalysts.
  Business is the unique expression of you as a person.
  He is a lifelong learner and reader. Made a college where every student was responsible for their education and teachers were guides. Teacher is a resource not a fountain. This forced students to build their own curriculum.
  Being fully engaged in his work.
  When you get people to break it down and simplify the situation it leads to more not less benefits. Be willing to break it down. If he doesn’t understand it he’ll do the work to understand it or pass.

    - **Note:** Respect others and their time, break things down to first principles. Lifelong learning, taking control of your curriculum and focusing on your unique differentiation.
- He acquired smaller companies and grows them not big ones that need financial engineering. Knew there was room for financial engineering but that’s not the business that he was having you need to know your key points of differentiation. Know what business you’re in. Apple doesn’t make computers but tools for creative minds. Jet blue is in the business of facilitating your life through transportation.
  Actions express priority thought marketing was very important. Much like Steve Jobs. Wanted a customer for life didn’t want to optimize for the short term. Wanted to court and value their customer. His early ads would celebrate great musicians. Nike selling great athletes. Apple selling visionaries.
  Develop an inner compass. And adjust your life wiry this compass in mind.
  Don’t come to an interview unprepared. Do your home work.
  Document your journey. When you’re done you’ll want it.

      Marketing is an investment not a cost.

      Customer focused with long term relationships wanted a customer for life and built his relationships that way.
      Enjoy the moment document your journey. Inner locus of control. Failing to prepare is preparing to fail. Understand your customer and cultivate the relationships you want. You get what you deserve customers business ect.
