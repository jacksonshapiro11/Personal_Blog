  It says, Jerry Jones doesn't like to waste time. On the rare occasion he hits the golf course, he's been known to close a business deal by the first hole, shake hands, and then walk off saying, why would I play another four hours when The deal was done? Tales abound of 4 a.m. Phone calls from Jones, leaving those on the other end unsure if he's just waking up or he hasn't slept yet. That is a reoccurring theme throughout the entire book, that the fact that he pushes himself, he's one of the most driven people I ever meet, and he has the ability to survive and thrive On very, very limited sleep. So in this case, he's not waking up at 4 a.m. He hasn't gone to bed yet. Such restless energy and single-minded drive has defined Jerry Jones for decades. You talk about the fact that he's this collection, his persona is part high-stakes entrepreneur, which is really the amount of risk this guy takes is just absolutely incredible. We'll talk a lot about that today. Partner, part football evangelist and part showman. He's definitely got like a PT Barnum, shown showmanship, very gifted storyteller raconteur to him.

- Both are energetic, visionary, charismatic leaders with unconventional thinking and a penchant for strategic risk-taking. Extreme self confidence to act on ideas and great salesmen. In the 1960s he tried and failed so much. He is in debt out his ass. The only thing that saves him is he’s nice to an old lady and gets back to the bank so they don’t foreclose on his property. 500k loan now worth 20mm. Dad sells business. Jerry gets 500k put it into an oil venture no one believes in. His life is basically things shouldn’t have worked out but they did. So many people turn this down Jerry says yes they drill a successful well in each of the first 15. Jerry wanted to get rich and took on a ton of risk to do that. Then when they made it big they partied hard. He has never met a high risk deal he didn’t like. You have to be a gambler to play in the oil business and can’t let failure crush you but if you get too full of yourself you’ll fail. Then he gets into natural gas after oil.

  I'm going to read the parts. Almost this entire outline is Jerry Jones. So I'm describing Ted Turner, but really it is, it gives you an overview of who Jerry Jones is, especially when he's young in his career where we're at in the story right now. Key characteristics, number one, boundless energy and intensity. Okay. Known for nonstop talking and nervous energy. He cannot sit still, needs constant movement and activity. This sounds like Jerry Jones to me. Worked incredibly long hours, often sleeping in his office. Okay. Number two, extraordinary vision and belief had absolute conviction in his ideas. This is again, still about Ted Turner. Wait till we get to the massive bets, these huge, risky bets that Jerry Jones placed in his life had absolute. And why would you do that? Because you have absolute conviction and ideas. And Ted Turner's case, particularly about the future of cable TV, was willing to be early and made bold prediction, had an obsessive work ethic, live by the mottos, early to bed, early To rise, work like hell, and advertise. He would consistently be the first to arrive and the last to leave. He pushed himself and his organizations relentlessly. Again, still about Ted Turner. It's the same person. We're describing the same exact personality type. Complex personal background, deeply impacted by childhood experiences and the relationship with his father. Developed a fear of abandonment and the need for constant companionship. Struggled with personal relationships despite business success. Also, at the same time, they were both charismatic leaders. They had incredibly enthusiastic and infectious personalities. They could be incredibly persuasive one-on Jerry Jones is one of the best salespeople you could ever read about. They were both known for thinking unconventionally and making themselves unforgettable. Strategic risk taker, willing to bet big on their convictions, often competed against much larger companies and had more commitment and desire than their competitors. And then finally, this extreme level of self-confidence to act on their beliefs, extremely self-assured, not afraid to challenge industry giants, and believe strongly in their Ability to succeed. It is remarkable how much of just like what I remember reading about Ted Turner, like really just jumped out at me as I was going through this biography of Jerry Jones. Now, when we move into his early life and his early career, you see this like relentless drive also produces like frantic energy. He was, he had this deep burning desire to get rich and he wanted to get rich and go into football. ([Time 0:23:37](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d94071f1-3d25-4cef-8bdc-9fed44ef550c))
- After an initial setback ruining a well, Jones and McCoy invested another $500,000 and drilled again 100 feet away. This resulted in a natural gas well worth over $40 million, and a similar success story unfolded with their San Francisco well, ultimately making them $80 million. Running through failure. Jones works out a deal with the oil and gas company to sell product at a specific price well above market. This great deal leads to that company having to buy out Jerry. He makes 300mm on this venture. Every hole but one he drilled was successful incredibly lucky. Jerry had wanted to own a football team forever. Would go over his plans if he ever bought one with his college roommate jimmy johmson. The current owner uses the team as a depreciation asset and only ever went to 2 games. Runs it poorly losing 9mm can’t sell seats. Jerry loves football. He was told buying the cowboys was a terrible idea he takes all the money in the bank to do it. 75 people turned it down. His edge is he’s completely obsessed. He found the game he wanted to play and was obsessed with being successful. Find the people who love any field because they’ll work much harder.

  You made a mistake, that's fine. You get up and you drill again. This is exactly what they did. The partners invested another $500,000. They moved the drill bit 100 feet. The next day they learned they had hit a natural gas well worth over $40 million. The same time they're drilling in San Francisco. The first reports from the well near San Francisco were not good. The guy running the job for them out there called and said we had turned up nothing. Then he called back eight hours later and said we're going to be rich. The well outside of San Francisco would produce $40 million worth of gas over a two year period. Jones and McCoy had made $80 million on their first two natural gas wells. The crazy stories in this book continue. This is one of the biggest, I think this might be the biggest deal he does. This next story is the biggest deal he does before he buys the Dallas Cowboys. It is also the hardest to explain and the one that he has the most controversy over. So Jerry has a friend, this guy named Sheffield Nelson. Sheffield Nelson was CEO of Arkansas, Louisiana Gas Company, which is a state regulated utility company. Before Nelson was CEO of the utility company, him and Jones had been friends for almost a decade. They owned ([Time 0:38:21](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c27fec8b-a451-42e7-8840-995c9dceb1ac))
- His obsession fuels his relentless work ethic, exceeding previous owners who lacked genuine football interest. Jones's intensity is palpable, driving him to build not just a winning team but a successful football company. Described as "a little crazy" by Don Tyson, Jones possesses a dual personality: a charming storyteller and a tough businessman. This complexity makes him difficult to read, and he approaches every project with unwavering self-belief. He was a missionary with the football team. He was very intense. He runs into every project believing he can be success. He believes life is hard work. Team is poorly run when he takes over he rethinks the business.

  It is obvious. People say, oh, there's like all these people criticizing Jerry Jones in the book. He's just doing this for money. He wants to make a lot of money, but you can clearly tell he's not doing this for money because 30 years after this book was published, he still owns the Dallas Cowboys. He's obsessed with owning a football team and running a football team. And you just clearly see this. And as a result of this obsession, he's going to work so much harder at this than the previous owner did, who wasn't really interested in football. He's like, oh, this is great. This is a way I can, you know, offset some taxes for my oil business. Where Jerry's like, no, I'm going to build the best football, not only football organization he's trying to win on the field, but also a football company. He really invents a lot of ideas that are used throughout sports that, to you and I, looking back 30 years later, they weren't doing this back then? It just seems so obvious. So again, just one of his superpowers. Jerry can sell, sell, sell. He was selling since he was a nine-year greeting customers at his family's supermarket. In college, he sold shoes from the trunk of his car. He would make up to $700 selling student tickets before his college football games. So he buys a team and he immediately, just like we said that he has in common with Ted Turner, it's like, I'm going to blaze my own path. I'm going to run the business, not how it used to be run, how you think I should run it, how I want to run it. Immediately takes over the team and then turns the entire staff over. There's a bunch of detail in the book, but I think this one sentence gives you an idea of what he does. It says he took a wrecking ball to the past. And so we see immediately these reoccurring personality traits, the way he wants to run his business. He's going to be obsessed with speed. He likes to take risks in bunches. He's really just intense and rather a little crazy. He's obsessed with speed with making decisions and acting on them as quickly as possible. He learned to take his risk in bunches in the Oklahoma oil fields. This is, he describes his reasoning why he takes risks in bunches. Some of your risks are bound to be busts. The more risks you take, the better the chance of one of them hitting. Don Tyson, who built the Tyson Poultry Empire, who I've already referenced a few times here, talked about his friend again during this time. I know a lot of intense people, but there is nobody as intense as Jerry Jones. Jerry is a little crazy. He can change moods without blinking. He's got two personalities. He's got the P.T. Barnum, the raconteur, the storyteller, and then on the other side is the tough businessman from Arkansas. He can immediately switch from very charming to a very tough man. Very few people know how to read him. His complexities as an individual can be disarming. He runs into any project believing that he can beat any man at anything. The man that overestimates himself. This is somebody who's done several interviews with Jerry, describes him. Life is not about smelling the roses with Jerry. Life is hard work. He just doesn't have any time for things like philosophy or poetry. You get the feeling that he will break your balls if you cross him. You have to be on guard with him at all times. And so when you actually analyze what he actually did when he took over the team, it's just this reminder, I think it's important, it's like most businesses are actually poorly run.
