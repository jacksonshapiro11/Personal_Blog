  I think a lot of our listeners would think when you say vision statement, mission statement, values, that they have the exact same skepticism that you might have had. How do you use the vision and the mission statement? Often they're things on a website or on a wall and people just like, whatever, it doesn't matter. I loved how the example of how you actually took the values and you use them to coach people and use them to make a difference in the company.
  David Heacock
  That was the big kind of aha moment for me, actually, was realizing we actually had a problem with a particular person. When I was doing, when I was building these values and just kind of, you know, going through the motions with it, we had a problem with an employee that, you know, on the surface, you would Say, well, you know, was there really anything they could have done them But like I knew like there were actions that they could have taken that, you know, would have taken a little more Effort to get it done. I thought, well, you know, this is the great example where, you know, if we have a biased action in this example as a core value, it's a coaching moment where we can say, hey, this is what We stand for. This is what is important. You're going to be reviewed on these values that we have, and we take them seriously, then all of a sudden that gives you a way to frame it with an employee. But the reality is that in my example, like they're so personal to me. And so like, I've been able to build this business on my own. And, you know, I think that's unique and I would not recommend it for most people. I actually think for most people, or I don't know what's right for most people. I only know what's right for me. And so once I realized that, you know, I could kind of personalize it and then get buy-in from the people around me that, that, because they see, they saw how these values that we exhibited Were the differentiator for us in growing this business. And we have tangible examples around each of those. Once I got the buy-in from that, then it's much easier to articulate and show to everybody within the company that, Hey, we actually take these seriously. And we give out an Employee of the Month award now that we started earlier this year, where we highlight somebody that actually exhibited one of our core values. We pick a different core value every month, and we find somebody that actually exhibited that and use that as a kind of coaching mechanism or as a way just to reward somebody who is living Up to our values. And so like once I realized how powerful that could be, then I really became, I really bought into it. But the key is they have to really be true. Like you can't just make them up. I think that so many people go through the exercise and it's aspirational and it's great to be aspirational. But if you're not willing to actually live by that, you yourself first. But then also, you know, if you have somebody that maybe is a high performer but is clearly not consistent with your values, you have to be willing to part ways with them, even if that's Going to be tough for a while for your company. And, you know, we take it to that level of extreme because it's, you know, to me, it's extremely important. And I think if you want to be successful with this, that you have to have that level of commitment.

  I want to rewind a little bit back to when you were doing all the jobs, you were traveling, you were spending all week in the factory, and then at night, you're sort of doing the other stuff. You came from Goldman. You didn't know anything about DTC marketing. How did you learn marketing? It's not 100% true in that I've been an entrepreneur since I was probably 10 years old.
  David Heacock
  And I was born in 1983 and really came of age in the 90s when the internet was just starting to come up. And so I always had side hustles and things that I was working on. And in my teenage years, I was basically assembling computers and selling them on eBay. And my eBay screen name was Momentum Corp. And I've always been a believer in momentum, I guess, from the early days. And I just think momentum in life and in businesses is so important. And I fight to maintain momentum always. And anytime I lose momentum, I hate it. But then I remember I got to go in and create that momentum again. We can maybe dig into that later. But, you know, I always kind of tinkering around with online businesses. And actually, in 2007, I had just moved to the trading desk from my economics research desk. And that was the beginning of the financial crisis. And I saw a lot of turmoil and saw a lot of people around me starting to get fired. And I was convinced I was going to lose my job. And my wife was in medical school at the time, and we had not taken on any debt for her medical school because I was paying for it. And I was determined not to take on any debt. And I started a side hustle where I was effectively an affiliate for StubHub. And it was quite scammy what I was doing. I was using Craigslist as a traffic source where I had a team of guys in Vietnam who were helping me to basically spam Craigslist to get traffic to a site that then ultimately would lead Them to StubHub and I would get a commission. But in 2008, I made about half a million dollars that year just on this side hustle doing affiliate marketing. And at the time, I realized that there's obviously a lot of money to be made in this kind of world. Wouldn't it be great if I owned the whole offer rather than being an affiliate if I owned my own product, so to speak? And I started a company called My Office Delivered, where we were effectively dropshipping office supplies. And in 2009, sold $6.5 million or so of office supplies, primarily on Amazon. And when I looked at the actual underlying data of it, about 60% of that was either air filters from a small company in Creole, Alabama called Filters Now or ink cartridges. Those are the two big markets or the two big things that drove a large portion of our revenue. So then fast forward into 2009, like my financial crisis ended up being great for me from a career perspective. And I got promoted and my career really took off. I ended up shutting down that business because I didn't have the energy to continue to do both. So I shut it down. But the reason I give you that answer, and it's something I talk about a lot with people, is people always talk about money being the limiting factor in starting a business or doing something New. And I think that the reality is the limiting factor for most people is the skills and the curiosity. And I, from an early age, was building those skills, building the online marketing skills, building the entrepreneurial skills that ultimately I'm still honing today.

  Momentum is everything. And it's such an intangible thing at the same time. In life, you know, in anything, you're either progressing or you're regressing. You know, there's really no steady state in reality. I mean, like our bodies deteriorate over time with no activity. There are just so many examples of this throughout life. And in business and in personal life or in health, I think it's very much the same. It's like you either are improving and building on something day in, day out, or you're declining. And the reality is, is that once you go through these periods of decline, even if it's micro periods of decline, it's oftentimes so hard to get your, you know, positive momentum to get To that, that improving again. And like the, like I've actually experienced it some this year and that, you know, like in a business, you know, you kind of ebb and flow. Like, I feel like you go through times, or at least I experienced times of kind of growth and you're pushing forward and you're, you know, you feel all this positive momentum, you're Doing things. And then for whatever reason, things kind of settle in a little bit and then it gets a little bit harder. And then you have to reignite that momentum again. And we had a lot of technical issues over the summer, including on Prime Day, I actually did a short about this, but we had a big Prime deal that was running. And by some glitch of the system, I got a call at three o'clock in the morning from someone at Amazon that our deal was not running and they were looking at fixing it. I got up, started monitoring it. And by nine o'clock in the morning, like still nobody could purchase any of our product that was on a deal on Amazon. And I had to kill that deal just so we could go back to being viable. And normally we would have expected an incremental $2 million or something of revenue on that deal that we didn't get. But I use that as an example because we had a few things like that that happened that just stuff happens when you're in business. And we had a much slower kind of few months in the summer than we were expecting. And I hated it, but I'd actually just hired a new CFO a couple months before. And like, he really took it personally. And he was like, he was, I think maybe even a little bit worried. He's like, wow, like, you know, we had all these kind of problems stack up. And like, but for me, I've been through that kind of situation so many times, it didn't even bother me. And like, we've actually now as a business, like gained a lot of momentum. And like we're really kind of over over indexing now for for from what we would have expected a few months ago. All the building blocks that you know you need in order to get that momentum from marketing and from sales and all the things that go into that. And it's just day in, day out grinding and pushing all of those things forward. And then you wake up one day and you're like, wow, we're over-indexing again. And it's because you built that momentum in your system to allow that to happen. And I've done it so many times in so many aspects of my life that I know inherently when I've kind of lost momentum or maybe I've lost focus on something that's important and I need to regain It. And I can consciously push that momentum forward or do the fundamental things that I know I need to do in order to regain that momentum if I repeat that consistently over some period of Time. So it's definitely a muscle that you build. But that's how I feel about it. And I think so many people have bad things that happen to them. And like, rather than going back to the fundamentals and like, hey, how am I going to start to dig out and regain that positive momentum in this? They linger on it for too long and let it atrophy, and then it's much harder to get that momentum. So anytime I see things, whether it be my health, my relationship, or business, or anytime I see things that are starting to show some cracks and starting to slow down a bit, then I'm very Conscious of that and say, oh, what do I need to do to get back to fundamentals to be able to put myself back on the path that I want to be on?
