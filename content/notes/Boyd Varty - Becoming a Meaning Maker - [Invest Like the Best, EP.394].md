### Highlights

- Seek Stories in the Uncharted
  Summary:
  Finding meaning and purpose involves actively seeking out stories and experiences that challenge and expand one's perspective.
  This process, termed 'story hunting,' requires a mindset of awareness and openness, pushing individuals to explore uncharted territories, both literally and metaphorically. Embracing curiosity invites unusual encounters and deep connections with others.
  Practicing storytelling hinges on attentiveness; by reflecting on life's experiences, individuals can uncover meaningful narratives.
  Great storytellers create contexts, facilitating understanding and inviting collective participation.
  Navigating fear serves as a catalyst for connection and growth, where the right approach transforms anxiety into opportunity, fostering resilience and camaraderie among groups. Ultimately, embracing life's unpredictability and sharing experiences enriches personal and communal meaning, evolving into a shared narrative that bonds individuals together.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  It's a big question, but finding meaning or purpose in the first place?
  Speaker 1
  It is a big question. And that's why I called it story hunting, because it is a turning of your attention. I think our first podcast was about tracking. I'm always interested in this idea of turning your attention onto something because that's essentially what tracking is. And that's why it became story hunting, because you have to develop a way of seeing and almost drop into a set of principles. So there's a few things that I said, the one was become someone's stories happen around. And I think of this all as a practice. So that is an awareness and an openness to life. It's a willingness to say yes, it's a willingness to try things. Often it's going into uncharted terrain. I had one friend who whenever we'd go on a hike, almost always if there was a path that said, this path is closed, he wanted to go down. So the first part is be someone stories happens around. And that to me is a mindset. I would say, be a character who finds characters. And what I mean by that is the more you become aware of what lights you up internally, the more you're willing to follow your curiosity, often that will pull you into unusual encounters. So many of the most amazing and outrageous people I've met, it's because I was willing to follow something. I think about recently that trail we went on together, Matt, who is this wild man trail guide. It's like a willingness to go and try things and you start having encounters with people who are very in tune with what brings them to life in the world.
  Speaker 2
  Can you explain him? That's a really good example of just a person that has this vibe about them. Maybe say a little bit more about Matt.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah. In the realms of be a character who finds character, he loves the wilderness. He loves wild places. His company is called Wild Child Africa. His central mission is to find the most remote wild places and then take people there. And so he's just following a love for what he likes to do. And then he's figuring out how to expose that to other people. And then even within those wild places, he finds ways to go on little adventures and have little experiences within them. I mean, this is a guy who's made friends with an eel in a pool in the Pondor lab. Something about that is like, he's full of that be someone stories happen around, be a character who finds characters. He's just living in that way. And then I would also say that storytelling is attention. We are so distracted most of the time. If you are a storyteller, you have to be paying attention and seeing what is actually there. One thing that I'll do with people early on, if they want to improve their storytelling, is I'll just say to them, tell me about your life. And there is something about taking time, even thinking about all of the threads that brought you to where you are, all of the plot twists, all of the unexpected encounters. And literally when you take the time to put attention on how you got to where you are, you start to find that there is a narrative component to life. There is meaning to the way that it all tied together. And literally when you take the time to put your attention on it, these threads start to come together. And so to get back to your original question, to become someone who can hold the meaning for the village, for the company, for the team, it requires you to start to turn your attention To what is meaningful to you, to be willing to be open enough to try things, to follow your own curiosity and meet interesting people. And it's an opening of your life and your attention. And the other thing then is I say that great storytellers are always context creators. And I think Steve Jobs was so good at this. If you watch old clips, he's so good at saying, here's how I'm thinking about this. Here's the challenges that come up when I think about this. Here's how I think we should be facing that. And here's the things I don't know about. He stays away from being just singularly positional and he just creates a context. And then into that, people start feeding their ideas. So the journey to actually finding more meaning is to start to open yourself to the awareness of your stories, what's going on here, looking with the right type of eyes. That's sort of how I start to think about how it constellates.
  Speaker 2
  What about fear? Thinking back on our most recent time together with Matt, if you just asked me to viscerally recall something from the trip, the two moments that come to mind were the two by far physical Scariest moments. And both of which are, like you said with the lion, in the moment, you're just kind of scared. But then after the fact, it becomes this thing imbued with meaning. What do you make of that, that it seems like so much of the meaning and purpose is found, like there's some fear in or around the path?
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, absolutely. And I think there's sort of a sweet spot there. There's the type of fear that's overwhelming and actually shuts you down. But then there's the type of fear that as you face it together, and you stand in the face of it, it actually brings you together. I mean, I think about we had to swim across that one wild piece of ocean. But again, the story there, the way that Matt framed it as a storyteller, is part of creating a shared sense of how we're going to do this together. This is a very rough piece of ocean. I can tell you that if you get sucked off to the side there, swim in that direction, and it'll pop you back in. We have a couple of guys here who are going to be the grabbers when people swim back. I am going to call the gap between the sets. And so he's giving us a sense of we do this with the right type of people. If you do this and we approach it with the right mentality, we can do it safely. We do have to take care of each other and be aware. But the briefing he gave us on that was a great example of helping us understand that this is an edge, but if we approach it properly, and if you follow my guidance and we work together, We can get through that. He created a frame for us to think about it. He created a context that we got to watch ourselves here, but he also created the guidelines for how to do it well together. And I think that was the perfect example of being up against an edge, but then framing it correctly so that people know how to handle it. He helped us understand how to feel about it. And I think that is so important as a leader. You're queuing people into how to feel about the situation. ([Time 0:09:25](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b4649678-2ee9-497a-b0f7-f822039e98fe))
    - **Note:** Awareness and openness to life where stories happen around you. Be a character who finds characters have great attention. Be open and curious to life no fear. Different types of fear there’s a fear that pulls you apart and then the fear that draws you together. Leaders frame the situation very well. Great stories need to be consciously worked on with people you know and don’t know. Culture starts with a shared narrative that compounds. At first, it’s an narrative or identity and then it becomes implicitctrage a shared language. The more authentic and personal a story is the more universal it is thematically. Find out who you are then build your life around that. Build a life to serve the authentic you. Don’t become a slave to your style or greatest hits. Simplicity and abundance.
- Cultivating Culture Through Storytelling
  Summary:
  Creating a strong organizational culture begins with consciously developing an identity and shared language that embeds itself over time.
  This identity evolves as individuals relate to a deepening narrative, shaping their connection to both the group and personal identity. By frequently communicating the story of the organization's origins and values, such as a commitment to excellence and care for the environment, members begin to internalize these principles, facilitating a culture of belonging.
  New members can quickly assimilate into this culture, often expressing its narrative they've only recently learned.
  The success of a culture relies on living out its principles daily, going beyond mere storytelling to actual practices.
  The practice of storytelling itself is a skill that can be developed, underscoring the importance of intentional, consistent communication in fostering a vibrant culture and achieving collective goals.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  At first, it's actually consciously creating an identity for yourself and the business. But then what it should become is an identity that people don't even have to think about it as an identity, it's just embedded. And so as people join and the culture deepens and the story of who we are deepens, it's like it becomes its own self-creating field. And individuals working within it relate to themselves as a part of that story, that culture, that way of being. So that's why I think early on, if you can create a shared language, consciously work on telling your story, it will result in the beginnings of a very, very deep culture. And actually a self-identity and a group identity, which is really what culture is.
  Speaker 2
  Maybe just to put a finer point on it with an example, how would you describe the Londo's culture and maybe the story that was the seed of what's become that culture?
  Speaker 1
  I think at this point, it's almost become a law. And there were elements to it. It begins with this incredible love. The business was founded with its three mud huts out of a sense that if we don't start something here, we're going to lose this wild piece of land. And then the founders almost lived the story into life. And at first it was a passion to restore the land. And then later it became a passion for excellence in service. Now over the years, that story has been told enough. It has become central to everything that happens there. And there's such a sense of who we are that has emerged out of that story, care of the land, care of the people there, making sure that we give people transformative healing experiences In nature. And it's just been spoken so much and then lived so much that it has now become a way of being. So the challenge of it, I guess, is that it becomes quite like, it's almost ethereal, but it is a culture of belonging. It is a culture that you join, and it's a group identity and an individual identity at the same time. It's a way we do things around here. People arrive now at Londo's, the culture, if they are not of the culture, and it's amazing how quickly people are assimilated into that culture, they expunge themselves almost. It's like an energetic beat that is off. My favorite thing is three or four weeks after a new person arrives at Londolozi. And I think of us actually consciously working on our narrative, being really good at storytelling, making sure we understand how to express that we've taken the time to express all The dimensions of what we're trying to do. And then you find yourself walking along one of the paths and you hear a new arrival coming the other way. And they are telling the story in literally something that you heard in a workshop two months ago that you've spoken about and put into our information about who we are. And then you start to see how it's translating and then living into it. I think also the story has to be backed up by daily ways of being and actions. And so that's why the story is the beginning of framing who we are and our identity, but then the real culture of it is brought to life by living it. How do you make that work?
  Speaker 2
  I love the notion of doing such a good job that the people in the culture, the story becomes portable and they start telling it. Is there any advice you'd give on how to make a story portable in that way and easy for someone to pick up and run with themselves?
  Speaker 1
  Yes. I would say that for us, we have our history, why and how we came to be where we are. Then we have who we are right now as a big part of the story. We're a futuristic African village. We take people on world-class encounters in nature. We're a culture business. We care about people. And we deeply believe that if we take a lot of time to make sure that this is an incredible place for people to live and work with dignity in South Africa, That results in amazing outputs. On the other side, we're obsessed with excellence. So we have these pillars and then we speak to them vigorously. And so when you're inducted at Londozi, all of these things will get told to you time and time again. One of our things is that we're a place and a space for individuals to become the best versions of themselves. It's focused towards being a growth environment, but we can then measure ourselves at every juncture. Are we living up to that? Are these individuals who've joined our team, are they becoming the best version of themselves? What do they need to grow? Because that's central to how we relate to ourselves. So on some deep level, once you've taken the time to work on it and frame it, you live it until it becomes a group identity. And then actually individual identities within that it should offend you to operate outside of your own cultural values on some level. When Duncan McLarty, the general manager sees something that is subpar, it offends him personally, because it's against who we are on some fundamental level. So again, I would say that what people don't realize is when they see good storytellers, they think, oh, he's just a good storyteller, and I'm not. And what I'm saying is that actually becoming a good storyteller is a mindset, and it's an approach. You can practice it. And becoming a good storyteller is taking the time to work on the craft of it and actually realize that if you get this stuff right, it can have an incredible impact into your life and into Your business and into your culture. But it does deserve being taken up as a powerful practice. ([Time 0:18:16](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7d4488bb-def9-432f-9f8f-75857f17c934))

- Embrace Reinvention to Unleash Originality
  Summary:
  Cultivating originality requires a commitment to self-reinvention and a deep understanding of internal drivers.
  Individuals should follow intrinsic motivations rather than conforming to societal expectations, leading to the discovery of unique identities and connections with others who foster creativity. The process of reinvention often necessitates stepping back from established identities to explore new possibilities, embracing discomfort and uncertainty to allow for transformative growth.
  By recognizing when one has become stagnant in their identity, individuals can actively engage in 'story hunting'—paying attention to original curiosities that reignite passion and authenticity.
  The art of self-reinvention involves a continuous cycle of letting go of outdated narratives and crafting new ones that reflect genuine interests.
  Solitude plays a crucial role in this process, enabling personal reflection and the development of a cohesive narrative, which subsequently informs collaborative efforts with others. A successful creative journey balances solitary exploration with collective experience, emphasizing that authenticity and meaningful storytelling emerge from self-awareness and introspection. Regularly stepping away from the demands of the external world is essential to nurture originality and cultivate the courage to forge a unique path.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And so my curiosity to follow to have that opportunity had resulted in me meeting a character like Chris. Into the frames that the culture tells you, this is who you should be and how you should be. But rather they take the time to get tuned into what actually they feel pulled to. And then they figure out how to build their life externally around those internal knowings. And that usually results in a very original person. And so I've said, be a character who finds characters, because willing to become a character, follow your own internal knowings, will lead you to other unusual people. And that's where the meaning of life is.
  Speaker 2
  There's density in being willing to live like that. All of this is very much in the realm of getting going. The opposite side of this is, let's say you do all that successfully, whatever, you build the culture, you build the company, you do the thing, you meet the characters. And we were talking earlier about before recording, becoming a sort of slave to your greatest hits, like the Eagles or something. And there's a question here around reinvention or returning to some core essence or curiosity that got you to where you are in the first place. What could you say about that corollary problem of like, you do the first thing successfully. And then again, the world tries to build a circle around you and wants you to do the thing it knows you for versus the thing that you want to do at your core or something like that.
  Speaker 1
  I mean, I think that's one of the deepest tensions of any creative process. The example that you use is one my sister loves where the Eagles get up at their concert in Vegas now and people are still screaming, play Hotel California. That's something they wrote 40 years ago. And then an artist becomes famous for a certain body of work, certain type of painting style. And then that's all that is commercially wanted of them. And so it's a deep tension. I think that that's why I consider story hunting a practice. And it should never be a destination. Now, with culture, it does embed, you know, but even as a business, you have to be constantly willing to look at it all and reinvent yourself. And the only way to do that is to be willing to be in states of reinvention yourself. I always think about personal identity. I think about practice. I think about how that could become an external expression, a group identity. In the coaching space, one thing we would say often is like being aware of your own stories. And I think that changing identity is an art form. And I think that you have to be self-aware enough to realize that there are times when change comes upon you as a result of a catalytic event. And there are times when you should, if with enough self-awareness sense that you are becoming calcified in your consciousness, in a certain identity. And the art of reinvention is exactly that. It's an art form. And it usually begins with some form of letting go of how we thought it had to be. It's Tiger Woods being a world champion, being the best in the world and going to reinvent his swing. It's a very, very courageous moment. And you can only know if you've reached that calcified place. And so then you have to go and melt down. And that's usually stepping out of life and allowing your ideas about who you think you are, who you would think you are meant to be, who other people have made you to be. You have to let that melt. And that means you have to step into like, I don't know what's going to be next and really dwell in that not knowing. And then the next phase would be to start to attune yourself to the meaning again. How do you hunt the story? You have to start paying attention to those original curiosities, things that pull you forward, characters who light you up and start to ask yourself, what is it about these things That grab my attention? And then you go into another phase of starting to build around that. If you are someone who can constantly put attention on transforming yourself, almost always new meaning will constellate around that. A new story of yourself will constellate around that. And sometimes in coaching, we will even say to someone, you can feel when someone's stuck in something and it's just become an old shtick. We'll actually say, you know, that's actually just starting to feel like a story. It doesn't feel like it has aliveness in it. So self-reinvention, the courage to self-reinvent, the courage to melt down and change your own identity, and to be in the practice then of hunting new stories and new ways of being. That is the art form of staying original, keeping your consciousness malleable and staying in tune with what actually brings you to life as opposed to being just rolling out your greatest Hits album for the next 30 years. I guess what I'm saying is this is a practice and you have to consciously practice it, consciously be stepping back and saying, does my story about who we are, who I am, even fit anymore?
  Speaker 2
  I'm thinking about the story lab, which is such a good idea. And the other people that I've turned to to teach me about components or elements of a good story. And the one that always comes to my mind is Graydon Carters, who used to run Vanity Fair and was certainly no stranger to a great story, which was basically narrative, conflict, and he Called it proprietary data, something I know that other people don't know. A great story has those three components to it, narrative conflict and some unique information that others could learn from. I'm curious your reaction to those three. I mentioned them just as an example of what I'm after with this question, which is the components to you of a great story.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, I think those are very strong. Just from a technical point of view, I think you want to start with something very unusual. So I think that the opening line of any piece of storytelling is incredibly important, because it immediately helps people know how to feel about where this is going. Then I think you should develop your characters. And you should help people understand how your characters were thinking about issues. Then you should help people understand what the challenge was and what the conflict was and how they got through it. Then you should have some callbacks to things you learned along the way. And then you should land it in a very universal place as much as possible. Those are more like technical beats. And then within that, I would say that the use of language is incredibly important. With a single word, you can change the real feeling of something. If I said, the buffalo was close by by the time I saw it, versus when I saw the buffalo, it was adjacent. There's just a difference in energy on th... ([Time 0:34:57](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5b246d92-3b83-4ae9-bef1-1d9adc9dd612))
    - **Note:** Changing your mind and rewriting your story. Explore thinking in solitude physically or with writing.
- Embrace High Stakes for True Aliveness
  Summary:
  Experiencing high stakes can significantly increase happiness and meaning in life.
  High optionality often leads to unhappiness, while being up against higher stakes forces individuals to engage more deeply with their experiences. The contrast between too much comfort and high stakes highlights the importance of maintaining meaning.
  Realizing that life is unpredictable encourages personal growth and new perspectives.
  A balance must be struck where stakes are high enough to foster aliveness and meaning, without tipping into overwhelming stress.
  Finding this sweet spot is essential for continuous learning and connecting with one's true self.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Can we talk about stakes, the role of high stakes, just in general? Because one of the most powerful things anyone ever told me, one of few people I would call a mentor said something to me to the effect of the most unhappy I've ever been is when I have the Most optionality. And the happiest I've ever been is when I have the highest stakes, meaning the fewest things that have to go right in order for things to work out or whatever. What have you learned about harnessing or creating high stakes and the role that that means to you and the role that that could play in story hunting?
  Speaker 1
  You know, the way that I think about it is levels of aliveness and levels of awareness. You'd have to ask yourself, what is the opposite of meaning? And I would say that things becoming too mechanical, too much familiarity, too much comfort, too much of the known almost is where it's hard to keep meaning alive. Now, it's not that it's not there. In deep states of Satori states, you would say that everything is just innately meaningful almost. When you really feel a oneness with everything, it's meaningful just in its beingness. Level of Satori. I would say you have to be moving towards what you know will bring you aliveness, to be up against something enough that it's forcing you to new places in yourself. It's forcing you to relate to life in new ways. And that tension of finding out that life's going to be not exactly what you think it's going to be, but it's also not exactly what life says it's going to be. It's this co-creative space. That is often where meaning is structured. And so if your life is short of meaning, it's probably because you aren't going up against enough aliveness. Now, stakes, people who are up against high stakes come back and have tremendous meaning. There's that amazing scene from The Hurt Locker where the soldier comes back and he's been living with such states and he's walking down the cereal aisle in the grocery store and it's Just totally dead to him because of where he's been. I would say that you can get overwhelmed by states to the point where it's just stressful and it actually starts to become subtractive somehow to your energy. But I think that if there's not enough meaning in your life, you're not fully up against enough of your aliveness. And then that means you have to turn your attention on. You need to be hunting the story a little more thoroughly. And there is a sweet spot where you're on your edge in a way that is generative and adding to you and forcing you to learn new things, constellate yourself in new ways. And then you can tip over that edge into an overwhelm where the stakes are probably a little too high. So to try and find your way into that sweet spot is powerful.

- Embrace Simplicity to Discover Authenticity
  Summary:
  Simplicity offers the gift of a relaxed, profound connection with life, revealing the importance of social structures that thrive on shared experiences.
  The Bushman people's way of life exemplifies a rich simplicity, devoid of modern distractions, contrasting sharply with the increasing complexity of contemporary existence. In the face of rapid technological advancements, the lesson drawn is the value of being present and deeply engaged with one another.
  Characters are defined by their authenticity, awareness of their own vitality, and a willingness to break free from societal norms.
  Those who create their own narratives embody originality and courage, inspiring others through their undeterred belief in their paths.
  Their journey is fueled by passion and a commitment to self-discovery, resulting in an infectious energy that encourages a deeper exploration of life.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Another phrase that I heard you use in your new series is simplicity in abundance. Quite like that. Can you explain that?
  Speaker 1
  Simplicity in abundance and simplicity as abundance. I think that what I learned from being with the Bushman people is that, I mean, so many things. The one is that they consider the simplicity of their life, the gift of it. And they have these incredible social structures. They will usually operate and move in the desert through the early morning, gathering, hunting, and then they rest together through the middle of the day. They share everything because they feel that the desert provides everything that they need. And it's very hard to spend time with them sitting under a tree, lying in the sand. There's this relaxed, incredible social connection just to wonder, man, are we getting it right in any way, shape or form, as we add more complexity and more intensity to our lives? There's just something so pure. And without being constantly bombarded by devices or stories of things happening around the world, they just drop into this quiet, simple presence with each other. And I found it to be very, very powerful and transformative. And I also thought to myself, if you imagine that with the generation of AI now, the world will probably change more in the next five years than it has in the previous hundred. I kept having this feeling that being with them out in the desert, was I 300 years in the past or was I somehow in the apocalyptic future where whatever happens, happens, they just walk Quietly back into the desert and continue to live their lives. It was a deep presence for me.
  Speaker 2
  You talk about seeking out characters to become one. What makes a character? What are the features of the people that you find yourself most drawn to?
  Speaker 1
  That's what I got obsessed with it. One is their inside out. They're attuned to their own aliveness in some ways. They know what brings them to life. They're authentic. And so authenticity and originality is a byproduct of that. They have been willing to walk their own path and break out of social constraints. And I think that's a big one. If you think of most people being highly socialized, a character has broken that and become more self-authored. They're creating their own story, literally. And the word authored is they have their own narrative about themselves. They're not trying to fit themselves in with the cocktail scene of where they're from. Often they have made a bold decision to do that. And they've been willing to do something out of a knowingness in themselves before it existed. If I think of the characters I grew around, part of it is that they believed that they could do certain things that there was no safari industry. They were making it up. They came from hunting, but then they self-defined into what they could become. They're willing to be on the journey and realize that we don't know what this is yet, but I'm interested enough in it. And it brings me to life enough that we could still be finding out what it is. It's really the first two principles, be someone's stories happen around and be a character. Those are the two things that bring you to great characters. And then there's usually a moral sense almost where they believe in their path and they're unswayed by it, unswayed by other people's opinions. And they're courageously standing in that in some ways. And then quite often, if they've had the courage to persevere at that, then being around them is usually quite inspiring. It's almost like an embodied activism. Their sense of self, their sense of what they're doing, their sense of knowing what their speed is in life. When you get around it, there's usually passion there because they've had the courage to find out what that thing is that brings them to life. And that becomes very, very infectious.

    - **Note:** Being a character and living in practice. Simplicity in abundance.
