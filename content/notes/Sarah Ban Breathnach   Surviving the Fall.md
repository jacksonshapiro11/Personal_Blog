  Speaker 1
  So tell me the simple abundance sold five million copies in the United States another two million abroad seven million copies were you getting at least a dollar for every book were you getting at least that. Yeah. Probably more. You don't have to tell me everything but did that was that heady for you. Oh yeah.
  Speaker 2
  But you know there there was this little ritual then in publishing when the Times List for the next week would come out and on Wednesday and you'd get a call at six p.m. And they say yours number one again. And it was like oh my gosh you know very heady you know have a glass of champagne and yeah that went on for almost two years. Really. Yeah and then came. How long were you number one? I was number one for almost a year. Wow. Yeah. And it was on there for like 119 weeks. Wow. That's amazing. It is amazing. But what I wanted to share with you and I've never shared because you don't get much sympathy for this. The Wednesday that there was no call. So oh that's sort of strange.
  Speaker 1
  We haven't heard from the Times.
  Speaker 2
  We haven't heard them. They haven't called. And so I called my agent. I said I haven't heard anything. She said well you're not on the list this week.
  Speaker 1
  How was that? I cried. I cried. I did 119 weeks.
  Speaker 2
  I cried. And I thought no one in the world will understand what this feels like. The only trouble with being number one is eventually you have to be number two, three and four.
  Speaker 1
  Because life moves on. It does. It does. But hadn't you prepared yourself or had you prepared yourself? One day you have to say well what's going to happen when that call doesn't come. But I didn't.
  Speaker 2
  You never did. No. That's one of the lessons I wish I had realized. I wish I had learned that life is cyclical. Success goes in cycles. See I believe that if you did the very best of your work, which was simple abundance, and you continued to do that, that you'd be received in the same way.
  Speaker 1
  You gained it all. You come into, you leave the store with eight pairs of Manolo Blanigs. And you are spending money. I remember calling you one day in London and you had bought the Isaac Newton's Chapel. And I remember hanging up the phone going whoa. Sarah is what? Isaac Newton's Chapel.
  Speaker 2
  That must have cost you a pretty penny. It didn't actually. Really? Renovating it. Yeah. Right.
  Speaker 1
  That did cost a pretty penny. So you end up in Isaac Newton's Chapel as your home. And you are flying the Concorde like it's greyhound. Right. Yes. Really? Yeah. So you quickly rose to that lifestyle. Yes.
  Speaker 2
  Mm-hmm.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah. Did you know what you could afford and couldn't afford at that time?
  Speaker 2
  No. I also didn't know as I took on staff.
  Speaker 1
  I also didn't know how much that was all costing. So you took on, you had nine assistants. I had nine assistants. Yeah. Nine assistants, their salaries, health insurance, their travel, their mortgage. Yeah. Yeah. So did you have the, I've often said that money and fame only puts a magnifying glass on who you really are. So did you have the need to please everyone? Mm-hmm.
  Speaker 2
  Yeah. I thought that for my close friends and my family. Well, I loved buying gifts. That's number one. But I also loved solving problems because it was so easy. Was there. I could just write a check, you know, to help.
  Speaker 1
  Let me ask you this. Do you feel that there was a part of you? Because if I were to be completely truthful with myself, which I try to be, when I, going back over my life and mistakes that I've made with money, was there a part of you who wanted to be the savior to those friends and family?
  Speaker 2
  Yes, I did so.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah. Yeah. There was an ego thing involved. Even though you didn't want to give it, there's a part of you that feels like, well, I'm doing this for you.
  Speaker 2
  Well, maybe not. I'm doing this for you in that way, but, you know, well, I'm doing it. You know, I can do it and I will. A lady bountiful, let's say. Yeah. You know, it made me happy to make other people happy.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, I would say that. Yeah. That there's no greater reward in giving than having the receiver be grateful for what you've given.
  Speaker 2
  Yes. And to acknowledge that you've made a difference in your life. But then there comes a moment with some people and they assume that you will do it. It is the entitlement. And when I reached that, if I reached that, that was a cut off point. That when I realized that, you know, you don't even ask, you just assume that I'm going to take care of something. And no.
  Speaker 1
  This is what I love that you were honest enough to say in peace and plenty. Not right do I have to be giving other women advice on how to live their lives when I've messed up mine so completely. I feel myself shrinking inside, becoming very shy and small. The incredible withering woman. How did I get here? How will I ever get back to financial sanity and serenity? So you say you wrote this book, not just certainly not to try to make a best seller because I don't even know how you do that, but you wrote it for your own sanity and serenity. And how did you answer that question? What right do I have to be giving other women advice?
  Speaker 2
  I don't know that I have still answered it. I think that I speak truth and I speak it lovingly and that I acknowledge my own mistakes. I made every money mistake a woman could have personally and in business.
  Speaker 1
  But that's their mistakes. Why did you make those mistakes?
  Speaker 2
  I really thought it would continue. I really thought it would continue because I was putting out the best that I could do. I did not slack.
  Speaker 1
  You were like a rock star with a hit album, hit book, who thought that I will just continue to make the hits and the hits will keep on coming and I will go on tour and it will be here forever. Right.
  Speaker 2
  Yeah. Because I thought that the initial making of the money was the big hurdle. Mm-hmm.
  Speaker 1
  Okay. So this is what I feel strongly about and that is not only is life cyclical, not only ([Time 0:05:44](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f1a83423-8b9f-42aa-b553-6bee69fb5e41))

  So tell me the simple abundance sold five million copies in the United States another two million abroad seven million copies were you getting at least a dollar for every book were you getting at least that. Yeah. Probably more. You don't have to tell me everything but did that was that heady for you. Oh yeah.
  Speaker 2
  But you know there there was this little ritual then in publishing when the Times List for the next week would come out and on Wednesday and you'd get a call at six p.m. And they say yours number one again. And it was like oh my gosh you know very heady you know have a glass of champagne and yeah that went on for almost two years. Really. Yeah and then came. How long were you number one? I was number one for almost a year. Wow. Yeah. And it was on there for like 119 weeks. Wow. That's amazing. It is amazing. But what I wanted to share with you and I've never shared because you don't get much sympathy for this. The Wednesday that there was no call. So oh that's sort of strange.
  Speaker 1
  We haven't heard from the Times.
  Speaker 2
  We haven't heard them. They haven't called. And so I called my agent. I said I haven't heard anything. She said well you're not on the list this week.
  Speaker 1
  How was that? I cried. I cried. I did 119 weeks.
  Speaker 2
  I cried. And I thought no one in the world will understand what this feels like. The only trouble with being number one is eventually you have to be number two, three and four.
  Speaker 1
  Because life moves on. It does. It does. But hadn't you prepared yourself or had you prepared yourself? One day you have to say well what's going to happen when that call doesn't come. But I didn't.
  Speaker 2
  You never did. No. That's one of the lessons I wish I had realized. I wish I had learned that life is cyclical. Success goes in cycles. See I believe that if you did the very best of your work, which was simple abundance, and you continued to do that, that you'd be received in the same way.
  Speaker 1
  You gained it all. You come into, you leave the store with eight pairs of Manolo Blanigs. And you are spending money. I remember calling you one day in London and you had bought the Isaac Newton's Chapel. And I remember hanging up the phone going whoa. Sarah is what? Isaac Newton's Chapel.
  Speaker 2
  That must have cost you a pretty penny. It didn't actually. Really? Renovating it. Yeah. Right.
  Speaker 1
  That did cost a pretty penny. So you end up in Isaac Newton's Chapel as your home. And you are flying the Concorde like it's greyhound. Right. Yes. Really? Yeah. So you quickly rose to that lifestyle. Yes.
  Speaker 2
  Mm-hmm.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah. Did you know what you could afford and couldn't afford at that time?
  Speaker 2
  No. I also didn't know as I took on staff.
  Speaker 1
  I also didn't know how much that was all costing. So you took on, you had nine assistants. I had nine assistants. Yeah. Nine assistants, their salaries, health insurance, their travel, their mortgage. Yeah. Yeah. So did you have the, I've often said that money and fame only puts a magnifying glass on who you really are. So did you have the need to please everyone? Mm-hmm.
  Speaker 2
  Yeah. I thought that for my close friends and my family. Well, I loved buying gifts. That's number one. But I also loved solving problems because it was so easy. Was there. I could just write a check, you know, to help.
  Speaker 1
  Let me ask you this. Do you feel that there was a part of you? Because if I were to be completely truthful with myself, which I try to be, when I, going back over my life and mistakes that I've made with money, was there a part of you who wanted to be the savior to those friends and family?
  Speaker 2
  Yes, I did so.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah. Yeah. There was an ego thing involved. Even though you didn't want to give it, there's a part of you that feels like, well, I'm doing this for you.
  Speaker 2
  Well, maybe not. I'm doing this for you in that way, but, you know, well, I'm doing it. You know, I can do it and I will. A lady bountiful, let's say. Yeah. You know, it made me happy to make other people happy.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, I would say that. Yeah. That there's no greater reward in giving than having the receiver be grateful for what you've given.
  Speaker 2
  Yes. And to acknowledge that you've made a difference in your life. But then there comes a moment with some people and they assume that you will do it. It is the entitlement. And when I reached that, if I reached that, that was a cut off point. That when I realized that, you know, you don't even ask, you just assume that I'm going to take care of something. And no.
  Speaker 1
  This is what I love that you were honest enough to say in peace and plenty. Not right do I have to be giving other women advice on how to live their lives when I've messed up mine so completely. I feel myself shrinking inside, becoming very shy and small. The incredible withering woman. How did I get here? How will I ever get back to financial sanity and serenity? So you say you wrote this book, not just certainly not to try to make a best seller because I don't even know how you do that, but you wrote it for your own sanity and serenity. And how did you answer that question? What right do I have to be giving other women advice?
  Speaker 2
  I don't know that I have still answered it. I think that I speak truth and I speak it lovingly and that I acknowledge my own mistakes. I made every money mistake a woman could have personally and in business.
  Speaker 1
  But that's their mistakes. Why did you make those mistakes?
  Speaker 2
  I really thought it would continue. I really thought it would continue because I was putting out the best that I could do. I did not slack.
  Speaker 1
  You were like a rock star with a hit album, hit book, who thought that I will just continue to make the hits and the hits will keep on coming and I will go on tour and it will be here forever. Right.
  Speaker 2
  Yeah. Because I thought that the initial making of the money was the big hurdle. Mm-hmm.
  Speaker 1
  Okay. So this is what I feel strongly about and that is not only is life cyclical, not only ([Time 0:05:44](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1677a703-439d-4324-bc05-32724219f7df))
