  In addition to starting seven separate billion dollar companies, Brad also listens to founders, send me a very nice message saying that he was addicted to listening to these book reviews, And he was kind enough to send me an early copy of this book a few months ago, and I read it and wanted to make an episode or to release the episode rather when it's available so you can actually Order it, which I highly recommend that you do, and that'll be obvious as we go through some of the ideas contained in Brad's book. So I want to jump right into it. He says, I've come to know a lot of extremely successful people in my life. They all have one thing in common. They think differently than most people. All of them, to a person, have rearranged their brains to prevail at achieving big goals in turbulent environments where conventional thinking often fails. I want to read one more sentence and I'm going to read you this quote from Peter Thiel that popped to my mind when I got to this section of the book. I love that. What he said, all of them to a person have rearranged their brains to prevail at achieving big goals in turbulent environments where conventional thinking often fails, making a few Billion dollars doesn't just happen, but it's possible with intense focus and a willingness to transform how you use your mind. That is the first chapter. So I got to this section immediately when I read that. One of my favorite quotes from Peter Thiel popped into my mind and Peter said, the single most powerful pattern that I have noticed is that successful people find value in unexpected Places and they do this by thinking about business from first principles instead of formulas. ([Time 0:04:24](https://share.snipd.com/snip/96e663eb-4a0c-4c8f-9c35-4517c8f3453c))
    - **Note:** Successful people find value in unexpected places by thinking about business from first principles instead of formulas. Rearrange your brain to focus not on conventional thinking but in turbulent environments where conventional thinking don’t work. Success is keeping your mind in a good place expect positive outcomes entrepreneurship is hard and you need the inner strength to go and be successful reframe negative thoughts as useful data. Problems are opportunity in work clothes when something is going negative how would handle it and how would you advise a friend to do things in that situation first chapters about managing your mind and attitude. Don’t expect perfection and beat yourself up from unrealistic standards. Emotions blur judgement stay calm. Believes in thought experiments. Spends a lot of time meditating and doing thought experiments believed meditation is key to success.

  I flew up to New York just for like 16 hours just to go to the book launch and meet Brad. What was fascinating and I had this inclination is like he's just got great energy. He's got great. I hate to say that I have no other way to say this. It's just a great personal vibe when you're like in person with him. And I talked to people that work for him. They said the same thing. They like love him. They enjoy like the work environment that he's created. And the best source I know to experience like how Brad is is I would listen to the invest like the best episode that Brad did with my friend Patrick. It's episode 352 of invest like the best and Brad in that interview talks a lot about the importance of meditating. He's been meditating I think for over 50 years. And as he says right here in the book, he feels it's been a huge benefit to his career because that's where he feels many of his best decisions actually materialize. So let's go to this. What I mentioned earlier that business is problems. This comes up over and over again that businesses problems and great companies. The way I think about it is great companies are just effective problem solving machines. And I first heard that idea or that idea was planted into my mind maybe seven years ago when I read Danny Meyer, the famous restaurant tour, his autobiography. And Brad's going to talk about his most important business mentor and the lesson that he taught Brad when Brad was in his 20s. ([Time 0:13:07](https://share.snipd.com/snip/26b51254-f676-4352-868d-53e1f35c65dd))
    - **Note:** Business is problems abd good companies are effective problem solving machines. Found a mentor which was important business is problems and being good in business just means you can effectively handle problens. Find problems embrace and enjoy it because each problem is the ability to remove an obstacle to success. Road to success is paved with mistakes well handled. Business success is creative problem solving. Problems are an asset and guidepost something to run towards. Gets excited about waste. Biggest problems create the biggest opportunities indifference to problems. Impossible to be perfect. See the world as it is not as you want it to be radical acceptance. Lost 500mm on a bad thesis but selling was the best thing at the time so he accepted that and cut his losses.

  Speaker 1
  The short seller crisis had made our stock extremely cheap. And instead of fixating on that as bad, we focus on achieving a good outcome. From that perspective, the share price was mono from heaven. And we decided to buy back $2 billion with the stocks. This is what I mentioned earlier, where the bankers are like $2 billion. It's way too high. You can't do that. It's too high of a percentage of your market cap. No one's ever done something like that. And Brad's like, who cares? Just because we were the first company to buy back such a high percentage of our stock member goes from the opening. It's like you have to that you can't rest on conventional wisdom is the way Brad put it. You have to rearrange your brain. The way Peter Thiel says is, hey, successful people find value in unexpected places and they do so by thinking about business from first principles instead of formulas. There is no formula for the situation that Brad's dealing with. Or if there was, he'd be like, oh, buy a little bit, buy like a hundred million back, but you can't buy $2 billion. What are you nuts? Just because we were the first company to buy back such a high percentage of our stock in a similar situation didn't mean it was a bad idea. In fact, it was a once in a lifetime opportunity. A couple of years later, those $2 billion of shares we brought back, we bought back, ended up being worth $6 billion, giving them a profit on that one transaction of $4 billion. Okay, moving on. This might be my favorite section in the entire book. I love how he describes all the research he does before he jumps into an industry and it's this idea that he gets. ([Time 0:25:42](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5233ae72-8cee-44e7-96ee-078f98d00589))
    - **Note:** There was a short seller report that led to a 20% sell off he read it picked about the arguments didn’t agree with it bought back 2bn of stock and made 4bn bankers told him no but he was focused in the right path from first principles. Understands the big trend and wants to get that right. Yiu can miss a lot of other things when you get the big one right. Invest in technology and always embrace it and the saving compound. He found data advantage where he collected hard to get data transcribe it and share it across the org gave him a massive info advantage. This gave him a moat for hours of continuous work he had a massive advantage. He saw an advantage in a waste industry where people were making these big profits with unsophisticated operators that could easily optimize routes and that tech investment made them by far the best with just a little route tech optimization then rolls it up. He acquires a construction business then the best software and data player in that industry which basically gives him a through line to everything happening so he can see changes in demand real time and adjust prices while the competition acted in a lag huge advantage

  - Invest heavily in tech to make a lot of money in any industry
  - Research extensively through reading, interviews, analysis, and attending conferences
  - Seek insights from industry experts, investment bankers, venture capital firms, and industry vendors
  - Consider the value of hard-to-get data in identifying market opportunities

  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  If you want to make a lot of money in almost any industry, plan to invest heavily in tech. So this is how we start doing research before he starts a new company. I start by reading everything I can get my hands on. Journals, periodicals, newspapers, trade publications, employee reviews on web-based recruiting sites, you name it. I look up, I look at all the websites and social media of the major players and the up-and-comers in the industry. I watch lots of interviews with the CEOs. I use paid services like Bloomberg, AlphaSense and Thomas Rooters. I look at analysis from CellSide and Bicyde Analysts. And I search this SCC database, which has large amounts of information on every publicly traded US company, including IPO documents, financial reports and proxies. I scope out the most valuable industry conferences and I attend them. He goes to CellSide conferences because they're an opportunity to meet management teams face-to-face and hear the questions investors are asking. Trade associations have a wealth of industry data. I interview experts. I seek out people who live and breathe the industry that I'm considering. This phase of the research is about getting face-to-face and listening intently. I love talking to CEOs. In addition to CEOs, I seek out investment bankers who are most active in the industry and who know it deeply. Just look at how much work and how much information is collected. It keeps going. So it says, in addition to CEOs, I seek out investment bankers who are most active in the industry and who know it deeply. I also talk to venture capital firms because they spend a lot of time looking at the big trends in different industries. I tap Bicyde institutions and successful fund managers who have battle scars from investing in that industry. Industry vendors keep going. Industry vendors are also a good source. They have a sense of the trends that could drive changes in the market. And finally, or not finally, there's two more. Shareholder activists often have important insights as well. And I reach out to journalists who know the industry because by nature, they're a skeptical bunch and I want to hear their perspectives. So then what he'll do is he runs through short descriptions of how to get the major trend right in a bunch of the businesses that he started. And this goes over 40 years. What's interesting is the first one. So he talks about Amorex and Hamilton resources. And it's about his time in the oil industry. It reminded me of a very important idea that I think that it's that you see applied to a bunch of different industries. This idea that you can identify a market with valuable but hard to get data. And my favorite application of this because it's just so nuts was the episode I did on the billionaire Art dealer, Larry Gagosian. Episode 325, if you haven't listened to that episode, it was fascinating because that's exactly what he did. He identified a market with valuable but hard to get data and then essentially made his, I made like a personal treasure map that that his entire business rests upon. So that came to mind when I was reading this section. A little bit of luck put me in the oil industry in 1979 when I started my oil brokerage company Amorex. It was a highly profitable business. ([Time 0:28:41](https://share.snipd.com/snip/86f478ff-bcb2-495f-87a6-9e3b4bfc4df5))
    - **Note:** His process for understanding an industry worth a read and going really deep. Identifying an industry with a map and hard to get data. Data advantage.
- The Importance of Acquiring a Software Company for Business Growth
  Key takeaways:
  - He purchased Win Systems, which provided a best platform and access to industry trends data
  - The software acquisition enabled proactive pricing and asset management
  - Opportunity can arise after a loss and turn out to be a blessing in disguise
  - Covering unexpected issues is crucial in deal-making
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  It's very straightforward business. So what does he do? I bought Win Systems. He bought the software that all of the main players were using. Owning Win accomplished two things. One, we had an industry best platform that we can continue to develop internally for our own use, and the acquisition gave us access to aggregated, anonymized data on macro trends across The industry. This gave us a high-level view of emerging market trends such as equipment gluts or shortages in the making. What is buying the software company allowing them to do? We could now proactively adjust our pricing and asset management while the rest of the industry was being reactive. I'm going to repeat that. That is so important. We could proactively adjust our pricing and asset management while the rest of the industry, the rest of our competitors, was being reactive. Okay, so then I love this story that comes from the chapter on how to do lots of high-quality M&A without imploding. It reminds me of one of my favorite sayings that I bring up a lot that opportunity is a strange beast and it frequently appears after a loss. What can appear to be a terrible thing actually ones up being a blessing in disguise. So he gives us some advice. He says, be sure to cover your flank. It's the stuff that comes out of left field that can take a deal down. In 2007, I sold United Rentals to the private equity firm Cerberus. ([Time 0:37:42](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2de12eef-cabe-48a7-a3d9-71a8564ddf21))
    - **Note:** Cover your flank it’s what you don’t see that can kill you and take a deal down. He sold United rentals to Cerberus for 7bn then gfc they pulled out now it’s worth 40bn. Stock fell bigly but they regrouped righted the ship and got successful. Opportunity is strange beast often comes after a loss. Best deals are the deals he’s avoided. He prioritizes data from front line employees and wants to know and see from the front of what’s going on. Executives give you overly roses picture you need to see from the front. Asks everyone what the single best idea to improve the company then asks what the stupidest thing you’re doing for the company. Solicit feedback constantly. Ask how you’re doing as a dad and friend get information. Single best idea to improve friendship family or company.
- Taking Competitors Out to Lunch
  Key takeaways:
  - Hertz took 37 years to build a billion-dollar revenue, while United rentals achieved the same in just 13 months
  - Inviting competitors to lunch to ask them to slow down is a losing strategy
  - United rentals ended up making six times the amount of money compared to Hertz
  - Maxims are not hard rules and should be broken when necessary
  - Perfectionism should be avoided
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And Brad has this great line here. He's like, yeah, Hertz did this. And they built up a national equipment rental chain to about a billion dollars of annual revenue over the course of 37 years. United rentals did that in 13 months. And so he gets this invitation. Come have lunch with the CEO. He's like, oh, maybe he's like trying to buy me out. Like what's happening? Let's just let me go over there to see what's up. And he was ridiculous. And the know of myself is a losing strategy. Take your competitor out to lunch and ask him to slow down. And essentially that's what he did. He's like, you know, you maybe change one of my taglines. I had the largest car rental company and the largest equipment rental company in the world. And now I've got the largest car rental company and the second largest equipment rental company. I don't want to be second in anything. And he's telling him to slow down. You're making a mess of this industry. You're going too fast. You're going to mess this up and fast forward several years. And their United rentals is making like six times the amount of money. So that is a losing strategy. Do not take your competitor out to lunch and be like, please slow down. Please be nicer to me. No, foot on the gas and foot on their neck. I want to go back to the maxims that are in the acknowledgement because this thing about maxims is they're not hard rules and you need to know when to break the rules. And so he has this idea that you should lose perfectionism. ([Time 0:45:10](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3a09a008-b82a-4810-9052-4870a3179afa))
    - **Note:** Keep speed foot on the gas and foot on the competitions neck. Aim for protection in hiring an empty seat is worse than a poor fit. Find nd hang out with the he best people they are power laws. Sceeen for superior intelligence tests iq and dialectic thinking which is the ability to view things from different perspectives and synthesize them. Then asks if they can change opinion. Hire ambitious people and better to be understaffed than overstaffed. Big on vibes and work with people you like. Can’t have c players. Difference between a, b, c players if a player quits your happy if a b does your sad but you’ll find someone an a player you’ll panic always overpay a players. It’s almost impossible to overpay for talent. You can’t save money by underpaying talent it always costs more in the long run. Apple paid next 500mm to get jobs back it was a genius move. Watch costs except with people because people are power laws. Underpaying can cost you millions. People want to make money and that’s a clear motivator. Put customers on pedestal support family. Good deep on a project and go all in. We can make our life meaningful
