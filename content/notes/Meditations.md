### Highlights

- Eleusinian Mysteries, a set of mystic rites connected with the worship of Demeter, the goddess of agriculture. ([Location 172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=172))

- All events are determined by the logos, and follow in an unbreakable chain of cause and effect. Stoicism is thus from the outset a deterministic system that appears to leave no room for human free will or moral responsibility. In reality the Stoics were reluctant to accept such an arrangement, and attempted to get around the difficulty by defining free will as a voluntary accommodation to what is in any case inevitable. ([Location 219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=219))
    - **Tags:** #rationality, #free-will
    - **Note:** No free will very interesting i like the cause and effect idea (proximate vs root causes) this is ideal but the world (humans) are irrational. the first step toward rationality is accepting you will never get there.
- man is like a dog tied to a moving wagon. If the dog refuses to run along with the wagon he will be dragged by it, yet the choice remains his: to run or be dragged. In the same way, humans are responsible for their choices and actions, even though these have been anticipated by the logos and form part of its plan. Even actions which appear to be—and indeed are—immoral or unjust advance the overall design, which taken as a whole is harmonious and good. They, too, are governed by the logos. But the logos is not simply an impersonal power that governs and directs the world. It is also an actual substance that pervades that world, not in a metaphorical sense but in a form as concrete as oxygen or carbon. In its physical embodiment, the logos exists as pneuma, a substance imagined by the earliest Stoics as pure fire, and by Chrysippus as a mixture of fire and air. Pneuma is the power—the vital breath—that animates animals and humans. ([Location 222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=222))
    - **Note:** Good description of stoicism
- metaphysical and ethical ones: Why are we here? How should we live our lives? How can we ensure that we do what is right? How can we protect ourselves against the stresses and pressures of daily life? How should we deal with pain and misfortune? How can we live with the knowledge that someday we will no longer exist? It would be both pointless and impertinent to try to summarize Marcus’s responses; the influence of the Meditations on later readers springs in part from the clarity and insistence with which he addresses these questions. ([Location 307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=307))

    - **Note:** Big questions. There are these big existential questions that guide your life and being awake to them, and considering them throughout your life is a key to living of fulfilling life. How should we live our lives.
- Ideally this print will be an accurate and faithful representation of the original. But it may not be. It may be blurred, or it may include shadow images that distort or obscure the original. Chief among these are inappropriate value judgments: the designation as “good” or “evil” of things that in fact are neither good nor evil. ([Location 321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=321))
    - **Note:** Relativity no good or bad only news
- It is by no means the only possible interpretation, and I am not obliged to accept it. I may be a good deal better off if I decline to do so. It is, in other words, not objects and events but the interpretations we place on them that are the problem. Our duty is therefore to exercise stringent control over the faculty of perception, with the aim of protecting our mind from error. ([Location 327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=327))
    - **Tags:** #bias-(inherent-in-models), #perception-vs-interpretation, #agency

- Everywhere, at each moment, you have the option: ([Location 365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=365))
    - **Note:** Three disciplines
- “We cannot step twice into the same river,” Heraclitus had said, and we see Marcus expanding on the observation: “Time is a river, a violent current of events, glimpsed once and already carried past us, and another follows and is gone” ([Location 410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=410))
    - **Tags:** #time-(nature-of/quantum), #no-one-steps-in-the-same-river-twice
    - **Note:** The passing of time. We don’t step in the same river twice.
- As for humans, our role is simply to live as best we can, making the most of what pleasures are available to us and insulating ourselves as far as possible from pain and anxiety. In particular, we are to feel no anxiety about death, which consists simply in the dissolution of our component atoms. This process is not only inevitable, but harmless, for the simple reason that after death there is no “us” to suffer harm. ([Location 430](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=430))

And on freeing yourself from all other distractions. Yes, you can—if you do everything as if it were the last thing you were doing in your life, and stop being aimless, stop letting your emotions override what your mind tells you, stop being hypocritical, self-centered, irritable. You see how few things you have to do to live a satisfying and reverent life? If you can manage this, that’s all even the gods can ask of you.

- So make your choice straightforwardly, once and for all, and stick to it. Choose what’s best. —Best is what benefits me. As a rational being? Then follow through. Or just as an animal?

- Or is it your reputation that’s bothering you? But look at how soon we’re all forgotten. The abyss of endless time that swallows it all. The emptiness of all those applauding hands. The people who praise us—how capricious they are, how arbitrary. And the tiny region in which it all takes place. The whole earth a point in space—and most of it uninhabited. How many people there will be to admire you, and who they are. ([Location 1132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1132))

- So there are two reasons to embrace what happens. One is that it’s happening to you. It was prescribed for you, and it pertains to you. The thread was spun long ago, by the oldest cause of all. The other reason is that what happens to an individual is a cause of well-being in what directs the world—of its well-being, its fulfillment, of its very existence, even. Because the whole is damaged if you cut away anything—anything at all—from its continuity and its coherence. Not only its parts, but its purposes. And that’s what you’re doing when you complain: hacking and destroying. ([Location 1332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1332))

- What am I doing with my soul? Interrogate yourself, to find out what inhabits your so-called mind and what kind of soul you have now. A child’s soul, an adolescent’s, a woman’s? A tyrant’s soul?
