### Highlights

- Episode AI notes
  1. The space industry is projected to be a trillion-dollar market by the 2030s, with satellites playing a crucial role.
  2. Satellites operate in geostationary orbit, low-Earth orbit, and mid-Earth orbit, serving various purposes such as communication, observation, and navigation like GPS constellations.
  3. Missions beyond these orbits aim to explore the solar system, with projects like the James Webb telescope and the Artemis mission planning to return humans to the moon after 50 years. ([Time 0:00:00](https://share.snipd.com/episode-takeaways/c31c9d91-2961-472c-bb45-cafc27a6b4f3))
- Exploring the Diversity of Satellite Orbits and Space Missions
  Summary:
  Space industry projections indicate a trillion-dollar market by the 2030s, with satellites being crucial components.
  Satellites operate in geostationary orbit, hovering over a fixed point on Earth, and low-Earth orbit, much closer to the planet. These orbits serve different purposes like communication and observation satellites.
  Additionally, mid-Earth orbits host navigation constellations like GPS.
  Beyond these orbits, there are missions to explore the solar system, like the James Webb telescope and Artemis mission planning to return humans to the moon after 50 years.

  So one question I want to start off with is, give me the baseball card on the space industry right now. What numbers get thrown around in terms of market size? How many satellites are out there today? What's in geo versus Leo versus what is Mio? We're going to do a lot of acronyms today. So what are all these things?
  Speaker 1
  There are a series of projections that say space is a trillion-dollar marketplace at some point in the 2030s. What does it translate into and what's going on today? There are two realms where satellites are most commonly used by humans. There's geostationary orbit, which is an orbit that is unique because the orbit rotates at the same rate that Earth rotates below it. So in effect, a satellite is hovering over a given point in the sky.
  Speaker 2
  And those are really far away. Geo is a, if you were to look at it relative to.
  Speaker 1
  The distance to a geostationary satellite is about six times Earth's radius. So dramatically farther out than the radius of Earth. You contrast that with a low-Earth orbit satellite. The distance to a low-Earth orbit satellite is a lot of times five, six, seven hundred kilometers above Earth's surface, which is really just about 10% of Earth's radius away. And those are two distinctly different realms that have distinctly different values, but they can be of different uses for communication satellites for observation satellites. There are also uses for space that are very popular outside of those orbits. And in between those two in mid-Earth orbit, you have a lot of position navigation and timing constellations like GPS, like Galileo over in Europe. Those are used throughout a series of industries and are really a staple in a backbone of modern life in the US. And then there's a series of missions that go beyond geostationary orbit from the farthest reaches of the solar system. If you look at the old Voyager missions to the James Webb telescope, which is at a Lagrange point looking at the universe around us, to the Artemis mission, which is aiming to put humans On the moon again for the first time in over 50 years.
