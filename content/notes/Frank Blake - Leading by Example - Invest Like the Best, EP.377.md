### Highlights

- Leadership is understanding when you make a joke people laugh and it’s not about saying things but doing things. This guy hand wrote 200 cards every Sunday to associates and told stories that related to themes le customer service didn’t put up banners. Someone asked why a man was doing a project but when he said it was a coffin for his grandson and gave him the materials free. People want to be great at service and their job but you need to give them the prompting to give a shit so they have the agency to get over the line. That’s real leadership. Clear notes and thank you. Hw bush wrote personal notes to people and it really lifted their days. Ask questions and need disagreement not just welcome it. Ragen was great at making his thinking clear so anyone in his staff new exactly how he would respond and thus how to respond to any issue. Dont think you’re funny. You need disagreement and to see from the front. Make win win deals always leave something on the table. A CEOs job is managing human and financial capital those are the only 2 decisions. In a commodity business you can still differentiate with great service think delta vs American Airlines.

    - **Note:** Leadership is about doing things and proof. People want to do the right things you just need to empower them to do it. Writing personal notes and giving clear direction. Your ideas and mission should be so clear anyone can respond on your behalf. Disagreement leading from the front b
      Be a good leader do the right thing not the easy thing. Losing money vs good service.
- Concrete Expression of Expectations
  Summary:
  Leaders need to provide concrete expression of what they expect from their organization.
  By clearly articulating and demonstrating expectations, individuals in the organization can rally around and understand what is required. Simply stating expectations without tangible actions or displays like banners is ineffective in driving the desired behavior.
  Providing concrete expressions, such as detailed memos or notes, can help employees align with organizational goals and focus on what truly matters.

  Speaker 1
  And so my next theory about this, because I did justify spending so much time on this, I had to have a theory about it. So my theory is that most people do want to do good job at what they're doing. And most leaders are surprisingly not terribly clear about it. And one of the advantages of doing something, whatever it is that you as a leader want to see throughout your organization, one of the advantages of whether it's writing notes or some People have different things than that. Doing that is it gives concrete expression to what it is that you want. Because otherwise, without that, I'll fill in the blank on what you want and by and large, I won't be right. And this gives content to it and it gives something that the organization at an individual level can understand and rally around. So if I say, as I did, customer service is going to be hugely important at Home Depot. And here's my memo on customer service. Right. I mean, seriously, what, what has that done? That's done nothing. And if I put up banners on customer service all around our break rooms and whatever, I say we're a customer service. We love customers. No one cares. Yeah. I mean, seriously, no one cares. No one cares about that. But I'll give you the first example of this was I got a great note from the leader here in Atlanta, he actually runs the largest church in Atlanta. But I got this note that I read at our big store managers meeting and it was right at the start. And the note was about a customer who sent him a note, customer of Home Depot who's going through the register and talks to the cashier. Cashier does as she's trained to do. She says, did you find everything you were looking for for your project? He says, yes, thank you. She said, what is your project? He said, I'm building coffin for my grandson. And she says, don't even think about paying. That if you're saying I want to empower associates to do right by our customers, no one's going to forget that story. It has an emotional impact and a meaning that just saying empowered to do something for your customers doesn't have. And so to me, it's very important that the notes or whatever you do, it's not just, I'd like you, you're awesome, Frank. It is you did this, it's brilliant.

    - **Note:** this is such a great story shows the power of story telling and how doing the right thing isn’t the easy thing but doing the right thing long term creates such an advantage even if you don’t optimize the transaction
