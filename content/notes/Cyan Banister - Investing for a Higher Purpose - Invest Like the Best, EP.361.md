  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I started viewing signs differently. I started viewing art differently, conversations I was having with people differently. And I realized everything around us is a projection of our perception minds. We when we're born, when we are born, we're come online with like going back to parts work and things like that. But when we're born, we come online with about four distinct systems that come online. And then through stimulus of interacting in the world, we develop a personality.
  Speaker 2
  And we think this personality is fixed. We think it can't be changed.
  Speaker 1
  But it turns out it absolutely can be changed. Many parts of it can. How I had the spiritual awakening was the realization that all the trauma in my past was a construct of my imagination. That basically, yeah, it happened. But it happened like a dream happened like a nightmare. A nightmare you wake up from and it's gone and you're relieved. You're like, oh, that was just a dream.
  Speaker 2
  What turns out trauma is also just a dream.
  Speaker 1
  Because if you can overcome it and you can get past it and you can move forward, you have to realize that that thing when you spin it up in your mind creates all kinds of hormones that get Released that shape your reality and how you see the world. We forget that we're an animal that has hormones in a mind.
  Speaker 2
  And then there's this really special thing called consciousness.
  Speaker 1
  And so I believe that consciousness is kind of like an operating system. And it brings these parts of us online that benefited us at one point that no longer benefit us. Because they have jobs, I think of them as kind of like processes that come online to assist you. They're like, cron jobs and they're like, I'm here to assist you. And we don't know to put them away and tell them that they don't have that job anymore. They don't need to do that anymore. So once I let go of this huge amount of trauma and I realized that it just didn't matter that these things happened to me in the past, what matters is literally right now.
  Speaker 5
  And you hear people say this and you're wondering what does it mean when they say this? And I always wondered it. I was like, what does it mean?
  Speaker 1
  When you have the true realization, it's almost like it's written in your DNA. What that really, really means. Then you start to let go of so much.
  Speaker 2
  And when you let go, all of a sudden you realize, oh, life isn't so hard. It's actually quite easy. And I just have to trust myself and I have to trust my intuition and I have to just be.
  Speaker 1
  And once you learned how just to be life gets a lot more simple. All of a sudden, everything you ever wished for in your life just starts coming true. It becomes effortless.
  Speaker 2
  It's really weird.
  Speaker 1
  It's really super weird. And the only thing that changed in my life was having faith in something higher than myself.
  Speaker 2
  That was it.
  Speaker 1
  This is why when you ask me like, what sort of insight or brilliance or whatever led to whatever, it's too easy for our ego mind to take credit for everything.
  Speaker 2
  Something gave me that feeling that said, you ought to go deeper into this, you ought to do this, you've got to take this risk, you've got to jump right now.
  Speaker 1
  I guarantee you, if you talk to a lot of different people, they'll say, I don't know why I did this. I just had a feeling. And I now believe thoroughly in that feeling.
  Speaker 2
  And I believe that that feeling is the universe or God, whatever word you want to put into it.
  Speaker 4
  And it helps guide me.
  Speaker 1
  And now that I don't egotistically attach myself to it, I am just a much happier person and everything is just falling into place. ([Time 0:49:08](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4a0d4803-9873-4cb8-888f-69ccca957d5d))

    - **Note:** Consciousness is being aware of the operating system you have and choosing how it’s implemented in you. Trust yourself your intuition and just be. Trauma is a dream.
- Understanding Internal Family Systems Therapy (IFS)
  Key takeaways:
  - Every part of your personality, even the ones you don't like, is there to serve you and protect you.
  - By treating different parts of your personality as separate entities and having conversations with them, you can change automatic processes and behaviors permanently.
  - Understanding that others' actions are usually not about you but about how they handle things coming at them can help you navigate interactions better.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  For people that don't know what IFS is, you basically view all your parts of your personality as there are no bad parts.
  Speaker 1
  Every part is there to serve you, including the ones you might not like.
  Speaker 2
  And they come online to serve you because they're trying to defend you and protect you yourself that's underneath all of that stuff.
  Speaker 4
  And when you start treating them as separate entities and have curiosity about them and start having conversations with them, you start to realize there are automatic processes that
  Speaker 1
  Come online that you can then give them other jobs to do. And you can change your personality permanently for the better.
  Speaker 2
  I've gotten rid of some behaviors that I thought were unchangeable through IFS, nervousness, types of nervousness, types of reactions to people talking to me and realizing that these
  Speaker 1
  Were all just automatic functions of how I show up and react to any kind of perception or stimulus in the world. And it wasn't about the person I was dealing with. It was about me.
  Speaker 4
  In general, it's usually all about how you handle anything coming at you.
  Speaker 1
  A friend of mine said something really powerful to me once, which was if people are coming with you with anything but love, it's not about you. ([Time 1:11:34](https://share.snipd.com/snip/49d40349-9bc1-42fe-b264-b264bab0bc4f))

    - **Note:** Our internal feelings like anxiety are there to help us in the world so we need to reframe those feelings to serve us. When they’re not serving us that’s a mis attribution so you just need to realign things you’re not trying to hurt yourself you’re just confused how to help yourself these are automatic functions that get triggered and you need to reprogram them so they trigger different outcomes. No bad parts of personality they’re all separate parts treat them as separate entities. They want to defend a protect your get curious about these things and talk with them. Give these stimuluses other reactions. If someone doesn’t love you it’s on them. Not being fully present is like being asleep.
