- Embrace Feedback to Enhance Leadership
  Summary:
  Obtaining candid feedback is a significant challenge for CEOs, as many individuals hesitate to provide direct criticism.
  Implementing a structured feedback mechanism can facilitate honest opinions, allowing leaders to understand both their strengths and areas for improvement. Receiving detailed input can initially boost confidence, but it often reveals substantial flaws that leaders must confront.
  This process helps maintain self-awareness and encourages growth for both founder CEOs, who may struggle with decision-making involvement and the need to delegate, and their successors, ensuring continuous improvement in leadership effectiveness.

  And it's hard for CEOs get feedback, very hard. Very few people give straight feedback to the CEO. So this was a good way to get the end was big enough that people gave very, very strong feedback. And he summarized to give you my net from our score. And then I started reading my review. And each page was different. So the first several pages were my features, and he says software development, he's like, here's your features. So page number one, you're very good at explaining HubSpot's vision. And then he pulled out quotes from the novels people wrote. Page two, page one through 10 were features, and they were great. And I was pretty confident that I was the best CEO ever invented after reading the first update. And then the bugs came. And Page 11 was the bugs and there were 12 pages of bugs. And I was pretty convinced I was the worst CEO ever invented by the end of the 12 pages. And I remember when I finished it, I'm not a scotch tricker. So I remember I poured up glass of scotch. But that mechanism for getting feedback was we still use it. So the current CEO gets the same type of a thing. And it's very, very, very useful. I think founder CEOs often have this problem that like founder CEOs like to make decisions like to be involved with the details like to drive things like to be in the middle of things.

    - **Note:** He got feedback by sending out a survey to leadership that was anonymous had an NPS and blurb about why that was written and was framed with his features and bugs to improve. he was better at working on his strengths and hiring for his weaknesses. He tried to work on a couple weaknesses, but mainly focused on getting the most leverage he could out of himself and finding people to fill the gaps. Don’t hire the board room candidate that checks the boxes hire the best fit. Interviewing process is broken because it’s all the same questions and you can’t understand what they actually want end up being tyranny of the majority. Learn into quirkiness and who you are not central casting. Authenticity gets more important with scale.
- Simplicity is the Key to Innovation
  Summary:
  Innovation thrives on simplicity by integrating complex components into a coherent system that benefits the user.
  The example of the iPod illustrates how addressing user pain points, such as the difficulty of existing MP3 players, leads to breakthroughs. Steve Jobs emphasized creating an effortless experience for consumers by combining a simple device with a freemium model via iTunes, allowing for easy music downloads.
  This principle inspired the development of HubSpot, which aimed to simplify the marketing process by unifying various tools—Google Analytics, blogs, social media tracking, SEO, and CRM—into one seamless platform.
  The approach is a testament to how breaking down intricate problems into manageable, simplified solutions can produce exponential benefits for users.

  And I remember this one day was a really good day. In the morning, we visited Apple. It was like a year after the iPod came out and it was on fire And I remember Steve walked into the auditoriums about a hundred of us and he was in a bad mood and it was pretty intimidating and I remember he looked he looked out and he basically was like what are you people doing here for business school? Like he wasn't into the whole business school thing and one of my classmates, JP Gorski, raised his hand up high and he said, we're here from Sloan School of Management and we're studying Innovation disruption. And we thought we'd learn from the best. And as Steve just melted, he liked that a lot. And then he talked about how we came up with the iPod. And kernels of this very much made it into the way we thought about HubSpot. And the iPod, the way you described was really simple. There were MP3 players before, but you had to be a real geek to use one. And very few people were buying them and you had to burn music to them as a pain in the neck to do it. And he said, I really wanted something simple. So I wanted to take an MP3 player, build a freemium app, iTunes, and then work with the record companies and enable you to download a song for 99 cents a song and he said that's a one plus One plus one equals 10 for the consumer. And that was how we originally came up with HubSpot like a marketer in that day and age putting Google Analytics and a blog and social media tracking tools and SEO tools and marketing Automation CRM and all this stuff. And it was complicated. It was a big hairy problem. And so we use that analogy very much that Steve used, like, how do we make an all one system where the one plus one plus one will equal 10 across all the systems. So the morning was really influential. And then that afternoon, our kids were in business school. We visited a little startup called Salesforce.com and their CEO, Mark Benioff. That day was really formative in thinking about HubSpot. ([Time 0:21:16](https://share.snipd.com/snip/bb7ac309-2cb0-4418-b376-ef1940a89771))
    - **Note:** Building a product that creates a 1+1+1=10 situation where a few features come together fo give global leverage.
- Trust Your Instincts Before It's Too Late
  Summary:
  Recognizing when to move on from someone in a professional context is crucial and often tied to initial thoughts or feelings about that person.
  Once the contemplation arises, it may be best to act quickly, as the likelihood of changing one's mind is slim. This approach aligns with conventional wisdom in leadership circles, where decisive action is encouraged.
  However, there are differing philosophies on handling underperformance, such as using public accountability to motivate improvement instead of outright termination.
  Despite established best practices, notable CEOs like Jensen of Nvidia and Elon Musk often defy conventional norms, raising questions about the efficacy of these guidelines and suggesting that instinct and individual style may play a more significant role in successful leadership than traditionally accepted methods.

  How do you know when it's time to move on from somebody? I guess in a way you've either made the wrong hire or it's the wrong environment for that person to succeed or however you want to phrase that. But how do you recognize that? I had a CEO the other day tell me he's like the moment you start thinking about it, that's the moment to act on it. I've never seen anybody change their mind from that initial thought. How do you think about that? What's your reaction to that?
  Speaker 1
  Unfortunately, I feel like that's conventional wisdom and I think it largely puts with what I've seen. I rarely change my mind on people in that kind of context. And everyone says, when you know you should move quickly, I never have. They call me weak.
  Speaker 2
  Have you ever regretted not moving quickly? It's interesting to contrast that to Jensen, who's been talking recently about, he doesn't really fire people. He berates them into being better in a public way. B-rate is probably the wrong word, but he wants to pull you towards excellence rather than fire you. But I don't think that's practical for most people or most organizations.
  Speaker 1
  So you and I both sat through the same Jensen presentation. Yeah. So I spent a lot of time thinking about CEOism and coaching CEOs. And there's sort of like a set of best practices for being a CEO. It's almost like a CEO unofficial school. What's confusing about the CEO school that's been around for a long time is Arguably the two I'm not gonna say best but two amazing CEOs are Jensen Nvidia in Elon. It's basics and that's a and they Completely ignored almost everything about CEO school, CEO lessons, CEO best practices. And I find that fascinating.
