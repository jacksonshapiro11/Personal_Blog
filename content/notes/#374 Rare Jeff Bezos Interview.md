  Jeff Bezos
  You know, Blue Origin is not a very good business yet, but I think at one point, from my financial returns point of view, it's going to be the best business that I've ever been involved In, bigger than Amazon. And so this follow-up question was excellent. Where do you think your confidence comes from to create a business that requires such scale? Most people want to be able to see where they're going. In the case of Amazon, in the case of space, you cannot see where you're going. This is excellent. Bezos says, one observation I would have is that I think it's genuinely human nature to overestimate risk and underestimate opportunity. And so I think entrepreneurs in general would be well advised to try and bias against that piece of human nature. The risks are probably not as big as you perceive, and the opportunities may be bigger than you perceive. You say it's confidence, but maybe it's just trying to compensate for that, accepting that that is a human bias and trying to compensate against it. The second thing I would say is that thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. So then Sorkin asks a follow-up question. Where do you think you learned this? This is something a wise old man would say. I remember watching you on 60 Minutes in like 1999, and they were asking you whether this whole thing, whether Amazon could work out or not. And you said, it's not a fear that it can't work. It's a fact that it might not work. And so Bezos talks about the very early days of Amazon. And I've heard this story before, but I absolutely love it. He said, I sold 20% of the company for a million dollars. It took 50 meetings to raise that money. And the most common question at the time was, what is the internet? The whole enterprise could have been extinguished then in those meetings. I would always tell people that I thought there was a 70% chance they would lose their investment. And then the follow-up question from Sorkin was also great here. What do you think the real odds are with Blue Origin? Bezos says Blue Origin doesn't have the same level of financing risk because I can finance Blue Origin with my Amazon stock. Blue Origin has a lot of runway. And then they're going to start to discuss something that Bezos brings up a few times, which is really how you want to think about your wealth.
