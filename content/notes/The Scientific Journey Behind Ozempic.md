### Highlights

- Episode AI notes
  1. The mechanism of weight loss medication such as GLP-1 works by increasing insulin levels, lowering glucagon levels, and slowing down food absorption in the intestines to stabilize blood sugar levels.
  2. These medications help people eat less, resulting in reduced calorie intake and weight loss, primarily by targeting the brain and affecting hunger, satiety, and reward systems.
  3. Studies indicate that the majority of the effect of weight loss medication is in the brain, leading to better control of eating behaviors, especially against savory foods like burgers.
  4. Overall, weight loss medications work by influencing various mechanisms in the body and brain to promote weight loss and improve metabolic health. ([Time 0:00:00](https://share.snipd.com/episode-takeaways/317804a9-b2d1-47dc-811e-f01da51df3b4))
- The Mechanism of Weight Loss Medication
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  You said, no, of course, we know why it works. I would love to dive into that. Knowing that our audience is primarily a smart technical business savvy logical audience, but you know, it doesn't have the science background in diabetes, where the disease is that
  Speaker 1
  You have your blood sugar is too high.
  Speaker 7
  Their GOP one works by increasing the levels of insulin, which then gets the glucose down.
  Speaker 1
  At the same time, it also lowers the level of glucagon, which is kind of the opposite to insulin. And that means that there are two mechanisms that play at the same time, at both lead to a lowering of blood glucose. That's also safety built into that because the mechanism stops working when glucose is normalized. So you can't really get too much of it. It also has an effect on your intestine so that food is absorbed slower, which then helps to not get too much excursions in blood glucose after you eat. Of course, when you eat, you have your blood sugar will go up and then it will eventually go down again. That means that there are actually three mechanisms that play for how GOP one works to treat diabetes.
  Speaker 3
  So and then what we were emailing about was the obesity effect, or the anti obesity effect. The effect that helps people lose weight, whether it is in patients with diabetes or in people with obesity or in your other diseases.
  Speaker 1
  Then the way that these GOP one agents work is that they help people to eat less. You simply consume less calories when you are on this medicine. And I think we have a really good understanding on, for example, going from lerakotide to semagotide, where you get approximately twice as much weight loss. You also have approximately twice as much reduction in energy intake. So with lerakotide, it's like 15% of reduction in energy intake. Then it's about 30% with semagotide. So that is how it works when you look at it from the patient side of point of view. But then you can of course go 12 further into that mechanism as I was just doing in diabetes with insulin and glucagon and gastric emptying.
  Speaker 6
  And then you can say, okay, which organ does it work on?
  Speaker 1
  And here it really is the brain.
  Speaker 6
  But of course, you have to go to and accept some animal studies in order to understand the mechanism further.
  Speaker 1
  Because in animals, you know, you can separate, you know, which receptors are in in the lower part, the peripheral part of the body, or which are in the brain. And then you can make animal studies to show that it's happening in the brain. When people are saying we don't know how it works, then they refer to the animal studies, because there are actually so many places that you'll be one works in the brain. And it has effects both on hunger systems, on satiety systems, but also on the reward system, which is like how you want food, how you like food, how you maybe dislike food. And that's what they mean when they say, you know, we don't know where to work, we don't know exactly which part of the brain and how much for that part of the brain, how much for another Part of the brain.
  Speaker 7
  But we do know that the majority of it is in the brain.
  Speaker 1
  And then from the patient point of view or the people with obesity, then we just know that it's because they eat less calories when they're on this medicine. They also have the better kind of control of eating. And we've investigated that in people, right, where they are asked to rate how well do you feel that you can control how much you eat. And you can even see that it looks like it actually works well against savory food, which is, for example, burgers, and things like that. And then we also know in people with obesity that that's how it works. So I would say, you know, we know how it works.
  Speaker 3
  But of course, there's always details, you know, I could go on and explain new stuff about what happens in the brain for the next 30 minutes, if you have time.
  Speaker 5
  Well, actually, one thing I was curious on that, I may have even said on the episode, but I wasn't qualified enough to know for sure. Because natural GLP one has such a short half-life, is natural GLP one present in the brain in, you know, less or less quantities than lyric luteid or semaglutid is because those obviously
  Speaker 4
  Have a much longer half-life. ([Time 0:33:37](https://share.snipd.com/snip/75f5881c-c203-427c-a93d-8963743f59a3))

    - **Note:** How glp 1s work they basically tell the brain to stop eating and the brain listens. Works to shut down food desire. There is a lot we don’t know about metabolic health but eating less does help lose weight
