      Non consensus and right back by his deep understanding and unique differentiation
- Was a lawyer quit needed to work for himself. Needed to work for himself and quit after his first child was born.
  Jay pritzker was an influential real estate person who wanted to hire Sam. Sam only worked for himself but offered to partner. Learning from an experienced entrepreneur defined his future. Work with people you trust only.
  There is usually 1-2 variables that matter of all your assumptions focus on those the rest is noise. Find the 1 thing that defines returns.
  Sam when he brought a property realized the Hawaiian technique the sum of the parts greater than the whole. The land the building the deed ect all had their own value usually at a discount to price.
  When you dress funny and do well you’re eccentric when you do ok and dress funny you’re a shmuck. They never conformed.
  They were asset rich and had dry powered to buy the great deals when everything collapsed keep dry powder and take from forced sellers. Grave dancing strategy. He was issuing fixed Debt in inflationary environment.

    - **Note:** Sam could only work for himself and would partner if need be but needed independence entrepreneurial spirit. He kept dry powder for the down times and invested heavily when it was cheap. Work with people you trust.
      2 techniques the Hawaiian technique which is valuation of the parts for the whole which are usually discounted and then finding they key assumptions that make or sink you leverage points. This is a munger idea too.
      Don’t be a schmuck vs eccentric
- He realized he was making money in one business and then thought he had the right process to go outside of real estate and still generate returns. He was very successful it’s all process focused.
  He saw his job as an opportunist
  Realized there was a lot of places with bad management wanted to be in low competition rather than high
  His partner died at 46 from cancer you never know how fast your life can flip. At this time his company almost went bankrupt due to a recession. Liquidity = life.
  He invited the reit
  At 53 he was almost bankrupt his partner was dead and he had been divorced twice. Don’t be surprised if your best idea comes after decades of experience.
  Everyday you get quoted an asset you’re choosing to buy or sell it. Mr market. Sam had no attachments outside of buying things cheap and selling things expensive. This lead to him doing the biggest real estate business deal with black stone in 2008.
  Understand your skill set and optimize your life for it
  Connectedness of the world gives more reach.
  Fate lies in ourselves
  Trade time for money.
  Fast decision and autonomy are oxygen to people they want to think critically.
  Consumes a ton of info.
