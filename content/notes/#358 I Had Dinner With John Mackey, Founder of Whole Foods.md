  She says, that sounds fantastic. Let's do it. And almost 50 years later in the future, right, he's looking back at this time, he's writing these words almost 50 years after they happen. And he says that those three words, let's do it, were some of the most important moments in his life. And what he's going to describe here in the book is this idea that reappears over and over again at the beginning of something. And new ideas are fragile and they- they- they- new ideas need friends. I am forever in her debt for the way she responded when I first gave voice to my dream. I was inspired and excited, but also full of hesitation and self-doubt. If she had been cautious or dismissive, I might never have entertained the idea again. So I was able to talk to John about this at dinner and he just said he's like I had a drive to create something to build something to make a mark. It was an inner drive. Nobody was telling him that he should do that. In fact, in many cases, as you know, most people around you tell you not to do that. Don't be different. Take the safer route. Get a job. Don't be this weird entrepreneurial rebel. But that inner voice will not be silenced by anything else but action. And so even though he's only 23 years old at the time, he's never run a business. He takes this very seriously. This was a mission to him. He says, I took it seriously. I really did believe that the foods and supplements we'd be selling would offer our customers a better chance of staying safe and healthy.

    - **Note:** He needed people to believe and support him he felt called to build something hated reading for school and dropped out went to work at an organic food store thought he could do it and this launched WF. So many people tell you not to to take the safe route not the leap but he took the leap and gave it he’ll. They kept getting shut down by the inspectors so they built at night when the inspectors were asleep. They couldn’t wait they needed to move fast. They had to sleep in the office they didn’t have money for a house. His dad became his mentor important of mentorship and helped him develop his personal circulum. Voracious reader and consumer. He realized the industry was growing and he needed to move fast to take advantage thought it would be saturated in 2 years. He made secret allies in the space who helped him pool buying power and learned the trade. He would acquire many of these people.
- Forged by Adversity: The Cost of a Lost Generation
  Summary:
  The narrative illustrates the impact of historical events on individual life choices, emphasizing that those who grew up during the Great Depression and World War II had to prioritize survival and responsibility over personal aspirations.
  This generation came of age amidst hardship, resulting in a mindset that discouraged the pursuit of dreams and passions. Instead, they focused on rebuilding society and fulfilling familial and societal duties, which shaped their identities and values.

  Him and his father together because he was very, very different. He just grew up completely different from both of his parents. So I want to give you a little background there too, because I think it will enhance your understanding of the story. My father had grown up during the Great Depression and when Pearl Harbor was bombed by the Japanese in 1941, he was just 20 years old. He wasted no time joining the military and marrying my mom. His generation had to grow up fast. They had no time to indulge youthful dreams or ponder the meaning of life. They had to rebuild a country devastated by the depression and war. He had not, my father had not followed his own passions in life. That simply wasn't what people did in that era. ([Time 0:18:24](https://share.snipd.com/snip/eba0a798-d870-4977-b78b-71f7d7bb6121))
    - **Note:** Some people cannot pursue the good life or think of the meaning of life. Hard times create strong men.
- Success Requires Timing, Skill, and Resilience
  Summary:
  Launching a business at the right time with the right pricing can create a perception of abundance, leading to immediate customer interest and sales.
  Whole Foods Market exemplified this, experiencing profitability almost instantly on its opening day due to high sales volumes. However, entrepreneurship involves navigating emotional highs and lows, as success can be followed by unexpected challenges, such as natural disasters that threaten operational stability.

  Sold it at the special opening week price of 99% per gallon. Customers felt like they were getting a really good deal and it created a convincing illusion that the store was filled to the brim. On September 20th, 1980, at 9 a.m. We opened. You're gonna see right from the very beginning, this is the right place, the right time, with the right person, with the right set of skills. How long did it take until Whole Foods Market first became profitable? I would answer only half jokingly until about two o'clock in the afternoon on the first day. Our sales far exceeded expectations and they never slowed down. We became the highest volume natural food store in the United States doing over $200,000 per week. It was the right place, the right timing, and the right type of store. Imagine the euphoria that you would feel if you were in John's shoes. The amount of time, effort, energy, love, and risk that you took and it was an unbelievable success from day one but you know that entrepreneurs, the entrepreneurial emotional roller Coaster is euphoria terror. They open up and less than a year later, Austin, Texas gets hit by torrential downpours that cause what they call a once in a hundred year flood.

- Resilience in the Face of Adversity
  Summary:
  Faced with an unprecedented flood that devastated their store, the community rallied together to support its recovery.
  Despite the enormity of the disaster, characterized by eight feet of contaminated water and significant financial loss, the owner refused to succumb to despair. Instead, he began the arduous task of cleaning up, inspiring others to pitch in unrequested.
  This collective effort highlighted the deep connection between the store and its patrons, showcasing the power of community support in overcoming challenges.
  Additionally, through a personal relationship with a local banker, the owner secured a crucial loan that was personally guaranteed, emphasizing the importance of trust and support in times of crisis.
  This experience revealed not only the resilience required to rebuild but also the indispensable role of community in the survival and revival of a business.

  They open up and less than a year later, Austin, Texas gets hit by torrential downpours that cause what they call a once in a hundred year flood. A hundred year flood hits them in their first year of existence. The water broke through the windows like a tidal wave, deluging the store. It was the worst flood that Austin had seen in seven decades. Thirteen people died. The store had been eight feet underwater. All of our equipment and inventory would need to be replaced. We estimated the inventory alone was worth about $400,000 and virtually all of it was financed by our suppliers. I started to feel much older than my 27 years. Before the flood I had really felt as if this was why I was on earth. This is what I was here to do. This is what I was meant to do. But now he's saying, well, I can think that all I want. But then nature delivers eight feet of water. Nature puts my store up to eight feet of water. And it's not just that it's water. When there's floods, that means the sewers overflowed and mixed with the floodwaters. And so his entire store is full of fecal matter. So what do you do? He's got no, he has no idea how he's going to get out of this. But he's like, okay, what am I going to do? I'm not going to just sit here. So he just starts getting to work. Eventually the waters recede, and they grab a bucket, and he starts mopping. And here's the insane thing. And this idea that what you've made is, you know, loved by other people. And he notices a guy that's doing the same thing that's on another aisle of the store, mopping. And he's like, I thought I knew everybody that worked here. So he goes, hey, I'm sorry. I don't remember your name. I'm John. And he goes, hey, I'm Larry. I live down the street. I'm off work today, so I thought I'd come by and help clean up. I love this store. I shop here all the time, and I want to make sure that you guys come through this. And Larry wasn't alone. As the day wore on, more and more volunteers showed up. They came uninvited and unpaid. For no reason other than they loved the store and didn't want to see it fail. And this is just a first in a series of people that helped John and lend him a hand. And if they didn't, Whole Foods probably wouldn't exist because they didn't have flood insurance. So the first thing he does, even though he's owes his suppliers a bunch of monies, it's like, well, you know, if we go out of business, we're not going to pay you. Can you front us some inventory? They agree. Then he goes down to his local bank, Citi National, and he explains it to his local banker, this guy named Mark Monroe. And Mark Monroe agrees to give him a $100,000 loan. Now there's a crazy story. Years later, when the loan was long paid off, I learned the reason the application process had been so easy. A stranger approached me at a conference and shook my hand. John, you won't remember me, but I used to work at City National Bank. That was quite a thing that Mark Monroe did for you after that big flood. The bank didn't approve that loan. The turned it down. Mark Monroe personally guaranteed that loan for you. That's the reason you got the money. I was stunned. Mark had never set a work. Only four weeks after the flood, we reopened.

- Strategic Ambition Outlasts Store Quality
  Summary:
  Success in retail is driven not by having the best stores but by strategic ambition and a focus on long-term profitability.
  Whole Foods Market thrived by being more ambitious, frugal, and profit-oriented compared to competitors, even as high-quality products failed to create sustainable business success. The emergence of Walmart supercenters reshaped the grocery landscape, causing traditional grocery stores to pursue lower pricing strategies rather than responding strategically, highlighting the importance of evolution and adaptability in the retail industry.

  Or maybe even the later half of the Whole Foods history. I do want to wrap up just this expansion, this how he worked himself and his company into the most dominant position in their industry. And so there's a paragraph I want to read to you that's his writing, and I'll summarize this because I think these principles are timeless and applicable to almost every single one of Us. I think that's why Whole Foods Market emerged out of that first generation as the only dominant national company, buying up all those other brands. It wasn't because we had the best stores. It was because, that's such an important part, it wasn't because we had the best stores. It was because we were more ambitious and thought strategically about the long term. We ran our business frugally and our stores to be highly profitable and we weren't ambivalent about either money or growth. So we didn't win because we had the best stores. The best stores are the best products. If you think about the store as an actual product, right? What's crazy about this industry is the best products were actually losing money. They had the highest quality stores, but they weren't running good businesses as the way to think about that. We won because we were more ambitious. We were more strategic. We were more focused on the long term. We were more frugal. And we were more on profit. Now there's two things John said when we were together that blew my mind. One, he says that Walmart was one of the keys to success for Whole Foods. And this was crazy to think about. Why? Because the super centers that they started opening up, right, they caused grocery stores. So now Walmart goes from a normal retailer to, you can buy every single thing that you want, including groceries in our super centers. So their super centers cause grocery stores to keep going down market over price, which means when the Walmart super centers first appeared and Costco, the same first appeared on the Scene the grocery stores, their initial reaction was wrong. ([Time 1:07:20](https://share.snipd.com/snip/effc926b-38a6-4385-b0ea-8c7d39f25c16))
    - **Note:** Whole Foods won because they just rapidly expanded and that’s why he won. They weren’t the best they grew the fastest. He didn’t control his costs which led him to lose control of his company and forced the Amazon sale. He didn’t want to sell but this was his baby he was going to lose control to PE because they didn’t control their costs so he wanted to find a better steward of the business and found Amazon. They bought after 2 days. He left in 2022 after 44 years he really struggled with the sale he needed therapy and mdma to process this but it was very hard. He had to sell but regretted it. Sees business as an infinite game and he’s constantly playing forever.
