  Speaker 1
  You bet. But as usual, I was much too macho to show it. And I did have $10 million this compensation to her my feeling for compensation for my hurt feelings. If they had told me we have another job for you, I would have done it in a second. I was willing. This is so important. I double underline the sentence. I was willing to do anything that they wanted. It was a great organization. I would have been happy to stay. I and this is another important sentence. I would have never left voluntarily. Afterward, I didn't sit around wondering what was happening at the old firm. I didn't go back and visit. I never look over my shoulder once finished gone. Life continues. And then he makes the point, OK, it's 1981. I got $10 million. It's a good amount of money. I don't ever have to work if I don't want to. Like I could play it easy. Obviously right from the beginning, we see that's just not his personality type at all. And he does something that that was considered odd at the time. He decides I'm going to start my own company, my own startup. And a lot of people were obsessed with the prestige of working for a large company. You have this expense account. Michael goes into detail. He's all throughout his twenties and thirties. He's able to travel the world. Salomon brothers is picking up the check. He's working 12 hour days, but he's also partying, constantly entertaining clients. He says he this goes back to this this reoccurring theme in the book that he's unapologetically extreme. He was like, no, I they tell you don't burn the candle of both ends. ([Time 0:12:40](https://share.snipd.com/snip/46d117b1-0a71-4ad9-86c5-c311e8aa9344))
    - **Note:** He’s working 12 hour days 6 days a week burning then candle at both ends. Gets fired from Salomon brothers after 15 years $10mm pay day he doesn’t regret he moved on despite being really sad. No use in lingering. 30 year old mike goes to start his own data company people pitied him but he was more concerned about what his wife and 2 young kids thought. He would’ve never left Salomon if he had the choice. He realized what business he was in the data business Kodak thought they were in the film business when they were really in the photography business. Unapologetically extreme with deep inner drive. Time filters out all the bs and fakers. Street smarts and common sense are the greatest predictors of success. He saw sales and trading as doing direct to customers understanding them and winning business vs banking sitting behind a desk all day. He called Salomon because he needed a job and didn’t know what he wanted and instantly loved it.

  Speaker 1
  Um, and so we're going to clearly see this is Bloomberg saying, what is this? He's writing these words, you know, 50 years after this happened, maybe 40 years, whatever the time is clearly this guy had to have any influence on it. So he says he was decisive and consistent as a leader. If he ever harbored doubts after making a decision, I never saw it. He was easily approachable and willing to listen to everyone's views. But when he said we were going left, we went left. And when he said, right, right, it was, we didn't have to prepare for both directions. He set the rules. So he's open to a discussion. He wants to hear your ideas, but he's the, he's the, he's the box office. He's the one that's going to make the decisions by say left, we're going left. This is again, very, very common history of entrepreneurship. But also what he does here is like there's, this is a really important paragraph. There were no different set of rules for him leading from the front is essentially what Michael is telling us, right? He led by example what he said he, what he said he did and the rest of us did as well. And so now he brings in the second person. He worked for John. John was a great leader too. This also the kind of fires them later on. John was a great leader too. But I always thought he listened to too many people. Okay. So this is crazy. Really, I would summarize this as more egalitarian, but less effective is John. Billy trusted his own judgment. I'm open to ideas, but I'm going to make the decision. And we know founders have to trust their own judgment. You got to work yourself into position. It's very clear where you can actually trust your own judgment because you're the ultimate person making decisions. No one can do it for you. It made running the firm much more difficult for him. Smart people prepared for both left and right when John succeeded Billy. This event, this split resources and made it harder to lead when the, when the going got tough, unlike Billy. So now here comes the contrast and we can clearly see from like, if you read between the lines below Michael saying, like, he's clear as saying this is a mistake. I'm going to be the ultimate decision maker at Bloomberg. Unlike Billy, John consulted all interested parties before making a decision. No matter how noble the motive, the resulting apparent indecisiveness. Oh, that, that, that resulted in apparent indecisiveness. Comparing John to, to Billy on leadership, I always thought John was more egalitarian but less effective. And so Bloomberg is kind of starting at the bottom of this organization. And you see that he's really too embarrassed to tell his peers, his, the fellow graduates of Harvard. The truth. And so he says, I worked my first summer there in the cage, physically counting securities by hand. It was a pretty lowly start. We slaved in our underwear in an unair conditioned bank fault with an occasional six pack of beer to make it more bearable. When my friends asked what I was doing at work to save face, I told them I was studying methods and procedures to simplify the workflow. My friends were research analysts and investment bankers with lush private offices. And I was what I can only be called a clerk in his underwear. No less. Why didn't I quit? I was too embarrassed to quit. So Mike's learning the value of sales. He also is learning the value of the thrill that you feel, feel when you're really good at your job. And then this is going to be really interesting that I've seen a couple of times get to one second billion job would stand over me watching silently while I was on the phone with the customer Heads down, totally focused on making the sale, talking, explaining, cajoling, pleading. I felt a great thrill when I had closed the deal. They would walk away without a word. There weren't any congratulations. They weren't needed. I was expected to make big trades. So a few months ago, I read this book, the general genius, which is about the Manhattan Project, which I before I read the book thought Robin Arman, hyper Jay, Robert Oppenheimer was The lead on that project. I didn't know he actually worked for General Leslie Groves. Leslie Groves was the same way. He's like, I'm not giving you congratulations on something you're supposed to do. I've been listening to a few of these interviews with, uh, I read this, this article, this post, I was really interesting by Frank Slootman, which I guess he's, he's run like three different Technology companies. I think he's like either turn around or taken public in the last like 10 years, something like that, maybe 20 years. I forgot the exact timeframe, but he has this great post called amp it up. ([Time 0:23:19](https://share.snipd.com/snip/35bc6f11-3b2e-45f4-8908-832b68195863))
    - **Note:** Billy Salomon was his boss who was open to listening to others but was clearly the ultimate decision maker. When he said go left the company went left. Gudfriend listened to too many and was indecisive. Leaders need to lead and lead from the front. Mikes first job was counting securities in a room so hot he needed to be in his underwear. He slowly worked into sales. When he did a big trade he didn’t get congratulations it was his job. High intensity. The best way to get rich is to build a business and make a product customers love. He came in first and left last and that’s how he developed relationships with the leadership because he was the only one there to talk with. He loved it too so it was easy. Showing up working hard staying flexible and loving what you do. He worked harder than anyone but never had a grand plan and let it get in the way of living his life. To win you need to string together small advances until you compound an advantage don’t try to hit moon shots. Take lots of chances and make a lot of individual spur of the moment decisions central planning never works. 5 year plans don’t work. Small earned steps. Everything compounds find work that feels like play. If you don’t what you do it negatively compounds.
- The Virtuous Flywheel and Optimizing for Learning over Money in Careers
  Key takeaways:
  - The importance of enjoying and loving one's work for long-term success
  - The detrimental effects of hating one's job and its impact on success
  - The significance of prioritizing learning over immediate monetary gains in early career
  - The advice to join the best firm possible and focus on listening and learning
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And then you'll want to do even more because of the rewards and so on. And so he's talking this virtuous, like flywheel effect, right? And so on, I've always loved my work and put in a lot of time, which has helped me make, have, make me successful. I truly pity people who don't like their jobs. They struggle at work so unhappily for ultimately so much less success and thus develop even more reason to hate. Now he's talking about the negative flywheel. If you don't love what you do, that's actually really smart. So it's going to go back to the beginning. They struggle at work so unhappily for ultimately so much less success and thus develop even more reason to hate occupations. There's, there's too much delightful stuff to do in this short lifetime, not to love getting up on a weekday morning. Okay, so that's the end of that section. I absolutely loved that. I mean, that took place on over three pages and I had a ton of highlights just from those three pages. I really liked Dave Visey's giving here. Now he's got some advice for young people, which I thought was really smart too. Some young people starting their careers today are too impatient for current compensation at the expense of continuing their education and giving their jobs a chance. Get back to work, forget the money today. There's plenty of time for that later. Navices should go to the best firm they can get into and then listen and learn. So what is he saying there? He's saying optimize for learning over money and you'll make more money in the future if you do that, right? ([Time 0:36:58](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7399e8b2-06c5-4e9f-a337-c0f227ee979c))
    - **Note:** Optimize for learning over money and over the long term you’ll make more money. Learn from the smart people at the company. He wanted to get in early and practice hard loved competing. 80% is showing up. He worked in IT at Salomon when he got fired he had the deep fire to start something new to create. Was willing to risk everything to be successful and understood his niche better than anyone what do you know better than anyone else. Stop of over analyzing and just build and take a step forward learn by doing. He broke down tasks into what everyone could do that was small. He just keeps pushing building a good product and sales then understand what you’re selling don’t fool yourself into thinking you’re in another business. Spent 4mm of his 10mm. By endurance we conquer. Start up is euphoria and terror mixed. He was convinced he was doing something no one else could do or was even trying. Don’t build an undifferentiated product theil.

  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  He's like, Hey, you want a job? And so he winds up hiring him literally all his job is critique and critique our products. So then you're, when you do that, you're helping them get better. And then like a decade or two later, that guy winds up being the president of Sony. It's one of the most remarkable things I've ever read in 90s books. And we're going to see a similar situation, kind of like the same idea here. Marils, not only are they're customer, but they're giving Bloomberg an investment. And so they put on two traders because the traders are the ones that are using the product. And he says, well, when we first installed at Merrill assigned two traders to work with us, I thought they'd be real pains and they would second guess us every step of the way. Was I wrong? It turned out both of them were as responsible for our success as anyone. And why is that? Because they were nitpickers, but not in a nasty way. They wanted us to succeed. When they said something didn't work, they could show us it didn't work. So we knew for sure it didn't work. And more important, they would help fix the problem because they would tell us under what specific, specific circumstances it didn't work every day. Our system got better as we fixed each problem. They pointed out, I'd always rather have a smart, fair, honest, demanding client than a nasty dummy. So he says, for our first, this is really just a reminder that at the beginning, you're going to be doing everything yourself. For the first three or four years in business, I did all of these functions. I worked full time selling our services. I negotiated all of our contracts. ([Time 0:50:34](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f32582ff-9a43-47b7-ae11-03e2f544a64b))
    - **Note:** Importance of having good clients he worked with 2 traders at Merrill who critquoed his product harsh but honestly and they were key to the company success. Early on mike did everything in the company. Selling service and negotiating contracts. He was hiring everyone installing the equitment even emptying the trash. These were his best days in the company. Always selling his product you need to be the best salesperson. How can you repurpose your data to compound your advantage Mike used the Bloomberg data to create media and compound their advantage all to sell more subscriptions. What advantage do you have that your competition doesn’t with news they had terminal revenues so the distillation of that in news was a marketing expense. Anti acquisition builders not buyers more fun and less risky. Bloomberg used each news story as a product demo that showed where to get the info from the terminal.

  Each news story is a product demo. More demos lead to more revenue, more revenue leads to more stories, and then even more revenue. And then he just gives us a simple like formula as an entrepreneur. I've learned to know what I don't know to get access to the people who do know and then study hard. And then he goes back to this idea of knowing what you like, what is the purpose of your business? What is the actual, what is the actual product or service that you provide your customers? So I referenced this earlier. Let's go over again. When we first began, we manufactured computers and keyboards because we had to personal computers didn't really exist in order to deliver our product. So we made them because that's how we delivered our product, but we never made a mistake of believing that we were in the hardware business. We are in the business of producing and distributing the world's most accurate, reliable, comprehensive information and analysis. That has been our mission from day one and it has never changed. Technology will continue. Makes an important point here. Technology will continuously revolutionize distribution. But our product is content and much of that content sits behind the media world's most expensive paywall. And so that's where he says it's $22,000 that works out to $88 a day. So now he's going to give us advice on how do you make your product or your company stand out and his advice is you got to be you. You know more about your business than anyone else. You think about it more, you care about it more. You're in the best position then if those facts are accurate to tell other people why it's valuable and it doesn't you don't have to be this like polished speaker. Charisma definitely helps. There is some kind of weird like hypnotic effect that charisma has on people. We see that throughout history, right? In good and bad people. But you just tell them why. People want to know why like why did you make it? Why is it valuable? What does it do? And so he says entrepreneurs in the booming 1980s were commonplace. My company was small and virtually anonymous. Our product, which was the terminal that we're selling was called the market master. It could have been confused with a kitchen appliance with that name. No one knew us. No one cared about me. But by 1984, this is about to change. Those are the days when Ronald Reagan proved how marketable ideas could be when they were peddled with charisma. You needed a spokesperson for mass appeal, consumers and the media identified products and policies with people who pitched them. So he gave an example. Nike didn't just make sneakers. It pushed them with a mystique that could only come from Michael Jordan. To have the best mouse trap wasn't enough. Success was delivered by people promotion. If we were going to build our business, we too needed a personality. The obvious choice was me. Our competitors founders were all dead. I on the other hand was alive and out making speeches and sales calls every day. Turning my name and work into a great weapon that others in the financial news and market data businesses could not match. And since I spent so much time demonstrating our product, people had begun to mentally interchange me with the terminal. So that's why he changes it from market master terminal to the Bloomberg terminal. And then the company also had a different name. It was like it was some basic name, like innovative market solutions or something like that. So he's like, well, that doesn't make sense. ([Time 1:02:13](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c8a9a322-3fdd-41cc-b529-b3df13c93957))
    - **Note:** Understand what you’re selling. You know more about your business than anyone else make it stand out. Success is driven by or people promotion like Nike and Jordan. Bloomberg makes himself the spokesperson for his company he was always trying to sell and become visible. Just use roundabout ways to get in front of customers. When starting new markets he throws creative people in the deep end see who swims and then gives them the leadership of the project. He was an information company his work with computer systems in the 1960s set the table for Bloomberg he saw at Salomon the huge advantage information had compounding benefits thst put them 10 years ahead always invest in technology and the future embrace technology don’t run from it. Hire a players and give them freedom.
- Andrew Carnegie's Idea: Investing in Technology for Business Advancement
  Key takeaways:
  - Invest in the latest technology to gain an edge over competitors
  - Find talented individuals and give them freedom in management
  - Combine software, sales, and content marketing for success
  - Invest in human capital and leverage it for maximum returns
  - Maintain an aggressive and war-like posture
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So the way I summarize Andrew Carnegie's idea is that you need to always invest in the latest technology for your business. This is why the savings compound, it gives you an edge over your slower moving competitors and can be the difference between a profit and a lost. And so think about what he just said for a decade, Salomon had a tool, a technology no one else did. So they're showing up to a fight. You got a knife. I got a gun. That's the second part of Carnegie saying it gives you an advantage over slower moving competitors. It's the same idea. Something that Bloomberg's going to preach to you about management is find the very smartest people that you can find the most talented people on your company and then give them freedom. And he says, I always believe that management's ability to influence work habits through edict is unlimited. And then he just has one sentence here. And really this sentence spawn a thought. I was like, oh, he's given us a blueprint for a modern company. We should combine software, sales and content marketing. And so this one sentences says we have phenomenally low turnover for a company employing many young programmers, salespeople and reporters. So those are the three areas in returns of humans, like human capital, human resources he's investing in software. It gives you leverage sales, gives you leverage, content marketing, gives you leverage. And then he goes right back into this aggressive war-like posture that he has throughout the book. ([Time 1:13:08](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3ba9fc49-495c-4f57-b677-af7bfb8d87f8))
    - **Note:** Keep hold of your people software sales and content marketing gives you leverage. Always fighting for market share relentless and always scared of losing share. Don’t build me too products. Makes little small bets instead of moonshots and keys them develop. Limited downside uncapped upside. We need to talk and communicate with others. Don’t enter fair fights always go in with an advantage. The world is dominated by power laws be the best only play games with the edge. Relationships with others is vital and more important than money. Rewards go to those who outwork others.
