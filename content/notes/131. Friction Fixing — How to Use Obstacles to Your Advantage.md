  That's a hard thing to do. It's that moral elevation you talked about. Exactly. Wow. Final question. What are the first three ingredients that go into a successful communication recipe?

It's one of the things that matters a lot to me. The three things are the first stage is surprise. Al, what's that again? You've already hooked them with something new and now. And then you've immediately got to make sure it's familiar, not alien. So should immediately be followed by aha. I got it. Hopefully the third step is ha ha, you laugh.
  Speaker 2
