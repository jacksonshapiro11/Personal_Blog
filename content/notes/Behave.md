### Highlights

- Cheating in cheating studies happens easiest by just not cheating deep morality coded for virtue ethics that make you do the right things without thinking. When you think you bend the truth. Make the right the easier thing.
    - **Tags:** #make-it-easy/hard, #default-decision, #virtue-ethics, #cheating
    - **Note:** Make doing the right thing the default easy thing
- Culture has a huge impact on genes and behavior. Culture is how we do and think about things transmitted by non genetic means. Collectivist vs individual cultures. Group oriented vs internally focused. Relational vs categorical view. The us is the people who hated their situation they’d rather strike out on their own with no security bias creating individualism vs collectivism being formed by farming villages all tending to one large rice field in Asia. South rooted in honor given people had little access to justice in the rural south and needed to protect their land also never moved so would be there for generations. Created more of a need to defend what you have creating honor culture. Religions reflect and transmit values of culture whether monotheistic or polytheistic but this chapter is all about how we’re products of our environment. Warfare is constant throughout human history. Nearly universal in humanity 90-95% of tribal societies engage in warfare but some anthropologists argue this is cherry picking data. Current tribes have higher rates of violence than human populations in modern cities but this data is disputed by the people do believe humans are peaceful people. Arguments on both sides for everything. Hunter gatherers shared a lot and gossiped for social cohesion. Gossip is weapon of norm enforcement. There was fighting involved for them over women and good land. Sharing was important because not everyone would be successful every hunt. There were executions for norm violations. This guy seems to think hunter gatherers didn’t fight so something about scarce resources and agriculture sparked fighting genes in humans.

    - **Note:** Culture is a big transmitter of values and where we grow up has a big effect on us. Creates ingrained bias. Social proof/ signaling and gossip. History is so biased by the reader. There is no clear source of truth but people certainly fight over scarce resources. Must be close and in competition that is why conflict and similarity are tied
- Genes code for behaviors but can be triggered and turned on by environmental factors so you have a dynamic dance of genes. Genes can be triggered by environment and code for more than one protein. Transpositions events are random shuffling of dna taking a sequence from one area putting to somewhere else to see if it creates a more favorable environmental conditions and adjustments. This can be done during a drought to hopefully survive longer. Identical twin studies are valuable to show behavior is both genetic and environmental. Traits are heavily influenced by both nature and nurture and it’s very complex. Gene environment interaction. Genes only matter in environments. It’s a combo that activates genes. Genes are extremely context dependent and often combine to have one effect many genes control height yet genes are very important
- Our brain is still maturing and adolescence and intelligence is more efficient brain not a bigger one. We’re constantly learning and growing in this time which leads to a lot of revolutionaries being younger but also a lot of murderers because we’re still learning. Adolescence is about risk taking and novelty seeking. Risk is perceived as lower and crave new experiences. Adolescence are more malleable and prone to influence and peer pressure. This helps us have more empathy. Emotional and social intelligence predict success more than SAT scores. Kids can’t understand empathy they want to help but think what makes them happy makes everyone happy. Don’t ask what a gene does but what it does in an environment

    - **Note:** Adolescence is when the brain isn’t truly formed, and this leads to more risktaking and much more influenceable. Ask what a gene does in its environment. Benefit of adolescence is being ignorant of our ignorance
- Childhood adversity including abuse and poverty have major effects on how people live and develop in a negative way. Can increase depression risk because you have less mental bandwidth to deal with problems. Depression is a pathological sense of loss of control. Learned helplessness. Video games and more violent content as a kid leads them to be more violent. Bullying is bad most people grow out but it’s bad when people bully those weaker and get bullied by stronger people. Authoritative authoritarian and permissive then neglectful parenting. First is balancing and dynamic the next is extreme control the other one is extreme freedom no guidance. We also learn through play from our peers. The opposite of play isn’t work but depression. Play is vital to growth and learning for kids and peers. Culturally the lower class someone is the more the parent is authoritative groups kids together the more upper class the more parenting is focused on kids emotions over outcomes in the lower class. Instead of authoritative rules and growing up the ladder it’s do what makes you happy and fulfilling more than successful. Emotions vs outcomes.

    - **Note:** Childhood adversity, and depression compound. Depression is a pathological sense of loss of control. Learned helplessness. The cycle of bullying and feedback loops. Follow what gives you energy. Parenting techniques to allow for emotional support and better outcomes
- Decision making stages Lawrence kohlberg 1. pre conventional reasoning 1. Will I get punished if I do this 2. Will I get rewarded if I do this. Ego oriented response mainly only in kids. 2. Conventional reasoning what would other people do who will be deprived of I do what will others think of me if I do. What is the law is this illegal. This reasoning is relational in adolescents and adult. 3. Post conventional reasoning how did the cookie get there? Should I take it? What’s the deeper story here. Is my moral stance greater than some law that says I can’t do this. Inner rules show rules and law abiding aren’t always just willing to deal with consequences even death for sticking to your guns. This is also egoistic. Being good and law abiding are different. You need to live with yourself after the decision. This can be inspiring, but also insufferable behavior. Arguments against viewing the world, post conventionally, and valuing stage two and the importance of interpersonal relationships. Often it’s very tough to do the morally right thing unless it’s easy. Strong will power is more about distraction and reappraisal than stoicism. It’s hard to avoid something in front of you and easier to change your environment to make easier decision. In a study where animals were hit by their mother they didn’t shy away but held on harder. We hold on harder to negative influences and trauma than we should.

    - **Note:** Pre-conventional conventional and postconventional reasoning. Preconventional is very me centric what will happen to me if I do this conventional is taking into account society who will be helped or hurt when I do this and is this against the law and then postconventional is back into the ego instead of just having a more simplified version of the world, you see the world in a more complex way and that informs your decision, or maybe you are breaking law but that law is wrong and that’s a post conventional step. Basically thinking for yourself. Internal locus of control and designing your environment well.
- Neurons and knowledge doesn’t lie is having more neurons but stronger pathways between neurons. The neurons rely to non linear processes. You need to reach a threshold of glutamate to unlock learning. This is why it takes time to learn things and it can go in one ear and out the other learning requires reaching a critical threshold once this is done the material is incorporate in neurons and effectively this this the learning process. This is our information gets in the brain in the neurons, but then LTP help to become stored, long-term and remembered. This is how you remember facts not as much processes and then the info is passed when the information is destroyed and rebuilt. Stress blocks some of these hormones which impairs learning. Experience alters neurons to increase learning through more repetition that calcifies knowledge more. We have recently learned we can grow new neurons even in old age and we can do this through exercise enrichment learning among others and inhibited by various stressors. Adult neurogenesis is a new idea that was rejected by dogma for 50 years before it became accepted as real. We can grow the size of our brains. Our brains are always evolving and we can always keep learning positively or negatively. End dogma adult brains are set in stone.

    - **Note:** Knowledge is built through reinforced connections but is non linear. Hearing something requires hitting a critical threshold/ mass before crossing the chasm to knowledge. This is how we build pathways. Stress blocks these pathways which impairs learning. Our brains are always evolving and changing we can always learn. This requires repeated exposure and experience which creates this knowledge pathways through neuro science. Stay mentally flexible keep evolving and keep learning
- The right kind and level of stress that feel in sports is important for a few minutes but constant stress over daily life like a 30 year mortgage is destructive and unhelpful we didn’t evolve to deal with these long term existential stressss. We need a golden mean of stress but too much and constant is destructive. Stress causes our brain to learn fear easier but much harder to unlearn fear. Stress impairs inability to change our minds and switch direction. Stress puts us in a rut we can’t change our ways so life becomes automatic and habitual. Then we continue to do the same things expect a different outcome the front cortex needs to prompt you into change but under stress this is much harder. Stress also implores us to take more risk instead Of protecting losses we become risk seeking when we’re stressed. Hormones enhance preexisting tendencies if you take risks hormones like testosterone can make you more or less aggressive. Sustained stress impairs risk assessment. We compensate for stress by projecting it on others through violence sometimes to cope. Domestic violence goes up during recessions and when sports teams unexpectedly lose. Stress makes us selfish. Stress decreases empathy. Testasteronie doesn’t invent aggression it accentuates it during times of status threats especially. Hormones exaggerate tendencies that exist.

    - **Note:** Physical stress is important but psychological stress that remains constantly in our minds is very negative. Fear is hard to unlearn. Stress impairs our ability to grow and think we also take on more risk when were stressed and hormones get jacked up. We then project it onto other to cope decreasing empathy making us selfish. Stress just brings out these feelings. Stress brings out bad parts of us and must be balanced correctly. Decreases empathy
- There are cues like skin, color or music that stimulate a perception of someone similar to the priming of saying ocean before asking for a cleaning product or someone would say tide. These relationships aren’t fully true but the stereotypes we learn create our perceptions of reality and send it right to the amigo before we can have the chance of understanding and processing the event. We have an immediate response so when someone reaches in their pocket, we can think oh they’re gonna pull out a gun. Bypass logic gut reaction also linked to behaviorism which is bs. The stimuli can also be physical. Think a smile just making someone happier. Physical stimuli can create outside perceptions. Words can also stimulate behavior or opinions through priming. Framing the situation has a big effect on perception. People evacuate male hurricanes more and leads to a lower death rate even though names are picked arbitrarily because there’s a perception of authority with male names. Subtle unconscious cues. Social and physical environment shape our behavior. People are more likely to liter in areas that look worse ie broken window theory of crime. We understand and perceive emotions more through the eyes than anywhere else and psychopaths look less that the eyes than normal people. Culture shapes behavior. Cues shape our brain response right before we make a decision creating unconscious biases we don’t recognize.
- Dopamine reward pathway scales rewards relative to other rewards so if we pull over and get a reason, do we go up then we put the same lever and get two raisins dopamine goes up 2x vs 1 raisin but after we get 2 for awhile are dopamine levels to the same as the 1x original and then if we were to get one raisin after getting 2 our dopamine would drop. Hedonic treadmill. Systems respond to relative not absolute if we get one extra reward or 10 extra reward we feel the same dopamine when that goes to four or 40. We code for discrepancy in expectation if we get something bigger or sooner, our dopamine levels change more. This happens positively and negatively. We scale dopamine to the world as it adjust us. Unnaturally strong, stimuli of dopamine, like fake sugar create unnaturally, high dopamine and push the Overton window on happiness much higher than we’re evolutionarily built for and so the common pleasures of life like a sunset don’t release as much dopamine. Hyper engineering the world leads to raising the bar constantly humans don’t crave less as they get more but crave the same relative to the past which leads to a higher gain for the same level of increase. 10K for someone who has 10 K is the same as 1 million to someone who has 1 million. Scale with life. Life is relative not absolute. Dopamine is more about the anticipation than the reward, but if we don’t get the reward, it’s a disaster. This also leads to environmental context dependent stimuli. Often the signal can become the reward where if you go to a place to feel happy and smoke weed just going to that place without even doing that can make you happier. Signal becomes reward. When we have intermittent reinforcement, it creates more dopamine that we press and 100% reward create dopamine when pulling when the road only comes out 50% of the time. Uncertainty drives dopamine. Dopamine peaks with anticipating dopamine and near misses 50-50 chances leads to more dopamine released than 75% or 25% the near miss makes it more dopamine. Dopamine helps find the work to the outcome. It helps enhance the pursuit of reward so we love the process. Dopamine fuels delayed gratification helps us code for reward magnitude delay and reward likelihood keep us stimulated and pushing forward when we’re motivated to do long range tasks. Dopamine helps temporal discounting how we delay gratification hours months years or lifetime to look good in a bathing suit next summer instead of eating now or dying on the field of battle to make it to an after life no species can really do this but us.

    - **Note:** Dopamine pathway and the hedonic treadmill. Dopamine scales but then it levels so we need higher highs to become the same level of happiness and it is hard to reach those constantly. We are always chasing. Relative vs absolute changes. Life is relative live absolute. Dopamine is about anticipation we get happier from making the bet than the outcome of the bet. The signal becomes the reward. Dopamine helps delay gratification. The near misses drive dopamine more than the sure thing that doesn't go our way. Interesting feedback loops and dopamine fueling delayed graduation. Scale and life
- Prefrontal cortex does the harder thing when it’s the right thing to do like looking for traffic before you jaywalk or looking for the light on top of a yellow car when hailing a cab. This mediates executive action considering info choosing bits of info to focus on then making a decision. Self control is finite resource pfc is the most vulnerable to overload from too much cognitive load. This is worked when learning but becomes easy once we learn something then it becomes innate like learning to pee requires a ton of attention but very little now. Social complexity expands the pfc and allows us to do the hard thing like not farting in public or restraining hitting on someone requires a lot of the pfc. this is how we control our inhibition. There are different areas of the brain that control thinking and decision making so we can know the right thing to do but when it comes time to do it our brain can make a separate decision overridden by emotions vmplc and dmplc battle for emotion and cognition and when the emotion part is damaged we struggle to internalize things and can’t learn make decisions vs when we lose logic we become illogical. Emotion is vital to non emotional judgement. The point of cbt is reprising past thought patterns and switching their meaning. Transcending the old thought to create a new positive though this belief is as the core of therapy. Therapy is replacing not forgetting thought and having agency to do that. We do the hard thing that isn’t always easy through dopamine
- Layers of the brain one is the most ancient level that does automates activity if your body is cold the body works harder to warm up. Layer 2 directs layer one through emotions we feel bad so we tell layer 1 to send signal to stress eat. Layer 3 neocortex this is we control feelings send them to layer 2 then layer 1. These are not purely hierarchical and can have complex interactions. Automaticity emotion and cognition the 3 layers. Autonomic nervous system mid brain and brain stem that communicate between body and involuntary aspects like heating and cooling. Like a reptile telling them to raise or lower body temperature without thought. Autonomic has sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system the first controls fear and fight and flight the other works on regulation of calm vegetative states like digestion. If you’re being chased don’t worry about digestion. Ramp up vs calm down. Cortex is area of cognition and logic but the limbic system talks with the cortex. The cortex is how layer 2 talks to layer 3. Amigdala is where aggression fear and anxiety originate. The default state is to trust amygdala teaches us vigilance and distrust. It teaches us to learn fears like Pavlovian conditioning of fear but we cannot forget fear we must follow the same pathways to conquer our fears. Amygdala is about the uncertainty and yern for potential pleasure anxiety and fear in pursuit of pleasure. Unpredictable pain is what activates the amygdala.

    - **Note:** 3 layers of the brain level 1 is the deepest most animalistic and innate. Level 2 is emotional regulator of emotions and level 3 is the highest cognitive ability that directs through. These are a dynamic dance where things arent just sent down levels but also back up levels too. Some things like calming the body happen automatically then there is thoughtful purposeful action
- We should be students of problems not fields and think complexly and cross disciplinary about the world because disciplines are arbitrary boundaries and the complex world transcends these so to understand and exist in the world we must constantly transcend these boundaries
