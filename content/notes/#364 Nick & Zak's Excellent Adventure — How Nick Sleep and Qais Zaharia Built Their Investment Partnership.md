- Embrace Uniqueness for Quality Investment
  Summary:
  A successful investor thrives by embracing individuality and viewing the world through a unique lens.
  Early experiences in various fields fostered comfort in being different, allowing for a distinct perspective on investing. The inspiration drawn from 'Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance' emphasizes a commitment to quality in every action, turning mundane tasks into meaningful endeavors.
  This dedication to quality not only brings satisfaction but also shapes investment strategies, as evidenced by the creation of the Nomad Investment Partnership, where high standards guide decisions.

  Speaker 1
  He had worked in a department store, at an IT firm, and had been a sponsored windsurfer. Still, he had stumbled into a field that perfectly suited his idiosyncratic mind. Like all of the best investors, Sleep views the world from an unusual angle. Sleep commented on this saying all the way back in high school, he says, I got comfortable with being different from everyone else early on. I was happy being outside the group. When sleep was about 20, he read the book Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, an Inquiry into Values. It was a strange but brilliant meditation on what it means to lead a life dedicated to quality. The book exalts people who care so intensely about the quality of their actions and decisions, that even the most mundane work becomes a spiritual exercise. For the author, motorcycle maintenance provides an ideal metaphor for how to live and work in a transcendent way. The real cycle you're working on is a cycle called yourself. The book's approach to life resonated deeply with sleep and shaped the type of investor he would become. This is how Nick Sleep described the book's enduring impact on him. You really want to do everything with quality as that is where the satisfaction and peace is. But what does this mean when it comes to investing? In 2001, Sleep and his friend, Kai's Zach Zakaria created a fund called the Nomad Investment Partnership ([Time 0:03:46](https://share.snipd.com/snip/423bf738-e705-4410-b40c-022fbab0161e))
    - **Note:** Do everything with quality because that is where transcendence satisfaction and peace lies. They 10xed their fund in 14 years they had 70% of the fund in one company. Independent thinking very concentrated. They delayed gratification. Zak grew up rich in Iraq has to flee with the revolutiona goes to England where his dad loses all his money betting with leverage on things he doesn’t understand after a lifetime of being successful in businesses he did. Then he goes to work in Hong Kong in finance and realizes his boss is crooked. He got investigated and zak got laid off he was desperate for a job the only one he could get was as a sell side analyst. He hated it so much but opportunity is a strange beast it often comes after a loss. Despite working for 4 years at a place he hates it’s where he meets his partner setting up for all his future sucesss. Nick is working at marathon which was a very non consensus place. Zak was working during the Asian crisis and nick and his boss would be the people he would sell the stocks he couldn’t sell to anyone that were trading .3x of replacement cost. They made 500mm and hired Zak over given they had the same mindset. This is when nick and Zak started to get into Berkshire and firm their partnership and philosophy
- Mastering Focus: Ignore to Succeed
  Summary:
  The path to success in investing and entrepreneurship hinges on mastering focus and intentionally ignoring distractions.
  Emphasizing the necessity of quality over quantity, individuals must concentrate on their craft with a long-term perspective. The concept of shelf life filters the information they engage with, allowing them to disregard transient data and popular noise that often leads to poor decision-making.
  Instead of constantly reacting to fleeting market conditions, successful investors work backward from their long-term goals, employing 'destination analysis' to determine actionable steps that align with their vision.
  The rejection of ephemeral information fosters a practice of intentional disconnection, allowing space for deep research and thoughtful insights.
  This rigorous focus results in superior outcomes, as seen in the philosophy of questioning everything and maintaining high standards—qualities reinforced by influences like Zen principles. The importance of surrounding oneself with the right people cannot be understated; the practice of saying no to unsuitable partners reflects a commitment to authenticity and control over one's journey. Ultimately, success derives from a deliberate choice to ignore the superficial in favor of substantial, quality-driven efforts that align with one's core values and long-term aspirations.

  Turns out I wind up learning from the very best. I don't need anything else besides that. And so when you have somebody like Nick that was fundamentally changed by this book that says, hey, dedicate your life to the quality, the quality of your craft. And then he goes to Omaha and he listens to the philosophy and the perspective of Buffett. And he realizes, oh, this is the Buffett in my business. Buffett is the embodiment of quality. So in 2001, Nick's bosses give him the green light to start Nomad Investment Partnership. And then he asked Zach to join him as a co-manager of the fund. And then go back to what Nick said about, hey I was real comfortable, I liked being an outsider from a very young age. And so he says, it was obvious that we were always going to do something a little bit odd. From the start, they regarded Nomad as an act of rebellion. And then this part just sings to my soul, because they decide to concentrate on what to ignore. This section is called, never mind the bollocks. I need to translate that to American for you. Never mind the bullshit is the way I would put it. And so they start out with a very simple ambition. Their target is a tenfold increase in nomads net asset value. And this is the part which I absolutely love. There's a great line, great maxim from the history of entrepreneurship that comes up over the organ. This is genius has the fewest moving parts. I think about that often as a reminder of myself to keep things simple. So what did they do? They have a one line description of actually what they want to do, they want to 10x their assets. And to do so, they work backwards from figuring out what to ignore. So Nick is going to quote the philosopher William James about their thinking. It's gonna sound a lot like Buffett and Munger too. Nick cites a line from the philosopher William James, the art of being wise is the art of knowing what to overlook. We just got rid of all the things we didn't like. They disregarded, this is one of my favorite parts. This is why I say that this part sinks to my soul. They disregarded all ephemeral information. Ephemeral information distracts investors or entrepreneurs or really anybody from what matters. Nick notes that information like food has a sell by date. Some information is especially perishable while some information has a long shelf life. This concept of shelf life became a valuable filter. And they're talking about the trap that most investors, and I would say now most people, everybody's stuck in the never ending now, as my friend David calls it. But specifically Nick and Zach are calling out what other, most other investors do they pay attention to fleeting news coverage and the daily soap opera That's what they call it. Nick dismissively refers to these people as junkies who crave information? Which will be worthless in 12 weeks as he sees it this short-term crowd responds constantly to fake stimuli? And this is what he says about this. You need to be wired not to believe the bullshit, to not be listening. We became very happy not hearing it. Nick and Zach told stockbrokers that it was pointless calling them with sales pitches since they relied on their own research to reach independent conclusions. My favorite story of this and an inspiration for me, I just finished reading for the second time another biography on Sam Walton This is episode 354. Yeah, the book is called Sam Walton the inside story of America's richest man It was actually published before Sam wrote his own autobiography and there's a line in this that I love where It says that on that day The market dropped and knocked a billion dollars off the value of Sam Walton's stock holdings in Walmart. When reporters asked his reaction to the disaster on Wall Street, he hadn't heard about it. I absolutely love that. When I went to dinner at Charlie Monger's house, I asked him because I was obsessed with Costco and Jim Sinegal. One of my favorite forwards of any book I've ever read is the fact that Jim Sinegal wrote the forward for Soul Prices, his hero and mentor's biography. And I knew Charlie knew Jim, and I was dying to find a book or some way to do an episode on Jim Sinegal. And I was like, why isn't there information? Like why is he so low key? And Charlie, in his wisdom, summarized it perfectly. He's like, that's because he was busy working. And so this idea of just, I have to go back to this, because this is, I spend my time in a very similar way, because I'd never called it a femoral ephemeral information like they did but I Think that's a great line they disregard all ephemeral information if you look at how I spend my time in the Mornings I read books usually old books about entrepreneurs in the afternoons. I reread highlights from these old books about entrepreneurs and Then I talked to founders and other smart people. I spend time with my family I take care of my health. And that's it. Nick and Zach call this practice a practice of intentional disconnection. This is the important part. Because they knew they discovered that if they do deep research and find great businesses at fair prices, and they keep them for a long period of time, they don't have to do anything else. And so let's go to this description of this practice of intentional disconnection. They wanted to think in peace, undisturbed by popular obsession. This requires uncommon conviction to disregard what most of your peers consider significant. So how do they spend their time? We just read annual reports until we're blue in the face and visited every company we possibly could until we were sick of it. When they analyzed companies and interviewed CEOs, Nick and Zach probed for insights with a long shelf life. Let's go back to that idea. This concept of shelf life became a valuable filter. They sought to answer such questions and here's some questions they would ask. Number one, what is the intended destination for this business in 10 or 20 years? Number two, what must management be doing today to raise the probability of arriving at that destination? Number three, and what could prevent this company from reaching such a favorable destination? They referred to this way of thinking as destination analysis. Nick and Zach focused instead on the inputs required for a business to fulfill its potential. It's actually works for people too. It's worth noting that destination analysis is an equally handy tool in other areas of life. So for example, if your goal is to be healthy, you analyze the actions that you need to take now, which will increase the odds of reaching that destination. Or if you want to be remembered lovingly by friends and families, what are they at? What are the actions you have to take now to make sure that hap...

    - **Note:** They want to create a fund that 10xs asset value and so they focus on what to ignore and that is all the low signal high noise information. Wants to commit his life to quality and start an investment fund based on quality. Intentional disconnection. They looked only for the highest signal stuff and did destination analysis which looked at where the world was going. What is the destination what must management do to get there what are the roadblocks that are preventing that. They were perennial outsiders dedicated to quality. Made investment not amount the money the goal. Keep the main thing the main thing. Had a no assholes rule life is too short. Live an authentic life. Be in the drivers seat of your life.
- Seek Quality, Embrace Longevity
  Summary:
  Investing in undervalued stocks can lead to significant short-term gains, but misjudging a company's potential can result in missed opportunities for even greater returns.
  The experience with Stagecoach highlights the importance of identifying strong, well-managed companies and holding them for the long term. Successful management is crucial, and by trusting capable leaders to make business decisions, investors can enhance their investment strategy.
  This realization emphasizes a shift from chasing quick profits to investing in fundamentally sound companies with growth potential.

  Speaker 1
  So in 2002, they find this business that they're going to invest in called Stagecoach. The stock had crashed from $2.84 down to 14 cents. But Nick and Zach figured that it was easily worth 60 cents. So Stagecoach is going through a turnaround led by the founder. So the founder was a former bus conductor. I got to see if this guy has a biography. Sounds fascinating. He's a former bus conductor who'd run the firm so well in the past that he become one of Britain's richest people. He comes out of retirement to try to fix this bus operation, this United Kingdom bus operation, and his strategy worked. Now here's the problem. Nick and Zach buy at $0.14. They cash out when the stock rebounds to $0.90, and they're like, wow, we got a 6x return. But stagecoach winds up being a way better business than they realized. And the stock shoots up to almost four bucks. And Nick says that this made him and Zach feel like horses asses. And so their realization is, hey, we need to forget this cigar butt business, we need to find wonderful businesses and hold those businesses for the long term. And the way they describe this is very fascinating. And so Nick says, if you're thinking rationally and thinking about the long term, you can subcontract the capital allocation decisions to them, meaning these one of these people, These phenomenal managers, ([Time 0:26:20](https://share.snipd.com/snip/eded7042-ff67-4014-879a-ad7606aa474d))
    - **Note:** Think long term and rationally not cigar butts but quality businesses. They found their favorite business model was scale economies shared. They saw coscos low margins as an asset not a liability because it created a moat long term. String long term flywheel. They grew by giving back created long term customer loyalty. They don’t want to be trading all the time they want to be thinking reading and talking all the time. Scale economies shared was their earned secret. Find an earned secret and exploit it. Great businesses share success they saw this with Costco but also Walmart and dell. Characteristic of a great founder they improve customer experience always keep costs low thibk long term very iconoclastic don’t go with the heard. They know they uncovered a deep truth and just built the fund doing that. That was their entire business. This is how they saw Amazon and they invested 70% of their business in it. Things are built slow then fast. Nomad lost 45% of its value in 2008 they didn’t panic instead doubled down on Amazon Costco and went on a run up 400% in 4 years before closing the partnership. Many people left at this time but these are the points when conviction matters most you must keep the faith this is when you’re defined by the hard times. When everyone else panicked they doubled down. Find companies that care about the important things and do the right thing long term.
- Master Knowledge to Accelerate Success
  Summary:
  Building an encyclopedic base of knowledge allows individuals to transition from slow, methodical learning to rapid execution.
  Foundational figures like Sam Walton and Warren Buffett exemplify this principle through their initial slow approach to mastering their fields, enabling them to seize larger opportunities later in their careers. This depth of knowledge acts as a filter, allowing experienced professionals to quickly discern what is significant and relevant.
  By investing time in extensive reading and comprehension, one prepares for future opportunities that may not be immediately obvious, thereby leveraging years of accumulated insight to accelerate decision-making and action in a fast-paced environment.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  There's this idea of slow then fast. And it has to do with the importance of building this like encyclopedic base of knowledge. Let me give you a story from a founder first. And I think Warren Buffet's an example of this and Lee Liu is as well. This is why it's top of mind, given what I've been reading the past few weeks. But Sam Walton, the most remarkable thing is, he's the greatest retailer to ever live. He had one store for the first five years of his career. He focused on one store. And so over the decades, he winds up building up this encyclopedic base of knowledge of retailing. And so when he sees another opportunity, in a sense, when he sees the Costco opportunity, the Sam's Club opportunity, it's an opportunity he's been preparing his whole life for. And because he has this encyclopedic-based knowledge that has compounded over the years, he goes from moving very slow to very fast. One store in five years is very slow. Decades into his career, he opens up—I can't remember the number. I think it goes from zero Sam's Club, so let's say 100 Sam's Clubs, zero revenue to like five billion a year. I think in five to seven years. Lee Liu talked about this when he was chastising the Columbia MBA students because he's like, listen, when I was your age, when I was in this class, I got this giant book, this value line Book, you know, that you can see in the video looks like you could work out with it. It's right, you know, I don't know, 800 pages, something like that. And he goes, I read it cover to cover multiple times. And that's the way to do it, because you build this encyclopedic base of knowledge. And then after you do that, he says you can look at a page and value line. And in seconds, you can see if there's something more you need to look into. That is example going slow. So you can go faster later on, there is this AMA, this Ask Me Anything, that Alice Schroeder did on Reddit. Alice Schroeder is the woman that wrote, the author that wrote The Snowball, like 20 something years ago. And she talks about observing Warren Buffett's reading process now, you know, at that point he was what? Let's call it 40 years into his career, 50 years, something like that. And so because he's been reading annual reports for 50 years or longer, and that knowledge is compounded, he can actually read an annual report faster. That compounding base of knowledge acts like a filter to separate the important from the unimportant. And so think about how this relates to what Nick and Zach are experiencing. They're four years into their fund, but they're, you know, 15 years into their career, they know what they like, what they don't like. They've done intense amounts of reading, studying, talking to each other about what they learned, identifying the earned secret. All that years and years of work now allows them to go fast where they're like, wait a minute. This is exactly what Lee Liu said. Because he was like, he talks about some things you're not going to learn in your career. You're going to learn today that you won't use for 15 years. He's like, I was studying an American company 15 years ago. It took me 15 years to find its Asian counterpart. But then as soon as I saw it, I knew it. It's exactly what's taking place. They did all this work to get this earned secret to understand the importance and the power of this business model of the businesses that use the business model of scale economy shared That when they see what Bezos is doing Amazon Prime, like, oh my god, this is Costco. But on the internet, the encyclopedic base of knowledge you cannot shortcut because the encyclopedic base of knowledge is what helps you move quicker in the future. Slow and then fast. ([Time 0:37:47](https://share.snipd.com/snip/942ce391-a920-4278-96ca-11e6819e4ae9))
    - **Note:** Build an encyclopedic base of knowledge that forces you to go slow but allows you to go fast later in life because everything becomes obvious with your hindsight.
