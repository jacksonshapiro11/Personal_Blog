- Leadership in Universities: From Fear to Intimidation
  Summary:
  The shift towards students demanding protection from speech started around 2013-2014 when students began wanting safeguards from words, books, and speakers.
  This led to a cultural revolution in universities akin to the Chinese Cultural Revolution, where leaders failed to act and allowed intimidation to prevail over persuasion. The lack of punishment for disruptive actions in the name of social justice set a damaging precedent for universities, leading to a decline in their reputation.
  This failure in leadership continued, allowing for disruption and intimidation tactics during protests, especially in the context of debates like the pro-Palestine movement, where the tolerance for intimidation has led to a struggle for university leaders to address issues like anti-Semitism effectively.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Yeah. So began when Greg Lukianov, who is the president of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Education, noticed that all of a sudden around 2013 -2014, it was actually the students Who were demanding protections from speech, from books, from speakers, shut this down, ban this, stop this person from speaking. And he came to me and said something's wrong, something's really different about students today. It wasn't like this in 2012. Something's changed and they are more fragile, they want more protection from words, books, speakers, they think speeches, violence. And at the time we thought that these were millennials because that was the name for the young generation, millennials. And so we wrote an article on this in Atlantic like laying out what we think is happening, something is teaching these students to think in these distorted ways that are like cognitive Distortions. And then in 2015, so the article comes out August 2015, in October 2015, or November 2015, everything blows up beginning at Yale, the Halloween costume protests, all sorts of things. Universities undergo a kind of a cultural revolution, really some very similar, a lot of similarities to the Chinese cultural revolution, of pulling down everything high, pulling Down everything old, a kind of a revolutionary young people's movement, shaming professors, spitting on professors, all that sort of stuff. Now, so what's the continuity today? One of the worst things that the leaders did back then, the university presidents, they did nothing. Students would shout down speakers. No one was ever, ever punished for shouting down speakers, even when they used intimidation. Claremont McKenna did punish some students in 2018, but hundreds and hundreds of shout downs, no one ever punished. The message was, oh, as long as you're protesting social justice, you know, you can break the rules. You can use intimidation. You can shout people down. You can bang on glass and make people afraid for their lives. You can do those things because it's for a good cause and besides we're actually kind of afraid of you too. So that was the precedent that was set and that I believe was the beginning of one of the greatest brand destructions in American history. Higher ed used to have one of the greatest brands in the world. Elite higher ed was the envy of the world. Now it's a laughing stock. It's a, you know, Harvard is a punchline and jokes around the world, certainly in America. And so it's because there was fear, there was lack of leadership, and we permitted intimidation rather than persuasion. Universities must be about persuasion. You can never win an argument by saying, if you don't agree with me, I'm going to hurt you, I'm'm gonna destroy you socially. You can't allow that, but we did. And so now along come the protests. So of course the October 7th, the massacre was horrific. The Israeli response has produced horrific suffering and death. Yes, it's normal and expectable that there would be debates on a college campus. And nobody that I know of is saying people be protesting in favor of the Palestinians. But the question is really about the encampments and other efforts to disrupt the functioning of the university, to pressure the university, to make a statement pro -Palestine or Anti -Israel, or to divest from Israel. So this is the use of intimidation and disruption which They allowed for nine years before they said since 2015 as long as you're protesting for social justice You can do whatever the Hell you want. We're not going to punish you up for anything So now this sort of the intersectional social justice protests that are pro -palestine and often anti -Israel and often shading into anti -Semitism, the presidents don't know what to say. And that was the spectacle we observed on December 5th in that House hearing room of the three presidents who could not explain why it was against their policies for people to call for Death to the Jews. Like they couldn't, they had been so tied in and not with their hypocrisy, they couldn't even explain it. So yeah, there's a very direct continuity.

- Recognizing Harmful Untruths and Dualistic Thinking
  Summary:
  The central harmful untruths mentioned are: 'What doesn't kill you makes you weaker', 'Always trust your feelings and avoid exposure to things that offend you', and 'Life is a battle between good and evil people'.
  The speaker points out the dualistic thinking that causes human misery by oversimplifying complex societal issues, such as viewing everything as a power struggle. The shift in leftist ideology from focusing on economic inequality to power dynamics and oppression is criticized for creating a binary oppressor-victim mindset, pressuring individuals to identify either as oppressors or victims.
  This thinking is deemed disempowering and detrimental, especially for white individuals pressured to adopt victim identities.
  The oversimplification of complex issues like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through a narrow power lens is highlighted as limiting and offensive.
  The speaker criticizes the left for losing support from various minority groups due to their policies influenced by an oppressor-victim mindset, causing backlash even among non-white demographics, ultimately leading to electoral losses.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  No, good. No, that's right. And that's another point of continuity from the coddling. So the the central idea of the coddling was that there are three great untruths ideas that are so bad, that if any young person believes all three, they're almost certain to be depressed, Anxious, not amount too much in life. And those three are what doesn't kill you makes you weaker. So avoid stressful experiences, avoid speakers who are going to say things that you hate, don't expose yourself. Always trust your feelings, your feelings are right if you feel offended by something someone has offended you. And someone has to do something about this, someone has to punish that person. And the third, to your point about duality, is life is a battle between good people and evil people. And this is the distortion that's caused the most human misery. I mean, this is a normal thing people do. This is part of being a tribal species. We're very, very good at coming together to say our side has been hurt or cheated or defiled by their side. They're the evil ones. They're perfectly bad. We're perfectly good. So it's that third distortion is really the most pernicious from a societal level. Now, what you just said before about the haves and the have -nots, that's what the left used to be about from the time of Marx or the French Revolution even until the 1950s or 60s. It was about the haves versus the have -nots. And the left was the one that stood up for the have -nots and the left stood up for the poor and the people. But we go through a period, the sixties and seventies of the conversion away from a sort of a Marxist idea based on economics to something, is it a little bit Marx? Is it Michel Foucault? There's different intellectual heritages here where now it's all about power. It's not haves or have -nots. It's power. And power is such that, whatever you look at in society, you will see that some people have power and privilege and they use that to oppress the opposite. And this is what intersectionality is about. It starts with a perfectly legitimate point that there are multiple dimensions of identity and to be a black woman is not just the sum of being black or being woman, there are unique indignities That hit black women that you don't notice unless you are tuned into this. So intersectionality begins, Kimberly Crenshaw, with a very good insight, which I think was absolutely right. But the way it plays out on campus, what Greg and I argued in our book, is 18 -year -olds coming onto campus, they're easily lured into this incredibly simplistic and exciting way of looking At the world, which is, I don't have to know anything about you. I can just look at you and I can say, oh, you're a man. Oh, you're a white man. Oh, that means that you're an oppressor. And I can feel virtuous to the extent that I am not that. And this puts a lot of pressure, especially on white kids, to try to develop some identity as a victim, which is incredibly disempowering and just not good for the development. And what we end up with a movement that thinks in these binary terms. And this is what brings us to today is, of course, you know, Jews, I'm Jewish. We always thought that we were among history's victims. And certainly, you can't understand the creation of the state of Israel without understanding what happened in the Holocaust. But because of the way intersectionally played out, because whiteness is so quintessentially evil, like whiteness is the thing that's I, so everything that's not whiteness unites Together to fight whiteness. Now, most Jews, as I understand it, most Jews in Israel are actually Sephardic. They're not from Europe. But in America, Jews are coded white. And therefore, if there's a conflict between the Jews and the Palestinians, then obviously one is the one is the oppressor, one is the oppressed. Now, obviously, economically, Israel is wealthy, Israel is powerful. So it's not that there's no legitimacy to that view. Obviously, there's a huge power differential in Israel versus Gaza. But the mindset that says everything is about power is so narrow. And it's not that incorrect, boring, and offensive. I spent so many years trying to help the left using moral psychology so they would stop losing elections. And I finally decided they're beyond hope. The beyond hope too. But, you know, the left is losing Asians, it's losing black men, it's losing Hispanics. In the time of Donald Trump, why is this happening? A big piece of it seems to be this oppressor victim mindset pushes policies that are so offensive to most people of every race that they're like, I've had it with the left, don't like this. So sorry, that was a rant. That was more of a rant than an answer to your question, but I hope it was entertaining. ([Time 0:39:45](https://share.snipd.com/snip/94754684-fa7a-45a8-b8b5-46d189266e81))

- The Wisdom of Progressives and Conservatives in Balancing Change
  Summary:
  Our personality traits are partly heritable, predisposing us to the left or right.
  Progressives advocate for change, questioning existing institutions for better alternatives, while conservatives stress caution in altering structures without understanding them. A balance between left and right is crucial in a healthy democracy.
  When conservatives are absent, progressive revolutions often lead to chaos and cruelty, whereas a lack of progressives results in repression and limitations on rights.
  A functional society comprises reasonable left-leaning liberals and tradition-oriented conservatives.
  Extremist factions on both sides can resort to violence. The rise of social media has amplified extreme voices, silencing the moderate majority and polarizing society, a trend deemed detrimental to the nation.

  Speaker 3
  Because a lot of people our public audience a lot of people I talked to they're confused now about the terms because so much of traditional liberalism feels illiberal because of your Point about far left behavior traditional conservatism feels illiberal because of far right behavior what is the difference between the two and kind of help us bring balance to the Force.
  Speaker 1
  So I'll answer your question as a psychologist, which is one of the amazing discoveries in psychology since the 80s is that almost everything about our personality is partly heritable. And if you have an identical twin separated at birth, you never met. But if you're very much on the left, your twin probably is too. Something about our brains make us predisposed to the right or the left. And it goes back to openness to experience and conscientiousness of you personality traits. But basically, there's a there's a liberal or progressive sentiment that says it's captured by this Robert F. Kennedy quote, some men see things as they are and say why I dream things that never were, and say why not? So progressives historically are the people who look at existing institutions and say, you know, why don't we change this? Like why don't we have some other thing, which might be more just? So progressives are always pushing for progress, for change. But then the wisdom of the right is to say, you know what, we may not understand our institutions, but if we just go changing them willy -nilly, it's going to be a disaster because we don't Understand what we're doing. In fact, I opened our conversation with that. That's actually a conservative, but one thing I learned from reading the conservative intellectuals, going back to Edmund Burke, you can't just go messing with institutions and Expect it to work out well. So a good liberal democracy, one in which you have some people pushing for change, you've got other people saying slow down, like not so fast, like let's be careful about this. And that's William F. Buckley's famous quote about a national review is going to stand to thwart history yelling stop or at least slow down. So that's great. Like you have a car with a gas pedal and a brake, like you need that. And what happens when there are no conservatives? What happens when there's no one to say slow down? Progressive revolutions have an almost perfect record of disaster. I mean, it always descends into chaos and economic chaos and cruelty. And what happens when there are no progressives, when it's all conservative? You tend to get much more repressive, certainly LGBTQ rights. I mean, you get very predictable pathologies on either side. And part of my analysis, what I think has gone wrong in our country, what, you know, I'm very focused on what social media has done to society as well as to Gen Z is there always was a distribution Where most people on the left are reasonable left, they're progressives, I'm sorry, they're liberals. They believe in a John Stuart Mill vision of a society in which people are maximally free to construct lives that they want to live. That, I think, is the heart of the liberal vision, a liberal society. And on the right, you have conservatives who generally believe in tradition, family, group loyalty, religion, the things that bind us together and limit bad behavior. This is Thomas Sowell talking about the constrained vision of humanity. So that's all healthy. And then you always have some far left radicals who they become Maoist in one generation, they become Robespierre in another generation, they chop off heads, prone to violence on the Left you got a group prone to violence on the far right that are reactionary that are authoritarian and Let's say there was some distribution now then along comes Twitter along comes Facebook along comes social media. What happens? Mark Zuckerberg used to say how could it be wrong to give more people more voice? That sounds great But what if you're not giving the disempowered more voice? What if you're not giving everyone voice? What if you're bringing everyone into the Roman Colosseum and saying, okay, let's fight it out for the bit for the entertainment of the people in the stands. And the great majority of people don't want to fight with swords. They just go quiet. And some people pick up the swords like, yes, let's go. And so the far left becomes super empowered, the far right becomes super empowered, and the center left and the center right goes silent. And that's what I think is, you know, that's, I think, a real disaster for our country. ([Time 0:48:23](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5df0fdc1-e214-42ad-962f-734fe173f6c8))

- Understanding the Shifts between Liberalism and Conservatism
  Summary:
  The ideologies of liberalism and conservatism have not actually switched, but rather the left and right have changed.
  Conservatism typically reacts to the perceived excesses of the left in each era. The far left is focused on pulling down the top, rather than lifting up the bottom, which can be seen as an extreme form of egalitarianism.
  The Democratic Party consists of a center-left party with a progressive wing, while the Republican Party has shifted towards conservatism under Donald Trump, losing many moderates in the process.
  Overall, the Republican Party has veered significantly away from its traditional conservative values, resulting in decisions that may not align with the best interests of the country.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 3
  I think that was like such an excellent, like commentary for people to hear. I want to ask one on which is why has liberalism and conservatism in some aspects switched? So one of the things I think a lot of folks observe is that modern liberalism is a lot of redistribution, equality for the oppressed, bring everyone up to the same outcome, the same level On an outcome basis, which limits the freedom and flexibility of others. It limits free markets, for example. More taxes, more regulations is one way to characterize that, that conservatives will say. More taxes and more regulation is not John Stuart Mill. It's not more free market enablement. And then on the flip side, this idea of conservatives wanna have less government, less regulation, less taxes, which can drive more inequality of outcome, et cetera, can drive, in Fact, fundamentally, and I believe this very deeply, free markets drive progress, technological progress and social progress. And as a result, by technology out, the most disempowered benefit the most by new technology, they can progress more than the wealthy can progress. And so why has that flipped? Why is conservatism and liberalism in some aspects flipped? And when does that, what did that happen?
  Speaker 1
  Yeah. So don't think of it as though liberalism and conservatism have flipped. Think of it as though the left and the right have really changed. One thing I learned from studying conservatism from the intellectual historian Jerry Mueller is that conservatism in every era is a reaction to the excesses of the left. So if the left was the revolutionaries in the French Revolution, the right were monarchists. They wanted the restoration of the king. Right. If the left in America is about pulling down the founding fathers because they were slave owners, the right is going to be, no, we're gonna get extra patriotic. We're gonna wear funny hats, like the 18th century Americans. So you always have to understand the right as a reaction to what they perceive to be the excesses of the left. Now, a of what's happened is, as I said, the left is a political coalition that votes similarly in elections, same with the right. It's made of a mixture of different kinds of people. There's a wonderful study from Moore in Common that talked about the seven tribes of the seven groups of Americans. The progressive activists, which is the group on the furthest left, they were never liberal. In fact, they're really illiberal. They're not even about bringing up the bottom. They're much more focused on pulling down the top. That's the kind of, that's like the ugliest side of egalitarianism. So they're very focused on restraining rich people, pulling down privilege. They don't seem as concerned about bringing up poor people. So that's the far left, they're not liberal, but now, but for a while they were really dominant. Not in the democratic part, this is an important point. The democratic party has two wings. Which one usually wins? The liberal, the moderate wing, not the squad. So if you just look at the parties, the Democrats are a center -left party with a you know an outspoken progressive wing. That's great. That's viewpoint diversity. I love that The right is different if you just look at the party you used to have all kinds of true conservatives, you know George H .W. Bush through Mitt Romney. They were true conservatives, very decent men. They believed in decency, family, I mean, these, you know, they have a lot of respect for traditional conservatives. But now it's the party of Donald Trump. And the Republican party has gotten rid of nearly all its moderates. Now the Democrats pulled some dirty tricks that actually wiped out a few of those moderates, which I think they really have a lot to answer for. But my point is, if you just look at the parties, the Republican party has been gutted of its moderates. Now they do crazy insane things like, let's work really hard to solve the immigration problem. Oh, Donald Trump says, let's not do it. Okay, let's throw it out the window. I mean, insane stuff that is really hurting the country. So I just want to make it clear. I talk a lot about universities where the villain is the left. There really is no right to speak of on university campuses. But in Washington, I think the Republican party is the party that's really gone farther off the reservation or if you want to still say that today, whatever, you know, that's gone.
