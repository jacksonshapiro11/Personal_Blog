  This is a something normally i read a lot of old books for the podcast. This book just came out. I actually got the book on the day it came out. And joe passed way last year at 89 years old. So that's why they're speaking of him m and past tence.
  Speaker 1
  Here's another blur joe's amazing book on how he built traders. Joe's is a master class franch printeras i definly agree with that. And all interested an an all people interested successfully building a business. The story higlihts how a thoughtful disrupter uses insight, product knowledge and courage to rewrite the rules of a very large and established industry.
  Speaker 2
  And that's what makes why i wanted to read the book in general, that last sentence, where it says that he rewrote the rules of a very large and established industry. And i love this idea that, even thoughit's a very ancient industry, i mean, one of the oldest industries that ever existed in human civilization, he can rethink things that have existed For very long time. That was actually fasceting. I'll, i'll going to alot more detail about that.
  Speaker 1
  To day a joe built trader enovative management, creative marketing and keen story telling.
  Speaker 2
  This book is a wonderful account of how he did it, and of oncpenea spirit and action.
  Speaker 1
  Joe shows readers of all types how moving from an analytical approach to a more creative problem solving approach can drive innovation, how finding an fluent niche, these are the reason
  Speaker 2
  I'm reading thes to because i think what he the lessons he learned, applies to any domain, not justa selling food to people, selling groceris to people, how finding an fluent niche of
  Speaker 1
  Passionate customers can be a better strategy than competing on price and volume. ([Time 0:03:36](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c3022462-6055-4c4f-b031-308348c04b8a))
    - **Note:** Joe rethought an old industry. Found unique differentiation and questioned all aspect of existing industry. Because the milk business back in the day was so high margin it was rife with curroption bribery ect. Problems are opportunities in work clothes. Joe ran a C-store in the 7-11 model but when 7-11 came to town he knew he had to reinvent and this is when he discovered founded the idea for Trader Joe’s. Joe was a lefty and only wanted to hire lefties because they saw the world from a different angle. Joe had run convience stores for pronto markets but they were disbanding and joe had grown the compeny rapidly in his 8 years there so he took all his savings sold his house levered to the tits and bought pronto. He went all in. Shop your competition joe took a lot of lessons didn’t denigrate the past he took alot of his good ideas from sol price and Costco. If you adopt a reasonable strategy and stick with it it’s probably better than waiting for an optimal strategy. Tenacity is as important as brilliance. - guns of august.
- Non-Convex Problems in Business: Finding a Reasonable Solution
  Key takeaways:
  - Non-convex problems can have multiple good answers, but not necessarily an optimal one.
  - Finding an optimal solution in business is a waste of time due to constantly changing factors.
  - Paying employees well is a crucial business decision with high importance.
  - Paying higher wages can be seen as an asset rather than a liability.
  - Limiting turnover by paying employees more leads to better quality and overall success in business.
  - Ideas and strategies shared about running Trader Joe's were unique and interesting.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Go with a reasonable strategy that you won't quit instead of an optimal one, othat yu have to sit around and wait for.
  Speaker 1
  So he says, non convex problems are puzzles in which there may be several good, but not ideal answers, which classical search techniques may wrongly identify as the best one. And now he's going to give us an insight into his thinking at this time. I concluded that i didn't have to find an optimal solution to pronto's difficulty, s just a reasonable one. Trying to find an optimal solution in business is a waste of time. The factors in the equation are changing all the time. But you've got to have something to hang your hat on. The one corp value that i chose was our high compensation policies.
  Speaker 2
  And this what was referencing early er.
  Speaker 1
  He does not buary the lead, this is the most important, single business decision i have ever made, to pay people well.
  Speaker 2
  And so he's going to o in to more detail, and that later.
  Speaker 1
  A, what joe would tell us is like a bit the you're the wages that you pay.
  Speaker 2
  H paying the highest wages possible is an asset, not a liability. And i think a lot of business is to look at it, you know, as a cost a men. He'll go into more reason about why. Any talks about how expensive turnover is, and if you can limit that by paying people more, you get better qualities, just over and over again. A, it all ties together.
  Speaker 1
  So we'll get there, though. I'mhad myself.
  Speaker 2
  He's giving us some ideas, though, specific ideas, about how he ran trader joes, i thought thi idea was unique and interesting. ([Time 0:24:35](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2199abfc-0d84-4bb6-a51b-fc9d874c8e41))
    - **Note:** Non convex problems ie non linear problems have no answer but many paths and you can only optimize for a few vectors so you need to be careful of the trade offs you make. Paying people well was what joe chose and to him this was an asset not a liability. There is no optimal plan you need to keep adjusting Henry singleton idea of defined goal but undefined path steer the boat every day. Pay peanuts get monkeys he paid people really well because good people create value and the low turnover saves money in the end. He also listened to employees about issues so he knew problems so they didn’t unionize. He would have a superiors superior interview the people/ subordinates. He has the mental model of one vs 2 way doors and applied this to long term leases which he always ran himself. The more work he did in grocing the more he realized those in power were clueless the emperor had no clothes.

  Speaker 2
  He has funny names all of them, and we'll go through some of them and il explain why. But the last one's called mac the knife. And that is the trader jos as it is to day, where you have a small, intentionally small store, tentionally reduced to ours, selling largely all your own products.
  Speaker 1
  They ads that we began running for these extra large eggs revolutionized pronto markets, and they helpd to generate the profits that i needed to stay afloat. And they later and la to build the profits i needed to build trader joes. To this day, the promotion of extra large, double lay eggs is one of the foundations of trader joe's merchandising. Not just because of the programme per se, but because it set me to wondering whether there weren't other discontinuities out there in the supplies of merchandise. Eight years later, we built trader joes on the principle of discontinuity.
  Speaker 2
  So let's define, before i finish that paragraph, let's define discontinuity a sharp difference of characteristics between parts of something.
  Speaker 1
  The pronto market chain, at the time of seven eleven's arrival, had the highest sales per store of any convenient store chain in america by a factor of three.
  Speaker 2
  And this is what he says why. That was thanks to the high wage policy.
  Speaker 1
  Meaning he's got better people, better locations, a few liquor licenses, and the beginnings of differentiation through product knowledge, exemplified by the egg programme. Now, where were we going to go with it? We didn't know it yet, but we were well on the road to trader joes.
  Speaker 2
  And so now we see his mind set. This this inner monolog that's happening where hes ic well prontowere why he's gong a morf pronto into trader joe's.
  Speaker 1
  The basic problem is that convenient store retailing is a commodity business that is hard to differentiate.
  Speaker 2
  That is, that is the essence of trader joes. Reminds me of a quote from peter to in the book zero to one. You want to capture, you want to create and capture lasting value, don't build an undifferentiated commodity business. That's a quote from zero to one.
  Speaker 1
  We see joe is saying the same thing here. There'sthere's oing to be a ton of competitors that can come in.
  Speaker 2
  The more convenient stores that are built around me, the the less profit i'm going to build.
  Speaker 1
  Thereis no way for me to actually stand out. I've got to figure out a different concept. What i needed was a good, but small opportunity for my good, but small company. And that's another way to think of trader joes. He's not in to growth for growth's sake. Ah. He prefers small stores, small crews. Ah.
  Speaker 2
  He'll talke go into detail about studying the of the retail industry, an american realizing they're all going bankrupt because they can't stop building. ([Time 0:29:34](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b96457ab-7299-4b4c-ba33-3dbde63a8397))
    - **Note:** The built Trader Joe’s on discontinuity by asking the right question and constantly offering unique differentiation in products and experience. They sold extra large eggs which didn’t have a supply great enough to be sold nationwide so he cornered the market and sold many things you could only find in his store. He realized c-stores were very lowest common denominator compete on price and he wanted to create a differentiated business. He was well read and read scientific America where he saw the country was getting more educated and traveling more and there was a niche for more exotic foods and higher class experience. He wanted to start small then scale he would rather be successful than outgrow himself and collapse. He realized America was becoming a homogeneous culture with super markets selling the same cpg brands and competing on price like minute made orange juice or Folgers coffee. Joe realized the country was getting more educated and there was a group of people who needed something different from the herd. He spends years trying different concepts until he settles on small stores limited hours selling their own product like brooks brothers. Connect the dots looking back it took awhile to discover.

    - **Note:** Human life needs a concept of purpose he learned this from Caesar and Julio Ortega. Joe was very well educated. The state is a plan of action and a program of collaboration joevtook a cue from these people and understood he needed to sell everyone on his vision. Communication of the plan and galvinazation above all. Success in business rests on the minute reading of the industry rules. Kobe did this when he read the referees handbook. Kobe understood the rules and where the refs could and couldn’t see so he could get away with more. He gets into wine and decides to buy an old licsence instead to getting a new cheaper one because the grandfather values gave him much more flex which was key to his success. This wine selling is the first foray into the Trader Joe’s plan of selling to overeducated and underpaid people. He prefers small teams and stores not growth for the sense of growth. Joe took his ideas on advertising for the private Trader Joe’s magazine from Ogilvy. They talked about why they were differentiated what’s ordinary to you is extraordinary to others.
- Trader Joe’s deliberately tried to create and cultivate Trader Joe’s as a cult. Bewhere of violating the trusts of your true believers. Success is a road of mistakes well handled. Innovation is not a result of intellect but will. Business is creative problem solving
  He came up with the idea for retailing after the industry was deregulated by going back to the 1400s original definition of buying things whole and cutting them up this became this strategy. The idea of retailing was like cheese you buy a wheel and you sell the pieces. Economies of scale. Also he insourced only when all the other stores outsourced to cpg. They reduced skus hours and decisions which were tenants of retail but delivered great value so their customers loved them. He rejected all the rules of the game for unique differentiation. He rethought the industry bottoms up not take accepted wisdom. People will always love good value and quality. Creates word of mouth marketing Would rather not be competitive but invent his own game. Limit the amount of details and make it perfect not price at all costs. Never took discounts in foods and never made decisions by committee. He sold his life’s work and regretted it. He was not sad he could’ve sold for more but that he lost agency over his baby and that killed him. ([Time 0:49:39](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e823b402-3a6a-43a2-9e09-21f6b662d1c8))

    - **Note:** Joe wanted to create a cult of true believers with a high trust culture and deep commitment to the brand.
      He counter positioned against all retailers by getting back to first principles through deep historical knowledge he understood the game so well then he transcended its paradigms and rethought the industry bottoms up
      He sold and lost control it was his biggest regret he was high agency.
      He focused on things that didn’t change like delivering value.
