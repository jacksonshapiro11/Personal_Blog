  Speaker 1
  Once they've discovered an unknown artist and nurtured her into a valuable commodity, he can lure that artist away with promises of more money, more support, and a bigger platform. And so you might be able to guess the senses that comes next because in any industry, at any time, anytime somebody stacks these bunch of these unfair advantages on one on top of another, And then gets a bunch of size and then uses that size to their advantage, they're described the same way by people that that lack those resources and lack the ability to do so. So it says when contemporaries, meaning his competitors, describe him, they tend to summon carnivore analogies, a tiger, a shark, a snake, his own publicist once described him as A real killer. And so on the next page, I actually printed this out at 77 pages when you print it out, talks about the fact that there is part of his empire that is very confusing to a lot of his competitors. And the fact that he has to have a high level of overhead and he operates on a much grander scale than any other art dealer. And so he has these lavish estates all across the world. He hosts these really expensive parties, but they're not really parties. You can clearly see what he's doing. And we'll go into that the fact that they're essentially just their sales events, just disguised as a party. So I'm just going to read through this and we'll get to, I think, where these people are confused, but we've actually seen people use what other people think are liabilities as assets.

    - **Note:** He is not introspective at all he views this as a weakness he’s a shark. He doesn’t see himself as a galleriest like others but rather in mercantile exchange. He doesn’t spread his bets on smeller artists but rather bets big once and artist reaches a critical mass and escape velocity. He doesn’t try to do and consider many things at once but focuses and keeps the main thing the main thing. The value in lavish parties to win business. The yatch and high overhead helped Ludwig close deals. Here larry uses his big house parties to sell art. Everything is for sale in his homes even the furniture. Bernard arnaud says he likes his couch he offers to sell it to him. His lavish high overhead parties drive a ton of demand. He’s a shark and keeps the main thing the main thing making him easy to interface with. He understands the art market that is fragmented by making 100 cold calls a day. He meets all his customers demands like ordering off a menu and will often pay well above reasonable price for a piece. Larry reads about Joseph duvine who helped assemble the collections of the robber barons and he does this by owning his network and being the central node in it making himself more powerful than anyone else.

  Speaker 1
  The parties are marketing showcases in disguise. And so ever since I did that podcast on Bernard and all, it's episode 296 if I haven't listened to it. Yep. I've just been fascinated by trying to collect as many stories about him as possible. And there's actually, I mentioned this earlier, but he appears in this piece. And so he's at gozion's townhouse in Manhattan. And he says, are in all expressed enthusiasm for some art on display. And I told him everything here is for sale. You want to buy this chair? You can buy this chair. You want to buy the painting? Just ask it is all for sale. This is what I mean about gozion just makes it really easy to interface with him. He's a shark for sales, right? Gozion insisted to me that he does not sell art out of his house and then allowed that he actually... I love that. I don't do that. Oh, yeah, I actually do that. He's just hilarious. And he says, a true dealer knows that everything has a price. And the best way to raise the price of something is to say that you would never sell it. That is actually not a direct quote from gozion, but that does describe him. So let me say it again. A true dealer knows that everything has a price. And the best way to raise the price of something is to say that you would never sell it. And so the majority of this piece focuses on like Larry's business, how he built the business, what it looked like when he was in the early days, what it looks like now, there's not a lot Of family history, but it is fascinating. ([Time 0:19:01](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2ee951fa-4476-4eeb-8fb6-7a9017163dcb))
    - **Note:** A true dealer knows everything is for sale and saying it isn’t raises the prices. He is always working the lavish parties just serve his main goal of selling art. He took 6 years to graduate from college he’s working for Michael ovitz and hates working in the office but he’s a master salesperson. His dad was a drunk who died young. He had little ambition but eventually found it as he got older. He was working as a parking attendant and saw a guy selling cheap car posters and decided he could do that so he started adding cheap frames to make them more expensive then starts working with local craftsmen to sell their art. He’s just a master salesmen who stumbled into art but it could’ve been literally anything and then did it for 50 years to compound his advantage.

  - Gagosian's easy-to-understand approach and impatience with pretense endeared him to Leo Castelli.

  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  A cold call changes his life because Gibson at the time was represented by maybe the most legendary or one of the most legendary art dealers in New York at the time. It's guy named Leo Castelli, a description of Leo Castelli in those days in the art world. They called him the Pope, the Pope of art dealers. And then immediately, because Gagosian knows that building relationships run everything, you have to build relationships. He starts building a relationship with a much older art dealer. And Leo took a liking to him. And so Gagosian talks about like, what, well, why like Leo could, you know, build a relationship with any young art dealers? Like why is he doing that with you? And then this goes back to the main theme. Why, why, what got me interested in reading this profile to begin with genius is easy to understand. He makes himself unbelievably easy to interface with, just like Steve Jobs did. Steve Jobs did it in three words, insanely great products. You're interested in building insanely great products. Come work with me. If you're interested in buying insanely great products, buy my products. He's so easy to understand. And so Gagosian says that his impatience with the art world pretense may have endured him to Leo Castelli. I did not do a lot of blah, blah, blah. I think my bluntness appealed to him. So they start building a relationship. Gagosian got on the plane that is so important, get on the plane, gets to New York. It's not he's building this relationship. He's actually moves. He moves his entire operation to New York. ([Time 0:28:29](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e0ae6b86-1a81-45ff-9681-0ff63932b2f9))
    - **Note:** Cold call changes his life he wanted to sell an east coast artist on the west coast he’s constantly reading and learning and running a business where his employees run to the bank after getting paid or else the check would bounce. He met the largest art dealer in New York Leo Costelli and got on a plane to meet him. He took a liking to Larry as Larry was easy to interface with and took him under his wing. He walked by a premier collector who Leo said hi to in passing he asked who it was doubled back and got his number he has no filter or shame. Leo prided himself on finding new artists while Larry wanted to cultivate the secondary market which was looked at low status. Opportunity in plain sight that is a clear opportunity in an existing business that people shun and Larry had a natural skill of dealing with rich people. He becomes a master in a fragmented secondary market matching the people with rare pieces that want to sell with willing buyers working at a time of great wealth creation that created many new buyers. He loved the hunt and cosetlli could give him the map. He would show up to parties he was t invited to to snap pictures of the art in the wall and try to sell it default aggressive rejects convention
- How Gagosi Built His Financial Empire
  Key takeaways:
  - He made $2 million by making two phone calls

  - He is constantly working and not slowing down despite his wealth
  - He carefully observed people and identified high net worth individuals and potential art collectors
  - His aggressiveness and sharpness set him apart in the business world

  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So you could think about that. He just made $2 million by making two phone calls. And so if you grew up in a middle class family, your dad was a drunk and he was a gambler. You didn't have a lot of money. And now you can make, you know, $10 million a day. You would probably work 24 seven two. And so by the 90s, he's just making a ton of money. He's buying houses in Long Island. He's got a carriage house on the Upper East Side. He's driving a Ferrari. He's leasing in this giant new gallery space on Madison Avenue. And yet he's still not letting his foot off the gas. So they talk about he just built out this, this gallery on Madison Avenue. One of his friends is standing next to Gagosi and in the gallery looking out out at the street, watching all the people go by to his friend, maybe to you and I, those are people. That's not what they were to Gagosi. And they were prospects. Listen to this. So he says, all these people walking by, he was clocking which men of extreme high net worth and which existing or potential art collectors were passing by and saying, there goes so and So. He knew who everyone was. He saw them before they knew him, that kind of aggressiveness and that eagle sharpness for who mattered. There was no precedent in this business for that. That's the eye of an industrialist. That is someone who is seeking to build a massive financial empire. And so this is a little bit about how Gagosi manages his empire. ([Time 0:41:45](https://share.snipd.com/snip/80b44ab3-7e1a-4eed-a002-66f5a7c9a6bf))
    - **Note:** He moved incredibly fast he was at a Marc jacobs dinner party in Paris and 2 days later had offers for his artwork and after 3 days the money was in Marc bank account. He kept going looking out and seeing all his customers before they knew him. He moved fast default aggressive. He made 20% commissions. He has no plans to retire even at 78. He is very discrete and makes his money off of information asymmetry not introspective and thinks self reflection leads to losing your edge. Geniuses have the fewest moving parts and most focus. Bias for action over anything and move on from loses. Genius lies in ignoring the unimportant what’s important is to keep moving forward. Forget what doesn’t matter keep going forward. He understands business runs on money and he’s constantly trying to sell and poach clients. He gets into the primary market by calling artists 20+ times until they pick up he was a master salesmen knew the world ran on money.

  Speaker 1
  In 1980, when a Jasper Johns painting sold for a million dollars, the deal made headlines because it was the first known instance in which a work by a living artist had broken seven figures. Okay, so 1980 a painting by a living artist is sold for a million dollars 30 years later, 2010. Stephen Cohen purchased another painting by Jasper Johns for a hundred and ten million dollars. And so gozier makes the point that yeah, 1980 huge bull run, but it's not all up there. There's like ups and downs, right? Overall, the arching theme is obviously up until the right, but he does something smart. He goes to where his customers are. There were subsequent dips to be sure, but each peak has been higher than the other one that preceded it. In 2012, he opened a gallery on the grounds of some French airport. I'm not even going to try to pronounce. It's an airport for private jets outside of Paris, where his clients can buy art upon landing in their private jets. Everything this guy does, he just he just makes one smart move after another. It is very logical, very easy to understand. I'm going to call it simple and I don't mean it as a pejorative. He's there's a there's a genius in this guy's simplicity. He's just constantly looking for an advantage after advantage regardless of what's going on, even during downturns. So here's David Gefen's not done. He's still in the story. Okay. ([Time 0:53:28](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8216d191-f450-4e1b-b7b9-1600177c6248))
    - **Note:** Larry is operating in this 40 year art bull market and he helps not only his artists but his clients make money. He’s constantly buying and selling sometimes the same painting multiple times he built a gallery in a private jet hanger simple and easy to interface with. He cultivates exclusivity and tells people no who never hear that word. Understands and owns the market so people can only go through him. He is always collecting information and moving in silence. People will pay more just because he sells it he is a brand and endorsement. He always finds demand and pioneered the oligarchs buying. in one week he sold a painting twice for 7 and 10mm and made commissions on both Ronald Perlman refused to pay 8 Larry ends up selling it then Ronald is willing to pay 10 to get it. Human nature never changes. Larry is his entitle business
