- Summary: Americans have been spending less time socializing in person, leading to a rise in solitude, anxiety, and dissatisfaction. Statistics show that from 2003 to 2022, Americans, especially teenagers, have reduced their hours of face-to-face socializing significantly. The decline in socializing has been accompanied by an increase in screen time and a shift towards spending more time alone. This trend has had a particularly negative impact on teenagers, with rates of depression and hopelessness on the rise. The decline in socializing is attributed to factors such as increased screen time, busyness, and the erosion of America's social infrastructure.

### Highlights

- During my time picking through ATUS data, I was reminded of the Harvard Study of Adult Development, which is the oldest longitudinal study on happiness and well-being ever conducted. Last year, its directors [said](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/harvard-happiness-study-relationships/672753/) that the “simple and profound conclusion” of their work was that good relationships are the key to happiness. Just as many people are familiar with the concept of physical fitness, they said, we should be equally open to the concept of *social fitness*. We should care for our relationships as we’d care for our body. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqhgre6sp298qf7r2fzwkgww))
