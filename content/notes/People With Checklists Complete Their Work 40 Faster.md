- Summary: People who use checklists can complete their work 40% faster, but most people make their checklists wrong. To use checklists effectively, it is recommended to do a brain dump of all tasks in your head, separate tasks by importance, create a morning routine list, time block, connect tasks to goals, stop overloading the list, and review it at the end of the day. These tips can help increase productivity and focus.

### Highlights

- 1. Do a brain dump.
  Write down all tasks in your head.
  All projects, goals, and to-dos.
  This releases cognitive load.

  2. Separate tasks.
  Distill it down to 3-5 big tasks for the day.
  Use the Eisenhower Matrix to separate tasks by importance.
  → Urgent and Important 
  → Not Urgent, but Important 
  → Urgent, but Not Important 
  → Not Urgent and Not Important
  * * *
  3. Create a Morning Routine list.
  Every day, start with a simple 5-15 minute routine.
  Example: 
  → Water 
  → Breakfast 
  → Stretching 
  → Plank 
  → Meditation
  This helps your brain switch into a productive state.

  4. Time Block.
  Schedule time for each task.
  Work for 90 minutes and then take a break.
  Use the Pomodoro Technique.
  25 minute work sprints with 5 minute breaks.
  * * *
  5. Connect tasks to goals.
  For each task, ask “Why?”
  Knowing the why behind each task links it to goals.
  Goals = motivation = more productivity.
  * * *
  6. Stop overloading your list.
  Busy does not mean productive.
  3-5 major tasks and 1-2 minor tasks are enough.
  This prevents burnout and keeps you motivated.
  * * *
  7. Review your list at the end of the day.
  Look back at completed tasks.
  Celebrate the wins.
  Analyze what was missed.
  This makes the next day's list better.
  * * *
  Productivity is about focus, not the number of tasks. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnbtvws6p0m2apydwcf1t7ry))
