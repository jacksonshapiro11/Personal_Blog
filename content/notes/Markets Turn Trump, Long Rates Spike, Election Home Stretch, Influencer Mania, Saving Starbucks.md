### Highlights

- Embrace Independence or Risk Obsolescence
  Summary:
  Labor participation rates have plummeted, with many young people opting out of traditional career paths due to crushing debt and a perceived lack of opportunity within the established system.
  Increasingly, younger generations are not viewing jobs as their sole means of economic independence; instead, they cultivate side hustles or engage in speculative trading, believing they can build wealth outside traditional employment. A significant number of Gen Z members aspire to become influencers, reflecting a shift where traditional jobs are considered secondary to self-branding and entrepreneurship.
  Psychological differences are observed between younger workers, who tend to be more motivated and innovative, and those slightly older, who may exhibit lower motivation, partially due to previous generations’ experiences with debt and job insecurity.
  Engaging in side hustles can provide financial resilience; however, reliance on these can also lead to a lack of commitment and risk aversion that might prevent individuals from reaching their full potential.
  The best approach for young people is to find a career they are passionate about while simultaneously working to build a robust personal brand, balancing security with the courage to pursue ambitious goals without safety nets.

  Speaker 1
  But we peaked at 68%, 69% labor participation, and we're 10% off that, maybe more. Maybe we're at 61% or 62%. I think a lot of people are going to give up because the debt is going to be so crushing that the logical thing to do if you don't think you can get out from under it might be to move in with your Parents or two or three other people, tighten your belts and enjoy life and go skiing and go have experiences. And a lot of young people are electing to do that. In other words, they're opting out of the American dream.
  Speaker 4
  Sorry, to your point, the one thing that I realized with a lot of young men that, Jason, I think you're really hitting the nail on the head is a lot of them now do not view the job that they Do as their only path to economic independence. And if anything, they may do a job, but then they're actively trading on the side, something, crypto, options, whatever. They're on Robinhood, they're using Coinbase, because it's almost like they've separated in their mind that the job they do will never give them the financial independence they want. And so instead, they're going to do that job because they like it. Hopefully they love it. But then separately, they're going to go and speculate to try to make money. It's a really interesting thing because I had always been taught, you earn your wealth through the job you have. And so if you wanted to make more money, you have to ladder up and do something different. I think that that's not true. That that idea has been sort of decoupled. Now, that's a really interesting change in how people approach work.
  Speaker 1
  I call them gen bet. Like they're the generation that believes on there's just like subset of them. It's not all of them. A number of them are just quiet quitting. And they just don't believe in capitalism. And then there's this other group which are like trying to get control. I call them gen bet because they just want to bet on themselves. And, you know, if they don't get wrecked by the financial markets, trading options, you know, and doing the other thing I'll say just in recruiting a bunch of people at 80, 90 over the
  Speaker 4
  Last three or four months is there is an enormous difference that I have seen psychologically in the people that are 25 and older versus the people that are 25 and under. And I'm calling 25 as a rough number, but there are kids that are 18, 19, 20, 21 years old that are off the charts good. They're motivated. They're hungry. They're like, let's get after it. And they are honestly different in the way they approach their job than folks that are in their late 20s and early 30s.
  Speaker 1
  These folks are the first generation who didn't go into debt in college and didn't buy into that. Like, so they might, the millennials ahead of them might have like taken the bullets, you know?
  Speaker 4
  Yeah, the folks that are in their late 20s, early 30s, and I'm not trying to generalize or disparage, but they lack a level of motivation, again, generally speaking, that the youngest Folks in the workforce have. And that also that people in our generation sort of have. So they're sort of sandwiched in between a very different way of approaching work. And as a result, they stand out. And I don't think they're standing out for all the right reasons.
  Speaker 2
  Well, the majority now of young people, the number, I believe, and Nick, if you could pull this up, 57% of Gen Zers want to be influencers as their primary career now. That the idea of working a job is almost like a secondary option. The primary option that everyone would strive for is to be an influencer. And this number has grown considerably, continues to grow. And in fact, if you look at the rest of this report, this was out of a morning console.
  Speaker 1
  Did you say 50% of Gen Zers aspire to be influencers? Correct. Okay. 57%. As their career, or just they want to be influential and build a brand around themselves, I wonder. That's what they want to do for a living. That's what they would like to do. That's what they want their paycheck to be. Interesting. That's what they want their paycheck to be. They want to be independent, and they believe the system's rigged against them. And why wouldn't you think the system's rigged against you if you went $150K or $250K in debt and you couldn't get a good job?
  Speaker 2
  Sax, as a successful influencer, how would you advise the youth on their career choices? Well played.
  Speaker 3
  Yeah, look, I think that believing you're going to be an influencer is like believing that you're going to be like a rock star or movie actor or something like that.
  Speaker 2
  Pro-athlete? Pro-athlete, yeah.
  Speaker 3
  It's like a one in a million shot. It's just not a great thing to want to design your career around because it's just very unlikely to happen. So I think you're better off finding a career that you're passionate about, but where you're actually adding value. The world doesn't need 50 something percent of the population to become influencers. That's kind of crazy. It reminds me of a line from Fight Club where Tyler Durden says, we've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires and movie gods and rock stars, but We won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very pissed off. And that was gen x that was yeah so yeah that was they're headed for a uh a fight club like realization about this sex how do you advise a young person on there there's this temptation to
  Speaker 2
  Go and spend all this time making content and pursue that as your career and that's a life opportunity for you now it's more free and open they would think than perhaps being a movie star Or a basketball player used to be.
  Speaker 3
  So I think it's just important to recognize that if we ourselves are influencers, the reason why we're not being hypocritical is that none of us here, with the possible exception of JCal, ever set out to be influencers, right? We did something different. We actually had a career and we did something interesting. And then as a result of that, maybe people want to listen to our pod. The idea that you can just go be an influencer without having actually done anything interesting, what's your credential for that? So what I would advise is just people should go do something productive. And then, you know, if it leads to other people wanting to hear from them, then that that's good. But setting out to be someone that other people should listen to without having any experience or having done anything productive in your life, it's like, why should we listen to you?
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, one thing I did build and sell two out of my three businesses over the years. But there are 10s of millions of people making money in the long tail as a content creator and it's low thousands ... ([Time 0:28:54](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ef297e8a-6b16-44c9-a401-adee62b3d79c))
