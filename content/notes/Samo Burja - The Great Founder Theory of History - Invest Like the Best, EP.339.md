  His research focuses on institutions of the founders behind them, how they rise, and why they always fall in the end. As you'll hear, Samo has an encyclopedic grasp of history, and his work has led him to some fascinating theories about human progress, the nature of exceptional founders, and the future Of different societies across the world. Please enjoy my conversation with Samo Burjah. Samo, your writing has been amongst the most interesting that I've encountered in the last couple of years. Just a tremendous variety of ideas and ways of looking at the world and history. One of the overarching things that you're best known for is this lens on history, the co-great founder theory. I'd love you to just begin by laying out the core idea here, how you came upon the idea and maybe what it opposes, the alternative view of history, from the one that you've developed. I'd love to start there, and then we'll dive into lots of nooks and crannies together.
  Speaker 1
  To me, it seems that most of social science for the last hundred years has been focused on trying to find these macro deep patterns of human behavior, human history, sometimes being A hubristic to try to find immutable laws of history, such was the case in the early and the middle of the 20th century. While it certainly is the case that there are deep patterns that are worth studying in the nature of all civilization from the advent of agriculture to today, and while it certainly Is true again, that there is a deep current that's changing our society, that started with the Industrial Revolution 200 years ago. None of these patterns were seven stone, none of these patterns are fixed. I think none of them really rise to the level of sociological laws. The reason why we can't just predict future history for the next few hundred years is that people serve society and they come to alter it. Exceptional individuals, great man's theory of history sense, perhaps don't determine everything to how things transpire, but I think almost all of the exceptional institutions That have shaped human civilization, anything you can think of be it organized religion, technological companies, political systems, they usually have an individual or a small Group of people who deviate from the previous social norm, create a new type of organization, a new type of institution, or honestly just a new way of doing things as the old society fails. And we see this over and over again. Again, to give historical examples, it might take a very religious and legible form, such as creating, founding, the new organized religion. Say, for example, the comet reorganizing the tribal Arab societies into a cohesive unified whole tends of expanding and conquering most of the Middle East.

    - **Note:** Instead of studying history and looking for macro human trends study how great individuals have shaped history. Don’t study human nature but study confuscious or Muhammad as these guys are the ones who shaped society for thousands of years and if you remove them society and the world isn’t the same and history goes differently because they shape the institution. This isn’t just knowledge but looks at the shaping of the world and institutions. The great founder theory would look at a place like China and not think it would trend towards democracy but instead see the power of the ccp and its hegemony grow to shape the development of the country. Look at the leverage points and their goals. Lee kwon yu was an amazing individual who defined Singapore and the world but his playbook of more or less complete power has been run many other places and failed showing the importance of the individual in this procsss.
- The Influence of Submarine Civilizations and Great Founders in Human History
  Key takeaways:
  - Submarine civilizations have little impact on us today, except for influencing biblical myths of the great flood.
  - Throughout history, the impact of influential individuals can be charted, with most likely totaling around 500 people.
  - Great founders are life players who are not restricted by inherited scripts and can improvise and create new roles.
  - The ability to succeed in multiple unrelated industries is a strong indicator of being a live player.
  - There are currently only about 50,000 live players in the world, making them very rare.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Most of them, of course, long gone. No one is very much interested in Sumerian civilization, except as a historical case study today, it doesn't impact us in a perfect way, except perhaps in some ways influencing the Biblical myths of the great flood and so on. So then let's say that about 30 civilizations, some of them still relevant, some of them ancient history, each of them having probably something like 10 or so great founders. So I think for all of human history, if you were to chart the impact of these individuals, and again, I want to emphasize sometimes it's a small group of people, might be an individual Plus a few very close allies, or it might be a partnership of two lawgivers or anything like this, such small human clusters. I think we're talking about 500 people like most, 500 people at most for human history. And then for the term life player, all great founders are life players, not all life players are great founders. A life player is someone that is not operating off of an inherited script. An inherited script might be something like professionalism, political tradition. It can be anything. It can be a very successful script. If I am a surgeon and I work exactly as I was trained, I'll be doing a fairly good job. And I can repeat this exact program, this recipe that I've been taught, and of course, apply it in my domain with some creativity. And society basically functions on the top of such roles on surgeons, engineers, plumbers, but also lawyers, politicians, beasts. A life player though, is someone that can on the spot improvise, develop, and create new so-called roles. And one of the shortest indicators that someone is a live player is the ability to jump multiple industries. So if you see someone that's succeeded in one industry and gone to a totally unrelated field of activity and succeeded there as well, and then gone again and succeeded as well. It's very unlikely that's luck. And it's very unlikely that they're using the same recipe or the same insights for all three domains. And I think that's sort of the strongest evidence that some individuals can recreate patterns of behavior and improvise essentially in a way that's basically just very deep, very Groundbreaking. And I think the total number of live players in the world probably right now is closer to about 50,000 or so. So it's actually still extremely rare. A ([Time 0:19:16](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1b4f74bf-3ca5-4e3f-83ea-3467d1a5b7d4))
    - **Note:** Live players are people who are making a difference but not sticking to a script a surgeon is very talented but not a live player. There are few people who grab the institutions and create and develop new social roles. A live player can jump and succeed in multiple industries. Some individuals can create and improvise being a live player but it’s very rare.
- The Consequences of Deviating from Societal Norms
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  It is at least public slander and all the way to violent opposition. People will recognize breaking with a societal pattern as anti-social behavior. This is actually mostly correct. For most of how society operates, deviation is a pretty good marker that someone is basically behaving in bad faith, trying to take advantage of a system, not living up to whatever the ideals of the society are. But if you institute new ideals, these new ideals must necessarily be from the perspective of old ideals and norm violation. Say, Martin Luther, you probably won't be surprised that he had to flee several times in his life, faced a religious persecution, was in real danger of dying, being executed as a heretic multiple times in his life. But on the other hand, he was also such a combative, disagreeable person. Another feature is I think a lot of these people are quite unreasonable people. I think if you're a reasonable person, you adjust yourself to the world. Then if you're an unreasonable person, you try to adjust the world through yourself. It doesn't need to be egotistical. You might view yourself as a humble instrument of God. But let's be honest, viewing yourself as the humble instrument of God, reaching the truth to your society. That's pretty egotistical too. ([Time 0:33:24](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d11e6c8d-93e2-4a78-9a8a-c824d083546d))
    - **Note:** These live people shape the world around them and do so in an active way where the world is conforming to them. This egotism might be vital for these great individuals. People need to be immensely psychologically strong to do something of substance. This psychological toughness is vital but also most of the things in the world are right so you need to be where the area is ready for disruption and be a fuck you enough to do it. Technology moves in waves advancing and retracting with time being a dynamic system. Every institution has a succession issue the tech could be the same but if China took over the US the ethos and creativity would likely change due to the institution change.
- The Responsibility of Powerful Individuals
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I call it lock in an important sense because I don't think it's helpful or truthful to be excited by those opportunities. And I think the Oppenheimer mild dread of, wait, I have to figure this out. That's actually a much healthier one, though even that can go too far. And so because of that, I think that maybe the view should be that, okay, yes, all of these individuals are powerful. And the wisest of them also realized, though, that they are also responsible. In a way, my view of history is also like, kind of terrifying. It's like, okay, if you are a great founder, if you're one of 500 people in history, and if eventually people come to an accurate understanding of history, your role in human civilization will be accounted for. Wow, I don't even know what to say about that, right? I'm happy. I'm not in that position. Don't envy anyone happens to be in that position. Humanity is going to look at what you did.
  Speaker 2
  Can you define the idea of borrowed versus owned power for people? I think that's a super interesting concept.
  Speaker 1
  Own power is something that is sort of inherently within your reach. It is something that you have no difficulty defending and you really rely on very few people to carry it out. Borrowed power is wielding power on someone else's behalf. ([Time 0:51:38](https://share.snipd.com/snip/83692bd4-6a20-4428-969f-11a7a464f503))
    - **Note:** Owned power is agency over your power while borrowed power is derived from a person or situation. Power you pay people to do the work you can’t pay them to care. Some societies think you can reason through and understand things at a deep level but other societies believe the opposite. Static vs dynamic societies. Idea that societies are fighting for elite status and eventually so many people become elites by the old definition that they must fight ti develop a new idea of an elite.
