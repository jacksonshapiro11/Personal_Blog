### Highlights

- Do You Have Power?
  Key takeaways:
  - Herby's experience as a crossing guard at nine years old taught him a lifelong principle that power is based on perceptions and most people will obey any type of authority.
  - Herby's lesson to his son is to pretend to be in control even if one may not have actual authority.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  This was a story that happened when herby was nine years old. And the larry in story is larry king, his lifelong friend. They started debating in the street, arguing. Larry said that crossing kids on their way to school was busy work. It was a joke. So larry and herby had been made crossing guards by their school. And so their having this debate over whether they want to do it or not. And it says herby it's a position with real power, he said. Herby walked to the middle of nineteenth avenue and held up his hand, bringing traffic to a stop. It is simple as this. Herby said, he was proving what would become a lifelong principle, most people are shmucks and will obey any type of authority, even if just a nine year old in an orange sash. As he'd say later in lectures, power is based on perceptions. If you think you've got it, you've got it, even if you don't got it. Cars and trucks were soon backed up for blocks. And the way i would summarize the lesson that he's trying to teach his son is t pretend to be in control, and peoplewill assume that you are. So that reminded me of this thing i read in steve job's biography by walter isaacson, where nolan bushnow the founder of a tory, is talking about meeting steve. So nolan's like, you know, maybe a decade older than steve was, and he hires, like, a 19 year old steve jobs to work at a tory. And he said, tat there was something indefinable in an onch preneur. And he saw that characteristic in steve jobbs, even when steve was really young. And nolan gave him advice that steve use for his entire life. If he read any biography of steve jobbs, was obvious. And nolan said, i taught him that if you actually you can do something, then it will work. I told him, pretend to be completely in trol, and people will assume that you are.

    - **Note:** Power is based on perception people are schmucks and will generally believe you. Pretend to be control and people will believe you.
