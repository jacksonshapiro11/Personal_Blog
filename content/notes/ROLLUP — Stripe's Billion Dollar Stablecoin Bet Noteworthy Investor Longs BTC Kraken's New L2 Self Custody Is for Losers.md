### Highlights

- Beware the Rise of Bitcoin: A Threat to Central Control
  Summary:
  Recent discussions among central bankers highlight the emerging tensions surrounding Bitcoin and its implications for monetary control and wealth distribution.
  The European Central Bank's paper suggests that Bitcoin's rise represents a wealth redistribution mechanism that may undermine traditional authority by concentrating assets in the hands of early adopters. This could provoke calls for policies to curb or eliminate Bitcoin's growth to preserve societal stability and prevent further economic inequality.
  In parallel, a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis warns that Bitcoin could hinder government deficit spending and fiscal policy flexibility, advocating for its prohibition or taxation.
  These developments indicate that central bankers are beginning to take Bitcoin seriously, suggesting a transition into a confrontational phase against its wider adoption.
  Conversely, innovative applications of blockchain technology, such as Buenos Aires' Quark ID, demonstrate a significant and positive use case for cryptocurrencies, enabling citizens to manage their identities securely and privately without exposing unnecessary personal information. The shift toward using zero-knowledge proofs represents a promising evolution in protecting individual privacy against data theft and privacy breaches inherent in traditional financial systems. This dual narrative illustrates the growing conflict between centralized authority seeking to maintain control over financial systems and individuals leveraging decentralized technology to assert their rights and privacy.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  I think we are getting even closer to the then they fight you phase. There were two interesting papers released this week, one by the European Central Bank that claimed that those who acquired Bitcoin at an earlier date, basically it was an unfair system Because non-holders should recognize, they said, that Bitcoin's rise is fueled by wealth redistribution at their expense. There are compelling reasons to advocate for policies that curb Bitcoin's growth or even eliminate it. The stakes are high. Pro-Bitcoin politicians could skew wealth distribution further, threatening societal stability if non-holders don't push back. So this is a European central banker authoring a paper that's saying basically like hard money, strong property rights outside of the hands of the central bankers and the nation state Is like we can't move the dials as much on wealth redistribution. So kind of like waking up and realizing that. Simultaneously last week, I thought this was a really interesting paper from the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Recall the Federal Reserve Bank has all of these kind of like regional chapters, and this is one of them. And they produced a paper that suggested that assets like Bitcoin should be taxed or banned in order to help governments maintain deficits, help them maintain. This is them staying the quiet part out loud again. So they said in an economy where the government tries to maintain permanent deficits using nominal debt, Bitcoin creates problems for policy implementation. And this is a quote. It introduces balanced budget trap, an alternative state where the government is forced to balance its budget. Oh, no. An alternative where the government is forced to balance its budget. We have to balance our budget? Oh, no. And so what do they recommend in their conclusion? They recommend, and this is a quote, a legal prohibition against Bitcoin that can restore unique implementation of permanent primary deficits or also a direct tax on bitcoin they're Basically saying like hey if this whole crypto bitcoin thing takes off then we lose the ability to print money run this thing at deficit and print money and it's like yeah that's what We've been saying yeah yeah that's why we're here that's what we've been saying the entire time so but at first they were ignoring it. Then they were kind of laughing at it. And now I think we are moving this week by week. We'll see this and probably over years and maybe over decades. The central bankers are like, oh, shoot, this is this is picking up. This is actually working. And they'll shift more into the now they fight us phase. We'll see how that goes.
  Speaker 1
  I just love it when we watch like nation state and powers that be just like tussle with this idea of Bitcoin. Remember that quote like two or three weeks ago where one of the risks of the IMF saw of Bitcoin El Salvador is that like we need to control public access to Bitcoin. It's like you just think that you can do that? This the statements that they're making just are just super indicative of exactly the thesis of permissionless finance permissionless money uh money on the internet and this is like
  Speaker 2
  You guys are just saying this yeah i can't believe they're saying this out loud like i thought this was all in smoke filled rooms but nope they're actually saying that this will allow Them to no longer print as much money as they want to.
  Speaker 1
  That's so funny. All right. A tale of two governments, a tale of two powers that be. On the flip side of things, the city of Buenos Aires, which has 3.6 million citizens, by the way, is the first city to issue digital IDs to its citizens. So there is this application app called Quark ID inside of Buenos Aires. It's a local app for accessing municipal services, documents, documents like your birth records, documents like healthcare records, driver's licenses. And so all of this is going on chain with verifiable credentials and ZK proofs to let users show that a document has indeed been authenticated by the government without disclosing the Information that is relevant to the task at hand. I love that use case. The classic example of like, okay, like why, how can zero knowledge proofs be used to help people in their daily lives? The classic example is when I'm going up to a bar and they say, ID, please, let me check if you're 20, old or not. What are they also getting with my ID? They're getting my name, my last name, my birth, my birth date, my address. Your photo. Your eyes. They're orbing you, basically. Eyes, yeah. And all they need to know is this binary, are you over or not over 21? That's the only thing that they need to know. You disclose all this extra information, mainly your address being the big one. Yep.
  Speaker 2
  And so ZK Proofs has been like, well, you can actually just submit a proof zk proof to tell somebody if you are are indeed over or not over they don't need to know all of the rest of the information
  Speaker 1
  It's just a binary yes is over 21 or no is not yes correct uh and this is what is being rolled out to 3.6 million citizens of buenos are so what kind of documents can be stored there? They say over 60 different types, birth certificates, gross income taxes, vaccination data. But also importantly, no third party, not even the municipality of Buenos Aires has control over the documents. So the documents are trustless. So cool. They're trustless. Once they are issued by the government, they are bearer assets by the account that controls them. Thanks to the ZK proof system, user data is protected against identity theft and data tampering, which is so sick. All of this is deployed on ZK Sync. I think one of the cooler wins of the crypto industry coming out of ZK Sync here, my prediction here, this is on Zk sync era i think quark id is going to eventually in the future this is my Hypothesis my my prediction uh quark id will make the quark id zk chain on the elastic chain and then we will have the chain for buenos aries and then therefore argentina argentina's
  Speaker 2
  Getting the chain and protecting uh citizen privacy at kind of the the base level you know one of the most dystopian things I do in like modern life is, and I must do this like multiple times A month now, whenever I'm like moving money with like TradFi or like getting, you know, credit investor or something like this, you have to do the, your selfie of yourself and you submit Your driver's license or your passport and they do the selfie of you...

    - **Note:** This is wild. controlling public access to bitcoi. This is super cool using zk proofs to verify identity.
