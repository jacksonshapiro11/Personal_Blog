  What are some of the other ways that you recommend people try to build use tools that people use to build new friendships? Yeah.

  So I can walk through my own experience of making a bunch of friends and share this in a story. I went to Mexico City alone and was there for 10 days and was like, okay, if I spend 10 days here and don't make any friends, I'm going to be very lonely. So how did I make friends when I was there? First I went to a coffee shop. I heard another American there and I knew, you know, he's less likely to drag me than I think. I also knew the research on transitioners, right? People that are in times of transition are most open to friendship. So people that are traveling, people that have just moved to the city, people that have just started school, people that have just retired, right? Those are the people to try to connect with versus, you know, someone who's been here for a while and already has an established network. So I knew this guy's a transitioner and he's less likely to reject me than I think. So I'm going to engage with him and I ask, you know, where are you from? Like I'm from the US too. You start chatting and I end up inviting him to a meetup that night. And it's like a language exchange meetup. And that language exchange meetup, I meet someone else who's cool. And I say, you know, do you want to come to this Lucha Libre wrestling match with me? And he said yes. And I think, you know, what I realized too, from the research on friendship, I used to think that making friends was about being interesting, being smart, being insightful, being charismatic, being entertaining. But in fact, people report that this entertainment factor is the least important quality they look for in a friend. And the most important quality that they look for is someone who makes them feel like they matter. So for me, if I want to connect with someone, it's not about me trying to impress them. It's about me trying to make them feel valued and, you know, say hello to them and engage with them and tell them what I like about them and tell them what I appreciate about them, right? Like, you know, there's a study that looked at friendship budding friendship groups for like 12 weeks, which of these pairs ended up becoming friends. And it was the ones that shared the most affirmation and affection towards each other, right? And so it's, and just to go even deeper into the research rabbit hole, there's a theory called risk regulation theory, which indicates that we decide how much to invest in a relationship based on our view of how likely we are to get rejected. So when we show people, I like you, we're telling them, hey, you're not going to get rejected if you try to be friends with me. And that makes people really want to feel safe, really feel safe connecting with us, right? So, so I was both engaging with these people and I was trying to make them feel loved and tell them how great I thought they were and how happy I am to meet them as I reached out to them. And then I went to my Spanish class, which if you don't have any friends, what I recommend is that you join something that's repeated over time. And remember, I said repeated unplanned interaction shared vulnerability is that infrastructure that kids have for friends that we lack as adults. So as adults, we really need to recreate that infrastructure. And so if you join like a social group that's repeated over time, turn your hobby into a community, right? That's a really important way to make friends. So for me, it's I want to take the Spanish class because I love learning languages. For you, it might be football team, improv team, hiking team, meditation group, but it's just finding something, finding a group that meets around this hobby because when you find something that's repeated over time, what happens is something called the mere exposure effect sense in the mere exposure effect describes our tendency to unconsciously, completely unconsciously like people just because they are familiar to us. So for example, this researcher found that when he planted women into a large psychology lecture at the end of the semester, none of the students remembered the woman, but they reported liking the woman who showed up to the most classes, 20% more than the woman that didn't show up for any, right? Nobody remembered her, but they liked her a lot because they had seen our face like this is our brain, right? And what I think the other implication of mere exposure effect is in the beginning, mere exposure effect hasn't set in. So it's going to be awkward. It's going to be weary. You're going to feel uncomfortable, right? Maybe a little distrusting. That's not a sign that you need to stop showing up. That's a sign you need to keep showing up because when you continue to show up, they're going to like you more. You're going to like them more, right? So I joined that Spanish class. That was repeated over time. Everyday in Spanish class, I would ask people to go out to lunch with me, we go out to lunch together, then we went to Lucha Libre together. You know, of course I was only there for 10 days, so there's only, I can only go so deep with with folks. But in general, when you join this event that's repeated over time, you want to start generating exclusivity with someone in that group. Exclusivity means you develop memories and you develop experiences with one person in the group that you don't have with other people. So pick whoever in the group that you really liked and ask them, oh, would you be open to like getting coffee, getting tea, like before or after our next group? Like I love to hang out and those are like the budding stems of friendship. And luckily, if you're in this group, right, you don't have to put in as much effort and now you had your tea and now you're going to just continue to see them over time and you have the wheel start moving for friendship and connection.

    - **Note:** Most important thing is to make others feel like they matter. Affirmation and effection sharing. We invest in relationships in which we feel safe no rejection. Turn your hobby into a community. Mere exposure is beneficial to building friendships.
