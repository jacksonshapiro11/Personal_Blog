### Highlights

- Likely to understand minds we need to understand the wider environment we can look at neurons to see someone is looking at a tree but we actually still need to know what a tree is to have context. This is true with everything in life. We don’t just see but see as so to understand the mind we need a broad approach. We are more than neurochemistry can’t understand everything from that. We react differently to moral and immoral things but because morality is relative there is a factor outside our minds. Minds are more than brains they are shaped by their environment. The idea of the self being was an enlightenment idea of Locke around an integrated person that changed societies perspective. Democratized the self. This came with the death of the self as well from Spinoza who said we can be held or enthralled in unclear unconscious or half conscious ideas. We can only free ourselves when we understand these ideas clearly which frees ourselves. Understanding what has a hold on your mind to get out of your mental prison. Free ourselves and seek truth. We also need to understand how we’re at the center of our own universe and that perception. Why is a sense of self and feeling we are feeling so central to human experience. Then we have a feeling of knowing. Levels of consciousness like core the animalistic self and extended consciousness the autobiographical self. Our conscious brain tries to make sense of innate reactions post reaction. We think we saw a snake we get a reflex triggered first then we have to explain it. Narrative fallacy. Gambler fallacy also an example of this fallacy.

    - **Note:** We understanding things in context. We can only comprehend things we understand. We see and understand its a 2 part process. We can't deduce all thoughts and feelings just from the brain. Minds are brains in the environment. The enlightenment led to the invention of the self but also the Death of the self. We must free ourselves through seeking truth. We exist at the center of our universe. Feeling is central to the human experience. We have innate reactions
- Another model is recurrent processing in sensory areas of the brain that feeds forward and back relevant info. Feed forward takes data like light and makes shapes and connections feedback sends info back to the motor outter edges also horizontal connections. Integrated information theory starts with consciousness itself then inverts. Consciousness is described as axioms that its real structured specific integrated and definite as the essential nature of consciousness. Consciousness is the integration of information through different neural circuits interconnecting that can be seen. We see when we’re asleep or in an unconscious state the entire neural circuit doesn’t light up just that one brain region but to be conscious our entire brain lights up. Our brains are probabilistic machines taking input from the outside world making predictions then adjusting to the outside world. Goedl no set a proofs of logic in a formal system can be sufficient to prove the entire system as consistent. No sets of rules can ever prove a system.
- Consciousness could be an immaterial principle, like the soul colluding with the body, a vapor injecting life into you a physical form of consciousness sent from the brain of the body physical manifestation of consciousness, the third is to ignore and accept the world as it is. Our bodies and our personalities change, but we have one consciousness so it’s clear we are changing. Lock argued, consciousness is memory awareness, and self interest for the future. You are privy to yourself and know yourself to be you. It made memory the basis of identity vs the previously believed opposite idea. Awareness is of an object of attention and the state of being in that quality. Contrast states are directed upon something like the breath in meditation. Second type is Qualia, the states of being experienced properties and feeling and the safe of consciousness what it feels like to be in pain to see a red dress or drink a beer. The experience of Qualia is phenomenal consciousness. The subject can introspect the feeling too. We can also just access consciousness without monitoring it like being in flow. Consciousness goal is when a 3rd party can understand conscious states without any first person introspection or input. 3rd person brain states align behavior with a brain. This is the grail of understanding consciousness. One model of consciousness is the brain web model of neural networks with different areas processing different info. Info becomes conscious when neural circuits that represent info are mobilized by top down intentional amplification by a brain scale state of coherence that involves many distributed neurons. Brain workspace says consciousness is a function of integration at a global level of activity. This is a functional definition but doesn’t explain Qualia.
    - **Tags:** #neuroscience, #qualia, #explanatory-knowledge, #consciousness, #memorization, #change-and-identity
    - **Note:** Consciousness is an interesting thing that we know exists but we cannot fully explain even now. It is innate within us but we don't know fully why. We can explain how we understand things through neural netowrks but that doesn't explain qualia and feelings. Consciousness has to do with some memory of yourself like change being a leaf that turns brown not is brown its connected but also losing memory can still be conscious. We will understand it when we can model it
- Memory for different things like childhood memory spacial memory what you did yesterday is in different places and there is a benefit to forgetting to allow things to come into the mind. Like old people not remembering breakfast but the war. Different kind and uses of memory some is procedural and some is more rote like a phone number. We can forget because we didn’t receive the information right or forget for effiency. Possible to try to forget but unclear. Forgetting is tied with false remembering when you prompt people with ideas like bed night ect. And they swear you said sleep when you never did. Recovered memory therapy has issues because it’s so easy to convince ourselves of things that never happened we can do easily fabricate experiences in our minds that never happened and swear they did that is why people are so influencable. None of the stories regarding this therapy have been coroberated. This shows how easily we fool ourselves to our detriment. Confabulation isn’t lying because you swear it’s true. We as neuroscientists understand that events leave imprints on our brains but don’t know how or where and can’t see it. We must assume we don’t know where these are yet but eventually can understand it with time. We are basically reductionist in the conclusion of understanding all brain activity by the brain. This minimizes the ability for bodily complex interactions and emergent phenomena by saying it’s just the brain. We mauve can’t understand the feeling of consciousness from just looking at neurons. What does being in a state mean some people think these states are similar to demonic possession in older terms and these states can be understood with chemicals. Others argue these states of mind are complexly connected and are indespensible cannot be thrown out. Theories of mind like a cat meow near the bowl mean it wants food reduces complex thought to simple models creating value that may be indiscernible to even an expert in an mri. These models of thought have proved very beneficial for many mental phenomena theory of mind helped understand autism and then we could map that onto areas of the brain in some regard. Good place to start. Both approaches have their uses. Neuroscience is exposed to so many cognitive biases because the space is so small and unclear so we need to be actively very skeptical and maintain doubt always. But everyone knows this so it’s not flying under the radar meaning it has a less horrible biased effect.
- Aristotle saw the heart and the center of body and the brain was a cool organ the balanced the hot heart golden mean. The mind is the principle and anima the thing that makes things alive. Focused on motion and change. Motion and change are big concepts for him. Mind body dualism was Descartes idea and this has lead to some confusing explanations among religion where people have tried to fit their views into this paradigm with less than compelling explanations. Behaviorism and untangling the brain and its signals. The study of the brain has proven it to be the center of cognition not the heart but it took all of human history to come to that consensus. Neuron sends through axons receives through dendrites. Action potentials are sent and these only vary in number not amplitude like Morse code without the dashes just the dots. All neurons communicate with 10k others and there are 100bn total neurons. Simple communication power lies in connections and complex interactions. Neurons are sensory motor or inter neurons. One for sight ect the other for muscle action the last acting as the connective tissue between neurons. The brain is a network of networks in many ways but it’s obviously more complex but hubs activities for functions and spokes makes some logical sense. Everything we experience in the world is a creation of our brain. Neurons have special functions a neuron area discerns lines and thus was discovered by accident through curiosity and the scientists win a Nobel prize for this accident. The brain can solve and fill in things or block out things through its blind spots. Think the gorilla experiment but it also works the opposite way when you don’t have the full picture. Many different complex areas of the brain. When we are asked to imagine something our visual neurons fire. This is an example of how complex the brain is. There is so much that goes into the brains perception even if it seems basic. Vision is a cognitive process we don’t just see we see as. Like seeing someone hitting on our girlfriend is more than just visual perception it’s a lot of reactions.

    - **Note:** Aristotle thought the heart was the balance to the head. Then there was the idea of mind body dualism. Motion and change are essential to life. Then goes into neuroscience how its all in the connections. We have so many neurons and its a network of networks. This goes into how the brain works. The brain is very complex and our perception shapes reality. Our brains can fill things in or filter things out like the gorilla. Everything we see is our perception of our reality.
- History the map isn’t the territory. Human commonalities like love and grief pleasure and pain are innate in humans. Human nature remains constant. We project our current time on the past in trying to understand them. The reading in problem there isn’t enough info so we need to make assumptions which invites bias with no justification. We have no clue why Stonehenge exists but we read in and assume it’s religious. One issue is research funded by biased institutions leads to biased research like money coming from a religiously minddd institution. Another is the lamp light problem we can only look for non perishable society but most of society is perishable. What are we missing. Modern human behavior uses symbolic thought to create thinks like ornament tool making art funeral practices. Symbolic communication is a big step forward for humanity and happened among maybe Neanderthals too. Tough to tell if this was an anatomic or social but using symbols like language enabled societal complexity. Due to new techniques archeology is becoming more scientific. Archeology is about attributing meaning and making sense. Defensibility open to refutation and contradiction with better arguments. There is only one method and that is to be intelligent. All other methods are serving that purpose. Just do what best serves the truth seeking. Knowledge needs logic means and careful methods to prove itsekd. .

    - **Note:** Understanding the past is complex because the map is not territory, but we must read in an extrapolate. Human nature never changes and knowledge is projection. Bias, inherent, in models. History is hard because we weren’t there. Lamp, light problem. We only look where we can find and is easy. Symbolic communication. Critical approach. There are so many lenses. We look at history through, but we need to understand that will never have the full picture while trying to piece that picture together.
- The past is a creation of the present if we can’t agree on eyewitness testimony, how can we agree what happened Thousands of years ago. Our view of the past is so biased and likely very wrong. The study of history tells us more about ourselves than our past. Historicos popular narrative historians and historians more academic archival people. Need to balance anecdotes with study. You can study history as a social science when you’re trying to think and get into the minds of people in the past or a factual science. Facts vs empathy so you can learn and create sympathy and create objective facts because human nature remains constant despite studying people and actions and intentions are clear to us as humans. Historians project on their work. Philosophy of history is coming up with human laws from learning. Theories of history like Marx and Hagel predict the world based on these laws creating an end of history which is different than just human nature. This is also like the idea of the messiah returning. This is predictive history not rational history. Are the natives savages that need to be killed or guilty for crimes or are they just defending their land that they feel rightfully theirs. This is too unclear even in the current moment of history being recorded so how hard is it after the fact to make these determinations. So many biasss perspectives in history. Reconfiguring history as educating savages versus invasions of land. History can be written by the victors which can leave out an entire perspective or ignore facts. The holocaust was very close documented but this was still denied despite clear evidence. This is projecting your believers without actual evidence. Fitting your beliefs to whatever evidence you can find for them. There are 2 types of recounting history denial and revisal. Revision is a matter more of perspective and intellectual honesty and not having all of the perspectives you need denial is more erasing history. Deliberately falsifying information is denial. Revision vs denial. There are so many examples of history like this like the Chinese, keeping things out of history or the basks in Spain or the natives in the US and history is just so biased and both sides argue for its bias so it’s hard to understand the picture. most of the people in history were peasants completely left out of it and disregarded those people are the equivalent of us.
- The yamnaya were the cultural ancestors of all of us, but weren’t in Europe until 5000 years ago so something weird happened with them. They also have native American genes showing they may have been migrating east and west from siberia to conquer. Sanskrit is the intellectual father of both Greek and Latin which much overlap in the worlds. Kentem languages are the western and Germanic languages Greek Latin Yiddish Celtic and other Germanic. Santem languages are more middle eastern Iranian and Indian like Farsi Bengali and Slavic languages. Language spoken or written isn’t proof speaker moved into that areas. Like English becoming the majority language in India or English in the US when a large part of the population was Germanic. Language and population don’t go hand and hand. This language was carried across the world by the yamnaya
    - **Tags:** #ancient-history, #language, #migration-of-people
    - **Note:** The history of language and movement of people throughout the world. Unclear where we are culturally from but we have some insights.
- History got longer the older civilization progressed. The Greeks only had a history of 500 years before them, but by the 18th century and into the 19th people started to believe the humans have been around longer than many thought, and the Bible said the Bible was certainly one of the things tamping down historical investigation. An interesting point was that despite history not being passed down the concepts in history were there were floods in Greek mythology that made its way into the Bible that were found in Sumer and that was the latest historical record we had but doesn’t mean that it wasn’t older, despite having no knowledge, the implicit knowledge, and ideas were passed down. Sargon, the great was the first person to conquer and unite and Empire the known universe and Babylonian Kings took his lineage for 1500 years after and his legitimacy first example of conquest and near the start of history, The epic of Gilgamesh was like homer’s Odyssey or the Bible to the Greeks, and that it was a central text at the heart of who the civilization was. This was center to the Self conception of who the civilization was. This book had Seminole themes as well as art and architecture. Code of hamraubi was one of the first codes that created punishment for crime. The bronze age had Rich trade mostly in copper, but the world was very connected at this point and before the iron age there was a big event that split everyone apart and refractured the world that had come together, but there was complex Bronze Age trade. The sea people invaded the western and Middle East in 1200 bce basically destroying destroying big populations centers killing big cities and weakening many others. People now thing it wasn’t a coordinated attack but climate change that brought about unrest food shortages and refuges came which weakened the region then a smaller invasion finished offf the decline in progress. Because the world was so interconnected that it all fell apart. Trade stopped and everything collapsed. This led to a massive dark ages writing was lost architecture was lost it took 500 years for people to form some sort of hierarchy and bury the dead with goods showing surplus’s wealth. Loss of writing is a big evidence of decline. This was a fully systems collapse fragile dependencies fully interconnected and over specialization. It was fragile and didn’t take much to break.

    - **Note:** History gets longer the more we know. Ironically the bible made people think history started much later and may have hidden investigation but we now know history is much longer. The themes learned from the past like floors were passes down through implcit knowledge. There are paradigm books that shape society like the bible, epic of Gilgamesh, or odyssey and this. We see the first codes through time and the bronze age trade. History is unclear but there was a massive event that split society in the iron age. The bronze age was very interconnected and then famine and illness may have lead to weakness and the society was killed. When the trade stipped everything collapsed and led to a 500 year dark age for people to start to create a society again instead of just subsisting. People need surpluss wealth to be independent and specialize. Loss of writing the sign of decline
- Weak Anthropic principle states that the world has the constants it does because we exist so we observe them. The strong anthropomorphic principle implies strong determinism in the universe. The anthropic principle tries to explain why the universe is the way it is. Like we exist but are the until conditions for life forced and deterministic or random numbers we give too much predictive agency or credit. Life is a process not a thing. Our view of life being carbon based is just projection not science. Life existing here may just be a probablistic inevitability given the initial conditions not some fine tuned constants. The nose wasn’t invented for people to wear glasses. Were always looking for the one true thing that explains the universe since Thales. Humans have the desire to think there is one answer. We are looking for a simple fundamental unifying theory but this might be wrong. Likewise we can see the world in a deep simple way. Genius makes the complex simple but somethings are irreducibly complex is the tension. Theories build on each other and have more reach. Stand on the shoulder of giants. There is a chance we don’t understand 95% of all stuff in the universe between latent energy and dark matter which we know nothing about we can only predict 5%. Our science makes us assume there are issues with our approach. 1. We aren’t smart enough to understand this stuff (pessimistic) 2. We drag new models through the pinhole reducing them too much losing knowledge 3. That nature of to inconsistent or incoherent to understand 4. We are still at a primitive age of science. 2 and 4 more likely. Do we need just one unifying theory or is that dumb.
- We organize the world into spaciotempral zones but to think that is fully reality is crazy. There is so much more ther we can’t understand because we can’t perceive it. Sometimes it is reality but a small part like an h2o molecule in the ocean is a sliver of reality or latitude and longitude being the map of reality that is simplified but not real. Either all our theories are wrong or our concepts of thiugh impose a world view that is too linear causal and ordered for the quantum world because it was trained in the classic one and doesn’t have the right first principle mental models to even understand the world. Imposing these ideas is like using dog grooming to solving quadratic equations. It’s not just shut up and calculate like insteanentslism but recognizing we have adapted to live in a narrow band but the world exists far outside that. Think of how much light exists vs what we can perceive. It’s literally impossible for us to see some of these colors. Our cognitive equipment isn’t configured that way but math can be. Math can predict nature. We have concepts like parliament which are real but also aren’t they’re only real because we believe it’s real. If we all stoped believing at a societal level it would be reduced to a useless idea. Changing the minds across society is hard. We can’t wish it a way but it is a construct of our agreements between people in society. While it exists though it is as real as a mountain based on our tacit and explicit understanding and arguments for society. There is a difference between a mountain and social institution. They are both real constructions that exists One is fully from input data the other is a projection of society as as fictitious as a novel from societal rules created like a novel is. We carve up the fundamental data which is events and interactions between events according to needs and interests at our scale. Until needs and interests introduce the refinements for the optimal degree of pluralism or proper nuance to our ontology, theory of what exist, we are left to see bookselfs as snakes not books. Our nervous system has no necessary division between books and bookselfs. We only conceive what has utility our sorting principle is just utility that is how we sort. It is the ultimate sorting function. If not useful we don’t care.

    - **Note:** Humans only categorize and understand what matters. We do not name or conceive what is not valuable to us. To think our perceived reality is true reality is crazy they're all simplified models. Our simplified theories don't explain reality and we need new theories and thinking our linear perception can explain non linear quantum physics is crazy. Much like we cant understand quantum we cannot see colors outside of our visual field they are the same concept. Some concepts we have are real like social institutions but also not real somehow as real as mountains but also can crumble this is the idea of societal paradigms that dictate every interaction but can completely upended in one second. Until we have the need to see the world in a certain way we won't be able to differentiate snakes and bookshelves our models are bounded and lazy. Theories as bounded rationality.
- We might not have the right tools to concieve or measure quantum phenomena. Need to review this. We are built and our language is built to see the world we live in and because the quantum realm is at a different level it’s not even in the perception of our lexicon. Math is beneficial because unlike language its patterns based not perception based. When we don’t have the idea for something in our heads it doesn’t exist. Math has alllwed us to discover particles through matter and anti matter. Because it’s so patterned and predictive it can make discoveries that our perceptual brains can’t. This is why we saw positrons and predicted anti gravity with math not perception because we couldn’t see it with our perception but we could through the patterns of reality. Kant blended empirical experience with perceptual reality. We only see what we can understand. A person from the Amazon jungle doesn’t see a book in a library but only sees what could be weird looking snakes they don’t even have the model for a row of books and can’t see a book individually. The neurons in the brain just don’t fire that way or have that connection so maybe we can’t understand the quantum world because our brain is wired to see the perceptual world where the quantum world is more abstract patterns than our traditional adaptations. We were trying to map quantum to classical which is like trying to map numenal to phenomenal reality. We need different tools perceptions and perspectives to understand the world. Mathematics allows us to see from a different perspective in a different language so mathematical proofs can be as valid as perceptual experiments. We don’t need to map a theory through the pinhole of classical experience we can see with different lenses. Math is a way of seeing. At the frontier we always have perception vs reason problems. We’re at the edge of our knowledge reason outstrips experience. There’s no way to outstrip imagination at the frontier you need it even if crazy and unfounded because crazy ideas are what drive the world forward after being looked into. Even the craziest ideas like the radiation from the Big Bang was tested today. Which seems impossible so no idea is too crazy. This test and idea unlocked so many secrets about the universe.

    - **Note:** Quantum physics is weird because we may not fully understand or even be able to understand it through our normal models of reality because its so outside of it so we need to look at other models of reality and this is where math becomes beneficial because its a different model that clarifies our thinking. We only see things through our models and need to have something in our perception to manifest it in reality. When things are too far outside of your circle of competence might as well be another language. Currently at the edge of our knowledge reason about things like the big bang out shapes any experience we can have. When you are at this edge you need to think outside the box and entertain the crazy ideas. We need to invent new models and destroy the old we cannot map the old to the new and think it'll work
      Perception shapes reality and having different models/ cross disciplinary thinking is vital. Quantum physics and crazy ideas.
- Falsifiability for popper could be viewed the same way confirmation is as it brings you one step closer or farther and falsifiability isn’t a death sentence but a correction. Good science builds on work before. We need to be aware of our biases inherent in our models and limited world view. How the world appears to us is a construct of our cognitive capacities. Kant. The world we perceive is conditioned by the manner of us perceiving it. Perception vs interpretation tools in the right people’s hands. A physicist sees the world clearly through the complex tools at cern that adds to their perception but to us those are just nonsense number. Cognition influenced by our previous experience and cognitive capacities. What we know influences experience interpretation is experience. We look through all our past experiences and project those onto the current moment and observation. That allows us to understand what that thing means which is unique to us. The possession of our cognitive architecture gives us the possibility for interpretation of experience. Provides the initial conditions for thought. This may make understanding the quantum realm harder because our normal experience is in the classical world and the quantum world is so far outside our lexicon of perception. He’s arguing here that seeing the world through our models and perceptions may bind us from fully seeing the world. When you look at the world through parliament ect. This thing doesn’t exist but it runs the country. If we all agreed it wasn’t a thing then it would disappear such he argues with our perception. We can see the quantum world with our brains but we just need to create models and tools that give us a different perspective and perception to do so properly. We aren’t unable physically but unwilling to reconstruct our perception bottoms up which might be needed.
- The laws of physics is the same for every person in the same frame of reference but the speed of light is absolute. This means times moves differently to different people. Time is slower in a moving vehicle than standing on the ground. Objects grow shorter in the direction they’re moving. Things can’t happen simultaneously. Things that happen at the same time for one observer may be at different times for another observer. Mass and energy are equivalent and interconvertable e=mc^2. Newtonian physics works at slower speeds but breaks down closer to the speed of light. Space time is curved and gravitational is the effect of this curvature. Einsteins ideas predict certain things that actually happened and were low probability showing it’s a good theory. When a star loses its fuel gravity pulls it in it collapses in on itself then the star explodes as a super nova and a black hole is formed in its wake with a pull so great not even light can achieve an escape velocity to leave it. Big bang theory. Light gets more blue the closer it gets and red the further it gets so red shift means receding. Universe is expanding. Black holes and event horizons could’ve been the beginning of our universe. String theory has been a theory used to unite quantum physics and general relativity but the issue is it doesn’t make predictions or have equations just elegant theory which some people defend as enough but that isn’t science.

    - **Note:** Science and physics knowledge. Some things are relative to the observer and other things the absolute laws of physics. Observer sees things differently from different areas. Newtonian physics works at slower not faster speeds. Good theory are low probability and predictive. Redshift in light is how we tell the universe is expanding. Stars collapse into blackholes where gravity pulls everything down so much light cant escape. String theory is a nice theory but bad science
- Even the agonists preferred reductionism to complexity. Maybe this is innate human nature. There was the great one ness of the world and the void. The issue to why science didn’t make progress is that the density of people and quality of experiments was too low so it never reached an activation energy. Critical mass of smart people. Physics is quanta of energy which was an originally simplified model that got adopted. Wave partial duality. Uncertainty principle. Quantum systems don’t have a measurement until measured. It needs an observer. Copenhagen interpretation reduces complexity by just accepting it and moving on. The idea that we need to accept quantum systems are indetermine until measured. Possible explanation is the many worlds hypothesis that atoms exist in many universes and we reduce down to 1 on observation. Instrumentalism is the Copenhagen interpretation that says it works so accept it does and don’t think too much. Consistent histories theory de coherence histories. The quantum event acts as the observer of it so it adopts a classical state. David burm thoery Universe has a deep deterministic underlying quantum potential quantum order that connects everything creating a deterministic world. Universe is an implicit order. Einstein hated interpretations of quantum mechanics that made the world seem probablistic. He thought it was fully deterministic. Hate’s people thought it could be probablistic. We don’t understand quantum physics and experiments have disproven Einsteins deterministic explanation due to the epr eistein podolsky Rosenberg effect being proved correct shows how little we know about quantum physics. Epr effect says super luminal transference of information is impossible because inform needs to travel faster than the speed of light but it exists. When you fire 2 particles that just interacted in exactly opposite spin states and measure one fixing its state the other particle is instantaneous put in the other exact opposite state without anything being exchanged at the speed of light. change one the other changes in the same way but that information would have to travel faster than the speed of light so it seems impossible yet it’s true and proved by experiment. So we’re like wtf how is this true Also quantum physics and general relativity are at odds with each other and they’re the 2 most fundamental theories we have about reality.
- Religion is a 1. deity replacing human agency and 2. A system of beliefs or morals answering the big questions of the universe. The god part and explanation part. Religion rooted in god. God and philosophy. Giving agency to thing we don’t understand as a way of explaining it like thunder or rain is key to religion. These started as ways to explain the world but as we dominated the world more and more religion of praying for rain became closer to a moral policeman. Things change and evolve. God of the gaps. Religion explains what we don’t know. The enlightenment took the idea that the ancestors were smarter and knew better which was a societal myth that people believed and turned it into the idea of progress through science. Changing peoples minds through action. They took the old books from antiquity and saw themselves as continuing the legacy. These old books were the best books on science despite being 2k years old. The people of the 16-17th century saw these people as their intellectual parents and wanted to continue their tradition. No progress made in the middle time. Static society. Alchemy was the precursor to science. Fantasy is a path to reality. Sometimes you need pseudoscience to drive real science and ask important questions. It was tough to tell who was right or wrong but the ideas of deduction were bad. If you can predict the tides from the moon why not a battle. If you can plant a seed and get food why not with gold. This shows the importance of curiosity leading to science but ultimately you need to have strong truth conditions because you need to believe you can do crazy things but they must be achieved in a structured way. Good predictions allowed us to create better science. We stand on the shoulder of giants. The end of physics was actually the beginning of it. Plancks teacher told him physics was solved and he helped reinvent physics
- The idea of humans using tools as technology isn’t new. We’ve always used different tools to dominate our environment. After the ice age ended the halocyn period started and humans were finally able to prosper and multiply because of weather and local knowledge like fire and hunting. The tech evolution was very gradual and gender differences were present between hunters and planters always. Settling down led to more innovation stability provided growth. Things evolved convergent like pottery. Invention of writing and bronze which is 90% copper 10% tin was an advancement in both knowledge and atoms. Then there was the first intellectual renaissance in Ancient Greece. Innovations of mind and matter. Bronze Age collapsed after it flourished and iron came into fashion. It took time to mold it right but once it was the people who used it were at such an advantage. The next 2 biggest inventions were the wheel and the horse domestication. In 1850 the biggest invention was the steam ship by 1950 it was the wheel. Lindy effect. The wheel wasn’t valuable for everyone like in South America where it was too steep for wheels or Egypt where they had the river. The Roman’s invented concrete and arches the had roads that slammed the empire and ships 2k years ahead of their time. Most of this information was lost to time not rediscovered for 2 millennia. Big innovations lost to time. Clocks were an innovation that were needed and used to help calculate latitude and longitude on the high seas. Clocks mace sailing less guess work but it was never easy. Innovation was passed across cultures as well carried by humans and adopted by other societies. Gunpowder was also a big evolution in technology not all was positive. Printing press revolutionized the spread of ideas. Democratizing knowledge breaking the church’s control over the narrative.
- We need to remain actively optimistic. We can’t just accept there are limits to knowledge and likewise only through breaking those limits can we prove they don’t exist. We can never prove the opposite statement. The more we know the more ignorant we are. It’s important to understand both what we know and how we know what we know. When we learn how to learn we also discover how people try to trick us into thinking we know but not actually knowing. Most people would rather die than think and most people do - Bertrand Russell. We’re ok being manipulated as long as life is ok. Debate is the motor that drives the wheel of progress.
- Bias and logical fallacies that cause ignorance. 1. The pinhole problem we have very limited data and perspective in our current space and time and are very biased by this we basically see the world through a pinhole from our point of view. 2. Metaphor problem what metaphors are we using how are they misleading. 3 map is not the territory. 4 criterial problem how do we enforce criteria like beauty and elegance how is that defined do these definitions help or bias inquiry. 5. Truth problem what is truth how certain does it need to be to be true. 95% confident 99% or 100% truth isn’t absolute. 6. Ptolemy problem theories have versimiltude and are right in some regards but wrong in others how do we accept that newton was both more right than the past and less right than the futures. 7. The man with a hammer problem you use your tools because you know how not because they’re best fit for the problem. 8. The lamp light problem when you lose your keys you look under the lamp light even though that is only 2% of the total area but it’s the easiest place to look. 9. The meddler problem when we investigate or observe something we can effect what is being observed observer effect. 10. Reading in problem. When we look at data we use assumptions local to the investigators which bias the view. 11. Pomenties problem the danger in reducing everything to one causal principle. Issue with reductionism. 12. Closure problem. The need to feel like you need an explanation or a final answer. The universe isn’t so generous and clean.

    - **Note:** These are all psychological biases that influence our observations. pinhole problem we see the world through a limited point of view this is the bias in our perspective. We reason by analogy but sometimes these are inaccurate. Map is not the territory. Bias inherent in models our definitions bias how we see the world. Truth vs certainty problem (probabilistic thinking). Verisimilitude of theories or Ptolemy problem. Man with a hammer you need the right models. Lamplight problem that biases search. Observer effect when we see things it effects the outcome. Reading in problem we use our biases around religion to look at societies 1k years ago which may bias us to think they are more like them we see what we can conceptualize. Reductionist problem we think there is one clear answer when the answer may be complexity. Closure we feel like there has to be an answer when this isnt always true.
- What do we know how do we know it are there limits to our knowledge. Do we have knowledge or just belief or opinion. If we accept knowledge is only something we can know as fact that can’t change we can only have knowledge in math even that is tough see goedl. We cannot truly know anything all our ideas could be wrong they are ultimately very well supported beliefs not that they’re not valuable or important but science starts and is rooted in doubt. We can advance and know more but it will always be fallible and we must respect that. Science and the scientific method deeply respect this and that has lead to the growth of knowledge in the modern world. The ability to find truth test ideas and maintain doubt.

    - **Note:** Because a lot of knowledge is subjective and fallible we need to know when we have knowledge versus just an opinion we need to constantly maintain out because truth isnt obvious. Respect Virsimilitude and the scientific method to increase truth, likelihood of knowledge.
- Paradox of knowledge the more we know the more aware of our ignorance we are. We didn’t understand in the past this point we think we were coming to the end of history not the beginning of infinity. We’re starting to understand that isn’t the case. We’ve always had frontiers of knowledge we’ve been traversing most of which have been wrong and why are the ones that we have now right given our history of being very and almost exclusively wrong about the frontiers paths and answers. What can we learn from the past to apply to the future. Practical knowledge is knowledge how like tools. Theoretical knowledge is knowledge why the how works. Original theoretical explanation started with abstracting what we think and believe and projecting it on animals. For example thunder was caused by anger. There was a higher power causing things. Everything had a soul deers ran because they were scared like us and processed emotions like us. We just thought everything was like us more than it was. This is what created a lot of early religion trying to come up with theories for the world. You think you have agency so you must create spirits or gods that also have agency and make other things move or exist in other things. Then we tried to control nature through prayer to what we thought was controlling it. Then when we understood nature better religion turned to morality to maintain social control of the situation. Religion and myth helped us control the world in our minds then turned to controlling humans. Knowledge how has always exceeded knowledge what in a specific time. We do more than we can explain. Thales was the first person to use knowledge and reason to explain the world not myth and despite being wrong he started the movement of science and philosophy. He may not have been the first but is the first recorded.

    - **Note:** Religion used to be our science. Our best explanation of thing then as science came to the fore religion lost its explanatory power over the world and started to exercise its moral power of humans it dominated the world only to dominate us. We have grown knowledge through explanations. We know how things happen like starting fires long before we knew what was actually happening to start fires. Practical vs religious knowledge and good explanations driving the world forward. We think we're at the end of history but our ignorance is always exceeded by future discoveries we're always at the beginning
