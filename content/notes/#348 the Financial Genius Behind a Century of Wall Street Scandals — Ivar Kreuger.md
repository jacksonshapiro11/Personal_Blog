- Ivar was a hero in his day, but when he died, uncovered, his company had many shell companies and ended up going bankrupt after his death. He was beloved in this time, but hated after death. He was very methodical. He came to America and when he was gonna go to a meeting or even a dinner, he would rehearse his lines for hours before like Joseph duvine. He ended up building a match monopoly makes a ton of money in real estate and starts branching out more. His match company is struggling but he creates a monopoly around it. He then goes to America to sell his match and construction company and they were legit businesses, but too much financial engineering and desire for more ended up, destroying them. Ivar had a deep understanding of human psychology he understood cycles in markets and use that to his advantage seeing that the US was in a cyclical boom road that wave promised 25% dividends and people loves. It also controlled the narrative which manipulate investment bankers and the investment bank that worked with him thought he was the best and ended up going broke. Understood how to control and manipulate people. Nothing is as appears with him he spread rumors about himself to make himself seem good. He wanted to meet this guy Durant so he spread stories that made him amazing so Durant would want to meet him. He plays it cool making himself seem scarce to cultivate desire but the whole time it was him who wanted the meeting. Like Enzo Ferrari telling people they couldn’t have cars to create desire.

Very high self confidence most of his companies were very legit. He is getting into construction and to win business he realigns incentives by promising to pay overages and overcharges in buildings which helped him win business unique contract negotiation. He offered to meet a fixed date which people paid more for he paid for every day he was late and got paid for every day he was early. He had the power to control timelines and align incentives.

- Incentives Drive Bankers' Actions
  Summary:
  The influential banker Rideback calmed down regulators regarding Evar's risky ventures because the banks were not just lending money to Evar but were also his biggest shareholders.
  By assisting Evar, the bankers were indirectly protecting their own interests, as they were benefiting from the fat dividends that Evar's company was providing. This situation exemplifies how incentives, such as lucrative dividends and shared stock ownership, can lead bankers to prioritize short-term gains over potential risks and regulatory concerns.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  But even then the regulators start talking to Evar's main banker in Sweden. This guy named is Rideback. Rideback is extremely influential. And so he's able to calm down the regulators. He says, listen, it's in our, it's our interest to survive. We don't need like costing new rules. We don't need extra regulation. And so this report that's put out about the dangers that's happening with a Swedish match company, it's, it's phrased as advice for regulators and not, it didn't require any action. And so you're like, I don't understand. Like why, why would the bank want to do that if their main customer is potentially taking risks that can make them lose money? And the answer is incentives. The banks were not only lending money to Evar, they were his biggest shareholders. So when the bankers help get the regulators off of Evar, they're in turn, getting the regulators off themselves. And why? Because they like those fat dividends that are coming in. And when you give people fat, effortless money, they don't question things. When Swedish match paid hefty dividends, much of that money went to the bank. Again, straight out of Rockefeller's playbook for different reasons. Rockefeller went around in the early days. He did something very similar in his early days of his career. The banks that he was borrowing money from to build the early days of standard oil, he also gave them stock and he gave them stock. So his competitors, right, his other oil refining competitors would code that same bank. ([Time 0:41:52](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6822a929-44f5-43fb-b43d-9f66edee0757))
    - **Note:** He was paying 25% dividends but not making 25% so he was borrowing money from American investors to pay Swedish early investors. He did this by creating a do nothing board and ofuscated financials, so it didn’t make sense and no one can understand it regulators were aware, but Swedish banks were making so much money they quieted the regulators they didn’t want the free money music to stop and if they kept growing maybe it wouldn’t have but the depression killed it. Needed continuous financing. He properly aligned incentives to get by with bad financials. He’s cooking his books sends fake financials and easily manipulate his auditor who didn’t know better. The more of the cash flow in the more people looked away. No one wanted to stop the party. Ivar always wanted control and even invented a class B share the maintain voting control was really just cooking the books and lying but people love free money.
- The Power of Incentives
  Summary:
  Negotiations were real as Ivar had regular meetings with government leaders.
  Burning was incentivized to believe Ivar to maintain his benefits like overtime pay, extra money, consulting fees, and trips. The passage emphasizes underestimating the power of incentives, prioritizing it above all else, and getting incentives right as the most important rule in management.
  Even individuals who grasp the importance of incentives may still underestimate their impact over time, as shown by the example of Federal Express in recognizing the power of incentives.

  Those negotiations were undeniably real. Ivar met regularly with government leaders. Given these facts, burning told himself, Geronta wasn't important. It couldn't be. In other words, burning is incentivized to believe Ivar because if he's not, if he's wrong, if he's lying, all the overtime, all the extra money. Oh, and I forgot Ivar is also paying him for consulting fees and paying him on the side and everything else paying for trips to his for his wife, all of that, the trips, the extra money that Prestige all of that goes away. And so at this point in the book where I think about one of my favorite passages from Port Charlie's Almanac, I'm going to pull up my highlights now, it really, the summary of what Charlie's About to tell us. Number one, we all underestimate the power of incentives. Number two, never ever think about anything else before the power of incentives. And number three, the most important rule in management, get the incentives, right? As usual, Charlie Munger described it in a beautiful way. Almost everyone thinks he fully recognizes how important incentives are in changing behavior, but this is not often so. I think I've been in the top 5% of my age cohort, almost all my adult life and understanding the power of incentives, yet have always underestimated that power. Never a year passes that I don't get some surprise that pushes a little further. My appreciation of incentive superpower. One of my favorite cases about the power of incentives is the federal is from a federal express. ([Time 0:58:38](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d5059a02-9afc-4043-af61-d1eb722c21f9))
    - **Note:** Incentive alignment is important. He paid for auditor to go on a trip to Europe while he was doing a deal so he wouldn’t see what was going on. It got to the point where his auto was asking questions and he would come up with stories and his auditor was making so many fees And did not want to ruin his relationship so he stopped asking questions. Master manipulator had real business milestones mixed with fraud. He hired people he could control. His auditor became partner. Ivar set up dinners where he said they were diplomats, but they were just fake actors. Align incentives fed ex pay people by shift not hourly. The only works if he keeps growing. He forged documents and made stamps with the signatures of diplomats to get signatures easily, but that’s really fraud. The depression leads to him unable to raise funds. He ends up killing himsekf because he knows he’s fucked and his investment bank goes broke because they were too greedy. He tricked and manipulated everyone but eventually the music stopped and he killled himself. Ur was his only option.
