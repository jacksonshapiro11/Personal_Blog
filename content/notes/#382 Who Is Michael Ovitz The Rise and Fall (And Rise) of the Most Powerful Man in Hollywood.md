  Podcasts recently. It's like overpay for talent because it's almost impossible to overpay for talent. And in this case, in 1973, Ovitz brings in $2 million for the firm and they pay him 400 bucks a week. And they're like, oh, you did a great job. Thanks for that 2 million. Here's a $7,500 bonus. So they're working way harder. They're making a ton of money for the old, you know, soft people and they're not getting compensated. So what do you think is going to happen? This is human nature. He's like, screw you guys. I'm going to do this on my own. So him and Ron are having dinner, and they're ([Time 0:29:59](https://share.snipd.com/snip/943eca61-5d73-4500-8dc2-0146126590be))
- He was relentless he started in tv shows because that was his only in. Then he would call a publisher every day for a year until he got a script.

He produced opportunities hiding in plain sight and took all opportunity. When a movie lawyer wanted to join they made him a partner. He learned everything he could about film so he could talk to directors in tune language of movies. He’s doing everything to win. He signs a director by selling a movie to a studio with him as the director. Then they sign the guy easy sell. Do the work to create a great experience. He is just conquering the industry.

  So one of the guys that he wanted to represent that was on his list of directors was a guy named Steve Gordon. So one way he would do, he says, we would poach people by assumption. We would behave as if we were the client's agent already and make their dreams happy, and then they would sign. And so he winds up getting a script, attaching Steve Gordon to the script, and selling it to United Artists as if Steve Gordon agreed to that. And then they ordered the movie with Steve attached to direct. And then Steve was very happy because the deal, think about it, you show up at his door, the deal's done.

- Ted Ashley advised a young Michael Ovitz to work 10% less, predicting it wouldn't significantly impact his success but would greatly increase his happiness. He didn’t take the advice but now believes it’s true to have a large work life balance and wouldn’t have effected his success. He comes to ask for more equity because he is doing more work but this creates a 16 year division that crushes his company. You can’t make people feel under appreciated even if you do more. He also realized his cofounder complained about his other cofounder behind his back to Michael not realizing he would do the same thing about Michael. He was also right place right time with an innovative model in the golden era of movies. Started to sell actors in packages first guy to do this. The studio needed a movie to produce he gave them all the actors. He didn’t beg for a job he presented a solution and the studios thought he was doing them a favor. It was all his clients so he made a killing in commission. He was never satisfied either. When he signed the biggest actor of his life he was already looking for the next one.

  In 1979, when I was 33, Ted Ashley at Warner Brothers took me aside and said, I'm going to give you some great advice. And knowing you, you're not going to take it. But here it is. I could have worked 10% less, and it wouldn't have made a difference in my professional success, but I would have been a lot happier. Ted was absolutely right on both accounts. It was great advice, and I didn't take it. I see now that I could have worked as much as 20% less and it wouldn't have cost me. If I worked even 10% less across 30 years, that's three extra, that's three extra whole years of life that I would have enjoyed. And so when I asked him about that, he's like, yeah, that's definitely still true. Now on his rise, he probably couldn't work 10% less because you see that was one of his edge. But within 10 years, when they have, you know, they're solidified, their momentum's kind of going, he could have easily worked 10% less.

- Michael Ovitz's daily routine included early workouts, hundreds of calls, and late-night screenplay reviews, leaving him exhausted. Hot up 545 to work out. Worked until late at night. His children often felt neglected, pleading with him to return to reality, highlighting the strain his work ethic placed on his family. Scorsese would watch old movies and ovitz said watching movies with him was a transformative experience working with a master. He just saw the world in a different way. Never miss time with kids. We’re always in a good old days. He was always paranoid when he was ceo. No matter what he does he prepares relentlessly by getting as much info as possible. Does intense deep research. He never constrains himself he does ads then does m+a. His partners get jealous of his success and don’t want the scope creep.

  And again, this is again, why autobiographies are so important. Yet treating my clients like family was hard on me and my actual family. I was waking up at 5.45 a.m. 15 minutes later, I'd be riding the bike in the gym and making calls to Europe, skimming five newspapers, marking articles for my assistants to strip out and distribute to the firm. After 40 minutes on the bike, I'd do 30 or 40 minutes of martial arts, working myself to exhaustion. By 8 a.m., after showering and eating a fast breakfast, I'd be on the car phone in route to the office. After our morning meeting, I'd take meetings, have lunch, a drink with a colleague, and a working dinner, all in between running calls, up to 300 phone calls a day. After being a chameleon all day at work, it took me an hour or so to figure out who the fuck I was when I got home. And all the time, the phone would keep ringing, which drove Judy crazy. She would want to discuss my day to feel closer to me, but I was exhausted by my day. And I didn't want to talk about work in front of the kids. I wanted them to feel normal and safe. After the kids went to sleep, I worked every night skimming through three or four VHS cassettes I'd brought home and chipping away at the stack of screenplays. Then I'd fall asleep to Johnny Carson at midnight and do it all over again the next day. My kids viewed my world less as something to aspire to than as something to lure me away from. They often noticed that though I was playing with them when they were young or asking about their days when they were older, that my attention was elsewhere. Could you please come back to reality, they'd say, or just earth to dad. I used the car as a place to return phone calls, viewing travel time as dead time. They, quite know, he's not alone with the same problem. I have it as well. You might as well. I do so, like, I find my mind wandering, right, back to work or whatever I'm thinking about when I'm playing especially with like my son because he's so he's still so small and the best Piece of advice I ever heard about this is when that happens ([Time 1:03:35](https://share.snipd.com/snip/532a7781-ab14-4e29-8fc2-126521dbfa26))

  And they wind up talking to the people at Coca-Cola. I was friendly, but unrelenting. And they finally sent me a new check for $31 million. And so he's drastically expanding, you know, what agents do. He's making way more money than anybody else, but he's also realizing, you know, he wants, he's draining them. He's just like pushing, burning himself to the last, uh, like burning the candle both ends. And he wants to build up equity. Like what happens when he stops working, you know, they like, he's making these big deals, but then the money just stops and he's, really just unbelievably tired. And I think this goes on for a while, but I think these few paragraphs is just great writing and gives you a sense of what was going on in his life and why he was eventually going to have to Make a change. And eventually, there's just no way he could stay at CAA forever. Aging was a young person's game and you could run just so long and so far. At 48 years old, having run since my first day at William Morris, I was tired. I was tired of getting up at 6 a.m. And squeezing in a workout while on the phone with Europe. I was tired of rolling through 300 calls a day. Talking till my throat was raw. I was tired of having lunches and dinners scheduled three months out. I was tired of flying 600 hours a year. I was tired of owning six tuxedos for the 30 obligatory events between November 1st and Christmas. I was tired of returning calls till 7 p.m., going to dinner till 10, coming home to a mountain of pink message slips, calling Japan till midnight, and starting all over six hours later. I was tired of submerging myself, drowning myself in the lives of my clients and their families and significant others. And And then on top of that, he says, I yearn to build equity. Once an agent stopped working, there was no more accrued equity to fall back on. Executives I considered as my peers, Michael Eisner, Barry Diller, were raking in hundreds of millions of dollars in stock options. I wanted to play in that league too. And in truth, I'd always been faintly embarrassed to be an agent. As much as CAA had professionalized our field, it would never be a noble calling. I wanted to be one of the six people who could say yes to a movie without scrounging to assemble all of the elements ahead of time. So he almost leaves CAA to run MCA Universal. And Ron, his best friend and partner, was kind of acting his agent through the whole process. They get to the end and Ovitz realizes that he's not too sure about the relationship with the owners and it's too big of a chance. So he decides to not take the job. And his friend and partner arrives at the exact opposite conclusion. So this is where they complete, this is a co-founder breakup where he breaks up with his co-founder. Says, Ron called me one day. Guess what? I met with Edgar and there's been a change in plans. He wants me to run MCA and I think I'm going to do it. I felt completely numb, with disbelief. The job on the table, chief operating officer, was one I'd negotiated for Ron in my last go-round with Edgar with one big difference. I was out of the picture. So they're going to bring in somebody. Ovitz was going to be the COO or CEO and Ron was going to be the COO. And then they decided to ditch Ovitz. And then they bring in this other guy named Frank as the COO that Ron's going to report to. After a long silence, when I felt I could speak without my voice breaking, I told Ron how much I needed him, what it meant to me to have him at my side. What came back in a burst of rage were all of Ron's pent-up grievances. Remember when Ovitz said earlier that he had set off this emotional time bomb. It just took 16 years to explode. This is what he was talking about. What came back in a burst of range were all of Ron's pent-up grievances. How I had made a big mistake by walking away from MCA. How it had always been all about me, never about him. How it was time to strike on his own, to be recognized as something more than my consigliere. I tried to sell him for two hours as the knot in my stomach swelled into my throat. Finally, my voice faltered and I gave way. His mind was made up. I felt absolutely crushed. Ron was leaving. It felt like I was getting divorced. So what he realizes is there's no way he's going to stay at CAA without Ron. His heart's not in any ways. He knows he's not going to stay there forever. They wind up selling CAA to the Young Turks, I think for like a token amount. I don't even know if they say the amount in the book. And the opportunity he left for was, okay, Ron was his first best friend. His second best friend was Michael Eisner. And Michael had been trying to recruit him to come to Disney and be his number two. And then Ovitz realizes he's just not meant to be a number two. But the reason I want to bring this up is because there was... ([Time 1:20:12](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8e992404-3dd5-4399-8a76-d05563d5d557))
