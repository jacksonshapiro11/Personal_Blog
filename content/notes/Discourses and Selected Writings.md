    - **Tags:** #lifelong-learning, #balanced-life, #education
    - **Note:** Unclear maybe focus and ethics vs not being widely read. Balanced/ wide education for perspective
- That he had absented himself from family life for so long shows that he regarded philosophy as a jealous mistress who demanded practically all his time and attention, which family life would not allow. ([Location 123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=123))
    - **Note:** Put philosophy over family

    - **Tags:** #life-path---presented-vs-discovered, #choose-your-life-and-feelings
    - **Note:** Yes this is it. We are responsible for our own lives.
- Indeed, the Stoics’ openness to revision was a particular strength of their school. ([Location 160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=160))

    - **Tags:** #internal-locus-of-control
    - **Note:** We control our minds only
- ‘Plato,’ he writes, ‘is only found in the hands of those reputed to be philologists. By contrast, Epictetus is admired by ordinary people who have the desire to be benefited and who perceive improvement from his writings’ ([Location 204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=204))
    - **Tags:** #customer-focused, #customer-(understanding-who-they-are), #simplicity-(power-of), #average-vs-tails, #writing-advice

    - **Tags:** #perception-vs-interpretation
    - **Note:** Perception vs interpretation
- irrational beliefs often appear in the way people talk to themselves. ([Location 255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=255))
    - **Tags:** #irrational-beliefs, #stories-we-tell-ourselves
- Music is no different; whether this is a good time to sing and play, or a bad one, the art of music by itself cannot decide. ([Location 278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=278))
    - **Tags:** #agency, #art
    - **Note:** Most arts are self contained resason trANscends we give agency to the world.
- Reason, in addition, takes the measure of music, grammar and the other arts, judging their benefit and deciding when it’s best to use them. ([Location 283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=283))
    - **Tags:** #practice-(importance-of), #reason
    - **Note:** Reason as executive function. Practice and improve your reasoning capabilities.
- And yet, while there is only the one thing we can care for and devote ourselves to, we choose instead to care about and attach ourselves to a score of others: to our bodies, to our property, to our family, friends and slaves. [15] And, being attached to many things, we are weighed down and dragged along with them. ([Location 293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=293))
    - **Tags:** #internal-locus-of-control, #favorite, #control-what-you-can-control
    - **Note:** There’s very few things you can genuinely control and external attachments weigh you down.
- Make the best use of what is in our power, and treat the rest in accordance with its nature. And what is its nature? However God decides. ([Location 298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=298))
    - **Tags:** #control-what-you-can-control, #inner-peace
    - **Note:** Most of life you cant control so just control what you can
- I must die. But must I die bawling? I must be put in chains – but moaning and groaning too? I must be exiled; but is there anything to keep me from going with a smile, calm and self-composed? ([Location 305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=305))
    - **Tags:** #perception-shapes-reality, #perception-vs-interpretation
    - **Note:** Personal choice perception vs interpretation don't need to react negatively
- ‘I have to die. If it is now, well then I die now; if later, then now I will take my lunch, since the hour for lunch has arrived – and dying I will tend to later.’ How? As someone who knows that you have to return what belongs to somebody else. ([Location 321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=321))
    - **Tags:** #choose-happiness, #death-(contemplate-it)
    - **Note:** Great quote. Contemplate and accept death then choose to live.
- Man, the rational animal, can put up with anything except what seems to him irrational; whatever is rational is tolerable. ([Location 324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=324))
    - **Tags:** #rationality, #irrational-beliefs, #favorite
    - **Note:** He who has a why can live with almost any how. Overlap with frankle
- In short, reflection will show that people are put off by nothing so much as what they think is unreasonable, and attracted to nothing more than what to them seems reasonable. [5] But standards of reasonableness and unreasonableness vary from one person to the next – just as we consider different things good or bad, harmful or beneficial. [6] Which is why education has no goal more important than bringing our preconception of what is reasonable and unreasonable in alignment with nature. [7] ([Location 328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=328))
    - **Tags:** #explanatory-knowledge, #why-(having-a-why-can-bear-any-how), #live-with-nature
    - **Note:** People are ok with thjbgs that are reasonable/make sense in their minds. being punched kn the face on the street vs ikn a cage usually starts with different priors and feelings. People accept things they can explain.
- ‘Shall I be a bathroom attendant or not?’ and I will tell you that earning a living is better than starving to death; so that if you measure your interests by these criteria, go ahead and do it. [11] ‘But it would be beneath my dignity.’ Well, that is an additional factor that you bring to the question, not me. You are the one who knows yourself – which is to say, you know how much you are worth in your own estimation, and therefore at what price you will sell yourself; because people sell themselves at different rates. ([Location 335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=335))
    - **Tags:** #know-your-worth, #selling-your-time
    - **Note:** Selling your life at different rates. Know your worth and what you sell your time for.
- Taking account of the value of externals, you see, comes at some cost to the value of one’s own character. ([Location 341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=341))
    - **Tags:** #internal-locus-of-control, #extermal-events
    - **Note:** Selling yourself. internals vs externals trade
- Because you think of yourself as no more than a single thread in the robe, whose duty it is to conform to the mass of people – just as a single white thread seemingly has no wish to clash with the remainder of the garment. [18] But I aspire to be the purple stripe, that is, the garment’s brilliant hem. However small a part it may be, it can still manage to make the garment as a whole attractive. Don’t tell me, then, ‘Be like the rest,’ because in that case I cannot be the purple stripe.3 ([Location 345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=345))
    - **Note:** Purple vs white stripe
- That’s what I mean by having consideration for one’s character. And it shows how weighty a factor it can be when it is allowed a regular role in one’s deliberations. ([Location 365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=365))
    - **Note:** Examine your character
- The possession of a particular talent is instinctively sensed by its owner; [31] so if any of you are so blessed you will be the first to know it. ([Location 370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=370))
    - **Tags:** #strengths-and-weaknesses-(relative-basis), #understanding-yourself
    - **Note:** Understand your strenghts and weaknesses
- Consider at what price you sell your integrity; but please, for God’s sake, don’t sell it cheap. ([Location 373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=373))
    - **Tags:** #favorite, #motivation-(diff-for-everyone), #trade-offs, #risk-and-return
    - **Note:** Living with character some thjngs dont make sense to one person that is obvious to another. Everyone places a different value on their character and at times death might be preferrable to degridation of character past a point. Pragmatic idea around valuing and making trade offs. Traders mindset on integrity
- Two elements are combined in our creation, the body, which we have in common with the beasts; and reason and good judgement, which we share with the gods. ([Location 383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=383))
    - **Tags:** #reason, #superpowers
    - **Note:** Basic vs enlightened our ability to reason is what separates us from everyone.
- For what else is a spiteful, malicious man except a fox, or something even lower and less dignified? ([Location 390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=390))
    - **Tags:** #quality-people, #spiteful
    - **Note:** Be hopeful not spiteful. Don’t be a dick you’ll be insufferable
- Make it your goal never to fail in your desires or experience things you would rather avoid; try never to err in impulse and repulsion; aim to be perfect also in the practice of attention and withholding judgement. ([Location 407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=407))
    - **Tags:** #avoid-negative-excess, #mindfulness, #4th-option-(mindful-awareness), #impluse, #do-what-needs-to-be-done
    - **Note:** Avoid negative things and keep your impulses in check experience the world without judgement. mindful awareness
- If you aim to be perfect when you are still anxious and apprehensive, how have you made progress? [13] So let’s see some evidence of it. But no, it’s as if I were to say to an athlete, ‘Show me your shoulders,’ and he responded with, ‘Have a look at my weights.’ ‘Get out of here with you and your gigantic weights!’ I’d say, ‘What I want to see isn’t the weights but how you’ve profited from using them.’ ([Location 408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=408))
    - **Tags:** #get-action, #men-of-action, #men-of-words, #good-life, #learning-is-behavior-change, #anxiety-(worse-than-the-event), #favorite, #progress-in-life
    - **Note:** The books or material you read doesnt matter it’s how you take action and improve your life based on those experiences. Be a man of action not a man of words. Show the fruits of your labor.
      Learning is behavior change
- ‘Take the treatise On Impulse and see how well I’ve read it.’ Idiot. It’s not that I’m after, I want to know how you put impulse and repulsion into practice, and desire and avoidance as well. I want to know how you apply and prepare yourself, and how you practise attention,∗ so that I can decide whether with you these functions operate in harmony with nature. ([Location 412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=412))
    - **Tags:** #men-of-action, #learn-by-doing, #men-of-words
    - **Note:** Put learning into practice. Learn by doing non-by reading.
- whoever desires or avoids things outside their control cannot be free or faithful, but has to shift and fluctuate right along with them, ([Location 421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=421))
    - **Tags:** #internal-locus-of-control
    - **Note:** If you base your life on external stimula you will always be a slave
- from the moment they get up in the morning they adhere to their ideals, eating and bathing like a person of integrity, putting their principles into practice in every situation they face – the way a runner does when he applies the principles of running, or a singer those of musicianship ([Location 423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=423))
    - **Note:** Great line
- For what else are tragedies but the ordeals of people who have come to value externals, tricked out in tragic verse? ([Location 432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=432))
    - **Tags:** #perception-vs-interpretation, #internal-locus-of-control, #tragedy
    - **Note:** Folly of external locus of control. Tragedies are perceived not actual problems
- It is easy to praise providence for everything that happens in the world provided you have both the ability to see individual events in the context of the whole and a sense of gratitude. ([Location 462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=462))
    - **Tags:** #graditude, #perspective-taking, #happiness, #favorite
    - **Note:** Graditude and perspective. You can see everything as holy and godlike when you see the bigger picture and smile. Every little event serves the person you are and will become
- And so for the beasts it is enough to eat, drink, sleep, breed and do whatever else it is that satisfies members of their kind. But for us who have been given the faculty of understanding, [15] this is not enough. Unless we act appropriately, methodically, and in line with our nature and constitution, we will fall short of our proper purpose. ([Location 481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=481))
    - **Tags:** #live-with-nature, #pleasure-seeking-vs-meaning
    - **Note:** Mans purpose we have a deeper understanding and must live with nature. We have more of a purpose than just to satisfy desires. We need to do something.
- But when there is no need even to travel, when you are already there∗ because Zeus is present everywhere in his works, don’t you want to look at and try to understand them? [25] Will you never come to a realization of who you are, what you have been born for and the purpose for which the gift of vision was made in our case? ([Location 492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=492))
    - **Tags:** #presence, #live-with-nature, #gods, #universe-listening-to
    - **Note:** You dont needd to go to a temple to see god because His miracles surround us everyday and instead of prayer we should live within nature abd appreciate the miracles in everyday life. Enjoy life through presence. Listen to the universe.
- You have been given fortitude, courage and patience. [29] Why should I worry about what happens if I am armed with the virtue of fortitude? ([Location 499](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=499))
    - **Tags:** #inner-strength, #inner-harmony
    - **Note:** You are inherently strong and can stand up to challanges
- What would have become of Hercules, do you think, if there had been no lion, hydra, stag or boar – and no savage criminals to rid the world of? [33] What would he have done in the absence of such challenges? Obviously he would have just rolled over in bed and gone back to sleep. So by snoring his life away in luxury and comfort he never would have developed into the mighty Hercules. ([Location 504](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=504))
    - **Tags:** #grow-through-hardship, #failure-(defined-by-response-to), #resume-(catalog-of-suffering), #favorite, #long/short-term-incentive-misalignment
    - **Note:** We are the summation of our challanges and accomplishments under stress. Our resume is the catalog of our suffering
- ‘In that case, perhaps he should have created them himself, by searching for a lion to bring into his land, and a boar and a hydra.’ [36] That would have been the act of a fool and a fanatic. ([Location 508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=508))
    - **Tags:** #control-what-you-can-control, #created-problems
    - **Note:** Dont intentionally put yourself through pain
- For what does reason purport to do? ‘Establish what is true, eliminate what is false and suspend judgement in doubtful cases.’ ([Location 526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=526))
    - **Tags:** #reason, #truth-seeking-(vs-being-right)
    - **Note:** Decifering arguments. Reason establishes truth and removes doubt.
- And so too in the case of reason, in addition to what we named, we also have to learn how to test and distinguish what is true, false and unclear. ‘Necessarily.’ [9] What else does reason prescribe? ‘To accept the consequence of what has been admitted to be correct.’ ([Location 531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=531))
    - **Tags:** #critical-approach-(conjectures-and-refutations), #test-assumptions, #reason
    - **Note:** Test theories aND accept outcomes. Critical approach
- Now, if the premises remain what they were when we granted them, then we are under every obligation to stand by what was granted and accept what follows. [18] But if they do not remain as they were, we don’t have to accept it,∗ [19] because the conclusion no longer holds for us. ([Location 545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=545))
    - **Tags:** #change-your-mind
    - **Note:** Changing your mind when the facts change.
- ‘So why aren’t we training ourselves and each other in this sort of argumentation?’ [5] Because at the moment, even though we aren’t being trained in these topics – aren’t, in fact, being distracted at all, so far as I have any say in the matter, from the business of improving our character – we still aren’t making progress toward the goal of virtue. [6] So what can we expect if we take on this additional project, especially since it won’t just distract us from weightier matters, but will be no small cause of pride and egotism? [7] Proof and persuasion are great talents, when they are trained, and especially when they’re complemented by a certain amount of verbal elegance. [8] In general every talent when it gets into the hands of the morally weak comes with the risk of making them conceited and full of themselves. [9] I mean, what’s to stop a promising young student from becoming a slave to – rather than a master of – these topics? [10] Won’t he brush these cautions aside and parade his learning in front of us, proud, elated and deaf to anyone who would forcefully remind him of the studies he has given up, and the areas where he stills falls short? ([Location 575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=575))
    - **Note:** When one devotes time to something he intentionally diverts time from everfy possible alternative. Focus and cultivate what matters the virtues and principals. do not waste time on nonsense and ancillsry things. Focus
- ‘But how am I supposed to eat, if I am destitute?’ someone says. Well, what about slaves, what about runaways – what do they depend on when they flee their masters? On their lands, their servants and their silver plate? Hardly; they rely on themselves, and still manage to survive. [9] So is our philosopher citizen-of-the-world going to rest his confidence in others wherever he lives or travels, rather than depend on himself? Is he going to be even lower and more servile than irrational wild beasts, all of whom are self-sufficient, provided with food and a mode of survival adapted to and in harmony with their nature? ([Location 604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=604))
    - **Tags:** #favorite, #self-reliance
    - **Note:** Be fully self reliant your body and everything external is not yours you only contrfol your thiughts and actions. Command those like a roman and a man
- For in fact it is silly and pointless to try to get from another person what one can get for oneself. ([Location 641](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=641))
    - **Tags:** #internal-locus-of-control
    - **Note:** Self reliance you can't rely on others for deeply personal things
- For men who are meek and cowardly, though, there is no option but to write letters for them as if they were already dead. ‘Please grant us the body of so-and-so together with his meagre ration of blood.’ [34] For, really, such a person amounts to no more than a carcass and a little blood. If he were anything more, he would realize that no one is ever unhappy because of someone else. ([Location 643](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=643))
    - **Tags:** #small-people, #death-(living-dead), #high-agency-people, #favorite, #internal-locus-of-control, #irony, #active-participant-in-your-life
    - **Note:** Men who are not self sufficient are already dead. Have agency and live your life. This is funny irony but also be an active participant in your life
- Is it the same thing to receive a petition that reads, ‘Please allow me to export a bit of grain,’ and ‘Please learn from Chrysippus how the universe is governed, and what place the rational creature has in it; find out, too, who you are, and what constitutes your good and your evil’? [11] Is one to be compared with the other? Do they deserve the same degree of application? [12] Is it equally wrong to neglect this one as that? Well, am I and the other teachers the only ones who are lazy and indifferent? ([Location 661](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=661))
    - **Tags:** #politics, #virtious-life
    - **Note:** Politics vs virtue. It’s as important to practice virtue as live and do your job.
- Likewise, I would be a lot more excited about joining you in serious study if I were once to see you bright-eyed and enthusiastic. ([Location 665](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=665))
    - **Tags:** #enthusiasm, #recruiting
    - **Note:** Enthusiasm recruiting others.
- In other words, it isn’t death, pain, exile or anything else you care to mention that accounts for the way we act, only our opinion about death, pain and the rest. [34] ‘Well, have I convinced you of this, or not?’ ‘You have,’ the man said. ‘As the cause is, so is the result. [35] Whenever we do something wrong, then, from now on we will not blame anything except the opinion on which it’s based; and we will try to root out wrong opinions with more determination than we remove tumours or infections from the body. [36] By the same token, we will acknowledge opinion as the source of our good behaviour too. ([Location 734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=734))
    - **Tags:** #opinion-(do-the-work), #opinions-of-others-=-poverty, #perception-vs-interpretation
    - **Note:** We dont act based on facts but on our biasedx perception and opinions of the world. If they are wrong and thry often are we need to adjust and improve them. Everyone has a different opinion about the world none is inherently wring and we must byt thought and examination into our opinions to live our best life
- we, not externals, are the masters of our judgements.’ ([Location 740](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=740))
    - **Tags:** #internal-locus-of-control
    - **Note:** Internal locus of control
- Freedom, you see, is having events go in accordance with our will, never contrary to it. ([Location 757](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=757))
    - **Tags:** #freedom, #accept-life-as-is
    - **Note:** Freedom is living with nature not contrary to it. Freedom is accepting the world as it is.
- Are you going to make Zeus your enemy, and set your face against the Fates, with whom Zeus spun the thread of your destiny at the moment you were born, laying out his plans for you? ([Location 783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=783))
    - **Tags:** #control-what-you-can-control, #grow-through-hardship, #free-will, #internal-locus-of-control
    - **Note:** The world doesnt care about you and is not out to get you. it exists and its your job to roll with it. I think here he is saying the external events are what they are and you can hate the world or just grow up and stand strong in the face of adversity control what you can control
- You should thank the gods for making you strong enough to survive what you cannot control, and only responsible for what you can. [33] The gods have released you from accountability for your parents, your siblings, your body, your possessions – for death and for life itself. [34] They made you responsible only for what is in your power – the proper use of impressions. [35] So why take on the burden of matters which you cannot answer for? You are only making unnecessary problems for yourself. ([Location 793](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=793))
    - **Tags:** #control-what-you-can-control, #mental-stability, #internal-locus-of-control, #extermal-events, #focus-on-what's-important, #agency, #favorite
    - **Note:** Survive what you can't control and take agency over what you can. Don't take on burden's you cannot control or bear this is a highway to failure, but take full agency over everything you can
- ‘If you have been placed in a position above others, are you automatically going to behave like a despot? Remember who you are and whom you govern – that they are kinsmen, brothers by nature, fellow descendants of Zeus.’ ([Location 803](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=803))
    - **Tags:** #equality-and-freedom, #asymmetric-power-dynamics, #love-for-others
    - **Note:** We are all gods cjildren and the same have compassion. Don’t exploit asymmetric power dynamics.
- That God supervises everyone ([Location 807](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=807))
    - **Note:** The ideas on god and science are so wrong but there is an abject beauty in this ignorance and the message is such that god need not be a person but an idea. The smargest people were so wrong about nature and yet so right about humans now we have the opposite issue great science advancement vs intense division
- ‘How else, after all, could things take place with such regularity, as if God were issuing orders? When he tells plants to bloom, they bloom, when he tells them to bear fruit, they bear fruit, when he tells them to ripen, they ripen.

- Since reason is what analyses and coordinates everything, it should not go itself unanalysed. Then what will it be analysed by? [2] Obviously by itself or something different.

If all this is true, then what grounds do we have for being angry with anyone? [3] We use labels like ‘thief’ and ‘robber’ in connection with them, but what do these words mean? They merely signify that people are confused about what is good and what is bad. So should we be angry with them, or should we pity them instead? [4] Show them where they go wrong and you will find that they’ll reform. But unless they see it, they are stuck with nothing better than their usual opinion as their practical guide. [5] ‘Well, shouldn’t we do away with thieves and degenerates?’ Try putting the question this way: [6] ‘Shouldn’t we rid ourselves of people deceived about what’s most important, people who are blind – not in their faculty of vision, their ability to distinguish white from black – but in the moral capacity to distinguish good from bad?’ [7] ([Location 931](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=931))

- Here you have philosophy’s starting point: we find that people cannot agree among themselves, and we go in search of the source of their disagreement. In time, we come to scorn and dismiss simple opinion, and look for a way to determine if an opinion is right or wrong. At last, we focus on finding a standard that we can invoke, just as the scale was invented to measure weights, and the carpenter’s rule devised to distinguish straight from crooked.

- if we don’t get the kinds of answer we expect, we throw up our hands and resort to ridicule or verbal abuse, saying, ‘He’s not a philosopher, it just isn’t possible to engage him in dialogue.’ [3] Well, when a guide meets up with someone who is lost, ordinarily his reaction is to direct him on the right path, not mock or malign him, then turn on his heel and walk away. [4] As for you, lead someone to the truth and you will find that he can follow.27 But as long as you don’t point it out to him, don’t make fun of him; be aware of what you need to work on instead.

- Show me one person who cares how they act, someone for whom success is less important than the manner in which it is achieved. While out walking, who gives any thought to the act of walking itself? Who pays attention to the process of planning, not just the outcome? [16] If the plan works, of course, a person is overjoyed and says, ‘How well we planned it! Didn’t I tell you, with brains like ours it couldn’t possibly fail?’ But a different result leaves the person devastated, incapable of even finding words to explain what happened. [17] No one ever consults a seer, or spends the night in a temple, out of concern for the means, rather than the ends, of their actions. Find me one such person, I want to see him.

Or used my senses and preconceptions unproductively? Did I ever blame you? Did I ever find fault with your administration? [9] I fell sick when you wanted it: so did others, but I did not complain. I became poor when you wanted, again without complaint. I did not hold office, because you did not want it; and never desired to hold office. Did you ever find me angry for that reason? Did you ever see me any way but with a smile on my face, ready to obey any orders that you had for me? [10] Now you want me to leave the fair, so I go, feeling nothing but gratitude for having been allowed to share with you in the celebration, to get to see your works and comprehend your rule.

[84] In that case you will never be free of fear or anxiety – or sorrow, which does you no credit either, seeing as fear for future evils turns to sorrow when they turn up. Nor should you feel irrational desire any more. You have a fixed and measured desire for the goods of the soul, since they are within your power and accessible.

- You should be especially careful when associating with one of your former friends or acquaintances not to sink to their level; otherwise you will lose yourself. [2] If you are troubled by the idea that ‘He’ll think I’m boring and won’t treat me the way he used to,’ remember that everything comes at a price. It isn’t possible to change your behaviour and still be the same person you were before. [3] So choose: either regain the love of your old friends by reverting to your former self or remain better than you once were and forfeit their affection. [4] And if you choose the latter, stick to it from here on out. Don’t give in to second thoughts, because no one who wavers will make progress. And if you are committed to making progress and ready to devote yourself to the effort, then give up everything else. [5] Otherwise your ambivalence will only ensure that you don’t make progress, and you won’t even get to revisit the pleasures of the past.

[11] Books? Yes, but how, or for what purpose? ‘Isn’t reading a kind of preparation for life?’ But life is composed of things other than books. It is as if an athlete, on entering the stadium, were to complain that he’s not outside exercising. [12] This was the goal of your exercise, of your weights, your practice ring and your training partners. You want them now that the time to exploit them has arrived? [13] Or it’s as if, in the matter of assent, when faced with impressions, instead of distinguishing which ones are convincing and which are not, we prefer to read a book entitled On Comprehensive Impressions.

- Impressions (which philosophers call), striking a person’s mind as soon as he perceives something within range of his senses, are not voluntary or subject to his will, they impose themselves on people’s attention almost with a will of their own. But the act of assent (which they call) which endorses these impressions is voluntary and a function of the human will. Consequently, when a frightening noise comes from heaven or in consequence of some accident, if an abrupt alarm threatens danger, or if anything else of the kind happens, the mind even of a wise man is inevitably shaken a little, blanches and recoils – not from any preconceived idea that something bad is about to happen, but because certain irrational reflexes forestall the action of the rational mind.

And if it spoils, it will turn into urine, vinegar or something even worse.” ’ There is absolutely nothing truer than these words, or more important; the greatest of philosophers thus implies that the writings and teachings of philosophy, when emptied into someone vicious and a fake – as into a foul and filthy vessel – become spoiled, degraded, and debased, turning into urine (as he says, in rather Cynic style) or, if it’s possible, something even more disgusting.

In any case, to object to providence on the grounds that the wicked go unpunished since they are rich and powerful is like saying that, if they lost their sight, they escaped punishment since they still had their fingernails intact.

    - **Note:** Bad things happen but you can conquer it with the right mindset.
- We are responsible for some things, while there are others for which we cannot be held responsible. The former include our judgement, our impulse, our desire, aversion and our mental faculties in general; the latter include the body, material possessions, our reputation, status – in a word, anything not in our power to control. [2] The former are naturally free, unconstrained and unimpeded, while the latter are frail, inferior, subject to restraint – and none of our affair. [3] Remember that if you mistake what is naturally inferior for what is sovereign and free, and what is not your business for your own, you’ll meet with disappointment, grief and worry and be at odds with God and man. But if you have the right idea about what really belongs to you and what does not, you will never be subject to force or hindrance, you will never blame or criticize anyone, and everything you do will be done willingly. You won’t have a single rival, no one to hurt you, because you will be proof against harm of any kind. [4] With rewards this substantial, be aware that a casual effort is not sufficient. Other ambitions will have to be sacrificed, altogether or at least for now. If you want these rewards at the same time that you are striving for power and riches, chances are you will not get to be rich and powerful while you aim for the other goal; and the rewards of freedom and happiness will elude you altogether. [5] So make a practice at once of saying to every strong impression: ‘An impression is all you are, not the source of the impression.’ Then test and assess it with your criteria, but one primarily: ask, ‘Is this something that is, or is not, in my control?’ And if it’s not one of the things that you control, be ready with the reaction, ‘Then it’s none of my concern.’ ([Location 3787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=3787))

- Whenever planning an action, mentally rehearse what the plan entails. If you are heading out to bathe, picture to yourself the typical scene at the bathhouse – people splashing, pushing, yelling and pinching your clothes.

- It is not events that disturb people, it is their judgements concerning them. Death, for example, is nothing frightening, otherwise it would have frightened Socrates. But the judgement that death is frightening – now, that is something to be afraid of. So when we are frustrated, angry or unhappy, never hold anyone except ourselves – that is, our judgements – accountable. An ignorant person is inclined to blame others for his own misfortune. To blame oneself is proof of progress. But the wise man never has to blame another or himself. ([Location 3819](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=3819))

    - **Note:** We give meaning to events good and bad they are just events until we give them agency. If we have issues we must look internally and ask why we need to hold ourselves accountable and split perception and interpretation. Judgements about events cause disturbance. Ultimately we see events agnosticslly no blame or good or bad just things. Transcend feelings of good and bad to just live. Don’t blame anyone not even yourself because there’s no blame and there is no misfortune

If you are insulted, you will discover patience. In time, you will grow to be confident that there is not a single impression that you will not have the moral means to tolerate.

- If you want to make progress, drop reflections like: ‘I will end up destitute if I don’t take better care of my affairs,’ or, ‘Unless I discipline my slave, he’ll wind up good for nothing.’ It is better to die of hunger free of grief and apprehension than to live affluent and uneasy. Better that your slave should be bad than that you should be unhappy. [2] For that reason, starting with things of little value – a bit of spilled oil, a little stolen wine – repeat to yourself: ‘For such a small price I buy tranquillity and peace of mind.’ But nothing is completely free. So when you call your slave, be prepared for the possibility that he might ignore you, or if he does answer, that he won’t do what he’s told. He is not worth entrusting with your peace of mind.

And if it has not reached you yet, don’t let your desire run ahead of you, be patient until your turn comes. Adopt a similar attitude with regard to children, wife, wealth and status, and in time, you will be entitled to dine with the gods. Go further and decline these goods even when they are on offer and you will have a share in the gods’ power as well as their company. That is how Diogenes, Heraclitus3 and philosophers like them came to be called, and considered, divine. ([Location 3862](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0NSS&location=3862))

If the essence of the good lies within us, then there is no place for jealousy or envy, and you will not care about being a general, a senator or a consul – only about being free. And the way to be free is to look down on externals. Chapter 20 Remember, it is not enough to be hit or insulted to be harmed, you must believe that you are being harmed. If someone succeeds in provoking you, realize that your mind is complicit in the provocation. Which is why it is essential that we not respond impulsively to impressions; take a moment before reacting, and you will find it is easier to maintain control.
