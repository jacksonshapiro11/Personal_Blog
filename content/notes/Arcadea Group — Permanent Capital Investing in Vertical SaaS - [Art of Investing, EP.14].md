- Non-Academic Pathways to Wall Street Success
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So anyway, they took college students to Wall Street, hedge funds are options, and it's worth taking a little bit of a riskier option because the payout might be there. And then once in there, I was reaffirmed that, oh, wow, this is pretty simple stuff, at least in terms of the language of business. Now being good at it is totally not simple. But being good enough to have a job is not hard if you're fortunate enough to get your foot in the door.
  Speaker 4
  Beyond these experiences, what other formational readings or influences did you guys have at that point?
  Speaker 1
  Before going there, I would say to just to double up on this failure theme. So I was at Citigroup. I did not get pushed forward to the associate class for behavioral issues. I got kicked out of work twice. Talking back, I was mess. I didn't know how to conduct myself. It was difficult time in my life. Somebody close to me had died, things like this, but that's no excuse. I just still had not at that point in my life figured out how to gain enough critical distance. The concept I was familiar with through the study of philosophy and religion. It could not figure out how to get enough critical distance from the completion between my emotions and thoughts. I knew that idea existed, but the bind was way too strong. Somebody told me about this one. I was four or five. I also hated the culture. It was not for me. I love the content, but I didn't see how we were making any difference in the world. I wasn't interested in the conspicuous consumption culture that was at least that predominated, not everyone, but many. I was unhappy with it. That was a failure because you're supposed to go to Ivy League school, you go to investment bank, you're supposed to get to the next level. I got unceremoniously rejected. That was a great thing that happened to me. During that period, he also touches on this element of keeping the windows open for the random injections of data points. I met this private equity guy at a DCM lunch at Capital Markets launch. He told me what he did at private equity. I was doing credit research. I thought, this sounds illegal. How often do you get the financials? He's like, any day I want, bro, I own the business. I said, well, gosh, I only get them quarterly. Can you talk to the CEO when you want? I mean, I was really ignorant. I really didn't know what private equity even was. He said, I own the seat. He works for me. She works for me. I can do anything I want. And I thought, gosh, it sounds so much easier than what we're doing. Maybe all, after this thing is over, maybe I'll go into that place because that sounds easy and interesting.

    - **Note:** Delusioned with the job and finding something different bring forced to. Critical distance from the completion between my emotions and thoughts. Critical distance allows a person to view a situation in a society critically without being biased or swayed in one direction or another. This is perception vs interpretation. He was delusioned but getting fired was the best thing that ever happened to him
- Keys to Sustainable Business Growth and Positioning vs Venture-Backed Companies
  Key takeaways:
  - Modern technology in vertical SaaS should be cloud native with high quality development languages and architectures suitable for ecosystem plays and AI.
  - Growth in vertical market software, with high sales and marketing efficiency ratios, is a sign of quality.
  - Deep founder insight and industry knowledge, leading to low attrition and high growth, is crucial in determining quality and success.

  Speaker 3
  Can you guys just don't click on how you define quality in the context of a company that you might be targeting?
  Speaker 1
  Sure. So first of all, modern technology that does not need major overholing. So it's cloud native. It has development languages that high quality development talent want to work in. And it has architectures that lend themselves well to ecosystem plays as well as AI, meaning that they have a really good fluid command over data and how to manipulate that data and clean That data, which ultimately is a currency of AI within vertical SaaS. So that's the first, the technological position of the business. Number two, very easy is just growth. And growth doesn't necessarily mean quality. If you're buying a dollar for a dollar 25, then that's not quality. But we look at absolute growth within vertical market software as one sign of quality, closely related to that is this is unit economics of sales and marketing. So almost all of our businesses have extremely high sales and marketing efficiency ratios. I eat very low tax. Sometimes the caps are close to zero because there are no formal sales and marketing functions in many these businesses. They're growing 30%, 40%, 25%, repeatedly without any sophistication. That's a really great sign that if you build a sophisticated sales and marketing motion, an engine, you're going to at least be able to extend that growth curve for many years, if not Accelerate and extend it. Lastly is deep founder insight and knowledge into the industry. And that is something that is manifested with low attrition, high growth, really high efficiency, at least in some parts of the business. But we still like to try to triangulate that and understand it away. We can write down, what is it that they know about the industry that a really smart person with money could not reproduce quickly?
  Speaker 4
  In this environment, right now, the venture bubbles been burst. There does seem to be more talk or vertical market software out there. At least it's more of a household term. How do you position yourselves versus the venture-backed companies? Maybe it's these machine learning based or vertical status where there's a lot of money put in to create the most modern tech stack possible versus some of the companies maybe you're Buying that have those attributes or maybe some don't. And they might have been around for 10, 15, 20 years and they never had any venture backing. ([Time 1:11:19](https://share.snipd.com/snip/38c1c14e-dfaa-4d7c-b9ee-7ea2cd4ae7d8))
