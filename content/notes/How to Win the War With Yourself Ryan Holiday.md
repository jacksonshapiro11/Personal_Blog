### Highlights

- Slow and Steady Wins the Race
  Summary:
  Embracing the principle of 'fastina lente' encourages a measured approach to progress, highlighting the pitfalls of pursuing shortcuts.
  Often, hasty methods lead to longer durations than a diligent, steady pace. The insights drawn from classic fables and proverbs reveal a timeless wisdom, showing that many contemporary ideas are not novel but rather rediscoveries of enduring truths.
  These principles, while seemingly simple, underscore the ingenuity of past thinkers who articulated them, affirming that wisdom transcends time and is not inherently ingrained in human nature.

  Speaker 1
  Yeah, there's a Latin expression called fastina lente, which just means to make haste slowly. We often look for shortcuts, and it takes longer than if we just sort of done it slow and steady. It is amazing at some level how it all can be reduced down to something in Aesop's Fables or a cliche or a little proverb. I've been amazed lately at the idea that somebody said that for the first time. Someone will invent a new word to express a concept or someone will invent a new way of thinking about things. We'll go, oh, that's great. But a lot of these things that we take for granted, like, it's not like they're hardwired into our DNA. And so somebody who's now lost came up with that idea, the timelessness of the truth of that. I just, I just love. And that it's been true for 2,300 years or whatever.

    - **Note:** When are you going to start listening to what the universe is telling you. When you get too drunk at the office Christmas party or when you have to sell your house. We don’t control what happens we just control our response. Don’t pontificate on how you got into a situation accept and embrace the situation then take action. Pontificate later. Reflect through journaling after the dust has settled. It’s not the things you say that upset you but your opinion about those things. The stories we tell ourselves upset us more than anything. Stocism is accepting and playing the hand you’re dealt. It’s hardest to walk away on top. Be confident enough to demand what you’re worth. When you have a void inside you it’s much tougher to demand what you deserve and you end up giving in to a lot of bullshit you shouldn’t. Value yourself. The biggest thing is not what others ask of you your North Star should be what you ask of yourself
- Virtue is Action, Not Possession
  Summary:
  Philosophy often complicates moral questions to the point of distraction, focusing on edge cases rather than the everyday decisions that shape our character.
  Instead of viewing virtue as a possession, it should be seen as an active practice—much like developing a skill through consistent action. Goodness arises from a series of small, daily choices rather than rare, significant decisions.
  One's character can be tested through scandals and public scrutiny, yet true character endures beyond external criticism.
  A focus on continuous, generous actions builds integrity over time, demonstrating that even amid failure, positive impact can prevail.
  Virtue signaling may not always stem from genuine character, but it at least acknowledges the importance of virtue, contrasting sharply with the nihilism of moral apathy. Upholding high standards in daily life allows for personal growth and reinforces the discipline of justice, ultimately resulting in a more ethical society.

  Speaker 1
  One of the things I don't like about philosophy is the way that it looks at these moral questions and it makes them so complicated as to make them almost worthless. Like, how do you know what's right and wrong? What about this? It's like we almost focus on the edge cases as a way of there's such a middle ground that we can all agree yeah that's like 95 you know we're like should you know a nazi's banging on your door They want to know if you have a jew in your basement should you lie to them or should you tell the truth because you know like this is a cons categorical imperative you know a trolley is racing Down a track and it's going to kill five people. But if you pull this lever, it'll go here and kill one person. What would you do? It's a way of abstracting away from the fact that we have morally charged decisions in front of us all the time, and we don't think about it and don't do anything about it. And that middle ground, if everyone just did a little bit better on this middle ground, the whole world would be immensely better.
  Speaker 2
  We've all sort of had moments where we didn't act to the person. We didn't choose the action to the person that we're capable of being. How do you live up to the best version of yourself?
  Speaker 1
  We think of virtue as this thing that you have or don't have. Think of it as a noun. It'd be far better to think of virtue as a verb. Aristotle says, how do you get better at playing the flute? It's by playing the flute. How do you become a more generous person? It's by doing more generous actions. He sort of compares virtue to any other craft that, you know, a carpenter builds stuff, and that's how they become a carpenter. So a good person does good things, not the way we sometimes think about it, which is like, go through your regular life. And then perhaps you will find yourself in some decision of enormous moral consequence upon which the fate of the world will depend. And then let's hope that you draw from this ethical framework that you read about in a book and will make everyone proud. But in fact, it's like a series of small daily decisions, just like any other discipline. And that's why these virtues are so related. Like there's a discipline to justice. I keep my word. I help people. I think about the consequences of my actions on other people. I don't do insert X, Y, or Z thing that might be legal, but not right. And so if you think about it as a practice, you can get yourself, not only can you get yourself to a place where you're capable of doing it, but by nature of doing the practice, it's never Going to happen that we're just going to pick some random ass person and put the fate of the world on their shoulders you have to be involved in the thick of things making decisions of consequence
  Speaker 2
  To ever find yourself in a position of decisions of consequence we live in a world where your slip up in character which we all make yes can now become viral on the internet it's like you Yelled at somebody you weren't generous when you could have been generous you did something stupid somebody had their phone out and now you can't recover from this you know the profumo
  Speaker 1
  Scandal in uh london in the 60s there this cabinet officer in the British government who has this affair. So he's cheating on his wife. He's cheating on his wife with a prostitute that turns out to be a Russian spy. And then he lies about it. And it ends up bringing about the fall of, I forget which government, but it brings about the prime minister vouches for him and then has to apologize and ends up resigning as a result. And I tell the story of Perfou because I think he's so interesting. So he destroys his political career. And today we would say he was canceled and what would happen today is that this person would be basically shunned by one half of society and then perversely like embraced by another darker Side of society that doesn't like those people right and you would see him get radicalized and fight against cancel culture you know you we almost know exactly how that scandal would Go. He would like get rid of all of his political beliefs from before, embrace a different set of political beliefs, and kind of become almost like these Joker-like figures. And instead, he just quietly shows up one day at this charity. I'm forgetting the name of it. It was like a Salvation Army style charity house. And he shows up one day and asks if they need any help. And they put him to work in the kitchen, like he's washing dishes. And he volunteers there every day for like the next 40 years. And he becomes its chief fundraiser its main leader and he just quietly goes about his life doing good work and eventually there is an arc of redemption to it that you can't do good every Day for decades without it inevitably being noticed did he get his political career back no did everyone forgive him no is his name still inextricably linked with a certain scandal? Sure. But on net, most people look back and go, probably overreacted. We certainly made judgments about this person based on a singular set of decisions that his subsequent revealed to be more complicated. An aberration of sort of character. Exactly. And I think, to me, that's the danger in today's world. It's not so much that you'll make a mistake and people will judge and criticize you for it. Because I think that's always been true. You're right. The internet is not a place where grace is commonplace and uh where things can be wretched out of context and all of that and yet actual danger is that in all of that scandal and attention And negativity does it change who you are like i am fascinated by people who are fascinated by and impressed by the people who have messed up, had scandals, been the subjects of cancel Culture or mobs or whatever. And then they emerged from it not caricatures of themselves, that it actually wasn't this life-defining, formative change. Like the Stoics talk about, ([Time 1:07:29](https://share.snipd.com/snip/bd1c7d30-5cb3-42ef-9451-d5c74ade2036))
    - **Note:** Virtue isn’t a noun it’s a verb. You become virtuous by practicing virtue constantly. Don’t let people change who you are. Do good when no one watches.
- Choose Your Objectives Wisely
  Summary:
  Success is often defined in relative terms, influenced by comparisons with others.
  A decade ago, success may have revolved around specific achievements and societal standards; however, the focus can shift towards personal values and absolute benchmarks. Comparing oneself to those at different levels may provide temporary satisfaction, yet it can hinder true potential and fulfillment.
  One can redefine success by recognizing individual circumstances and appreciating their own achievements, even modest ones.
  It is essential to understand the trade-offs involved in pursuing different goals, as opting for one path means giving up others.
  Aspirations exist within unique contexts, and every decision carries inherent limitations. Emphasizing personal growth over relative success fosters a more meaningful and satisfying journey.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  How do you define success today and how has it changed? Do you remember what I said the other times? No. I still think my definition of success is autonomy. Like I've been saying recently, like success is how much you see your kids and power is how much control you have over your schedule. My son's school called and he was sick and I was like, all right, I'll be right there you know I like that to me that's that's both success and power I didn't have to ask anyone's permission I didn't need to worry about the cost of yeah missing a day's work or whatever I just could handle it turns out it wasn't actually sick you know he's just had a cough or something and so we Just hung out all day And then I had a talk that afternoon and he came with me.
  Speaker 2
  How has that changed from like a decade ago when you would define success when you were younger?
  Speaker 1
  I think success was often more predicated on like either very specific things or relative to other people and their accomplishments. And I think I've gotten closer and closer to just not really caring.
  Speaker 2
  And part of that is living where I live, how my life is set up, just valuing different things. The relative thing is fascinating because if you compare yourself to people who are relatively not pursuing the same goals, maybe not as successful as you are, you sort of feel good About yourself, but maybe you're not reaching your potential because you can sort of coast a little bit. And if you compare yourself to people who are better or more successful, then you're perpetually sort of like not where you want to be. And it can sort of like destroy your satisfaction.
  Speaker 1
  I try to remind myself that I write about an obscure school of ancient philosophy, that there's a floor and a ceiling to that look if we compare ourselves to james clear we're all failures Yeah and far as book sales but if you compare yourself to the millions of people who would kill to even have a meeting with an editor it's a huge success sometimes it can be helpful to really Think about how bodice you would have previously defined success.
  Speaker 2
  Oh, totally. And then there's also like a relative or sort of like a relative success and absolute success, which is, you know, if you sell, I think, I don't know what the actual number, I heard it was Like 50,000 books. Yeah. You're in the top 1% of books ever published in the history of humanity. So like, there's always a different way to change your perspective on where you're at and sort of, and what a friend of mine used to say this, like, if we threw everybody's shoes in a big Pile and you picked out the shoes and you got all the problems with it, you'd probably pick your own shoes. Like the whole world, basically, you know, you could pick anybody's problem.
  Speaker 1
  You're most of the time you're going to pick yours. There's a lot of people who would try to pick our problems. When I feel jealousy, I try to remind myself that you can't pick and choose. Like if you want what someone has, you have to trade your whole life. And in that case, you almost would never take it. Or maybe not even your whole life. But let's just say like, oh, why did they get this opportunity? I should have got this. But it's, no, no, you have to swap your whole career for theirs. Would you do it. And it becomes more complicated. It's, we want, you know, we want to be a little from here, a little from here, a little from here. But that's not a possible combination because every decision, every goal inherently is making things not goals. There's trade-offs. Yeah. Yeah you can't be like i want to be classical musician and then compare yourself to taylor swift they're just they're different genres of music that have different floors and ceilings So like you know it might be easier to break out as a classical musician i'm not saying it's easy but like you know there's a there's a set audience and there's also a ceiling you're never Going to be the number one album in the country but by going for the number one album in the country you might get nothing and just understanding that you made certain choices and that You can't. Strategy is by definition, choosing certain objectives and not choosing other objectives. ([Time 1:37:02](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fb504212-581c-4bd1-96ec-6cd8724fcb78))
    - **Note:** Definition of success as autonomy. Internal success.
