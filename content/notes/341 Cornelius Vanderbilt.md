- Strategic Business Ventures' Impact on Historical Events
  Summary:
  The key insights reveal how a strategic business venture involving securing contracts with the US government and negotiating exclusive rights with the Nicaraguan government to build canals across Nicaragua set the stage for historical events.
  By obtaining contracts worth millions annually and planning to construct canals through Nicaragua before the Panama Canal was built, the groundwork for the book's narrative is established. The clash between Cornelius and William Walker, driven by their contrasting upbringings, is at the core of the story, shedding light on Walker's motivation to become a doctor due to his mother's illness and his extensive self-education.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I want the contracts, which would be the equivalent of a couple hundred million dollars a year in guaranteed income from the US government today. And then the second thing I want is I want you to negotiate with the Nicaraguan government. This is before William Walker overthrows that government, right? And I want the exclusive rights from the Nicaraguan government to build canals across Nicaragua at the beginning. So now we live in a world where they did this across Panama, right? At the time before the Panama Canal, the idea was to and he actually gets this contract, right? So that he's actually successful in this meeting with the secretary of state. At the time, they thought they were going to build the canal across Nicaragua. If you look at a map of Nicaragua, you'll see this giant lake in the middle, it's called Lake Nicaragua. So the idea was cut a canal through there on one side. So that would be the east side and then a smaller canal on the west side and I would dump you into the Pacific Ocean. So that plan, this new business that Cornelius is building sets up the entire story, which is what this book is about, which is this war that he has with William Walker. So I need to give you a little background on William Walker and why I said he's essentially the exact opposite upbringing. So his mom is excessively sick when he's young and they can't figure out the local physicians are unable to diagnose her condition. So he had this intense devotion to his mother and so he's like, I'm going to become a doctor and cure my mother's mystery illness. So he starts reading every single book he can possibly find.

    - **Note:** Vanderbilt grew to house one and every $20 in existence of wealth when he died, he rode the wave of different technologies during the gold rush. He saw people traveling cross country for $600. Realize he could do it for 300 he ways concealed real intentions he went to meet with the Secretary of State to inform him of his plan to cut across Nicaragua which was fatter and cheaper to get permission to build a canal and move the us mail through the route too brining in millions to him. Vanderbilt had no formal schooling was a genius rejected normal education learned in the job. William Walker is a genius graduated college at 14 graduates to medical school and knows 5 languages by 18 becomes a doctor to save his moms life she dies becomes a newspaper editor. Then he became a philabuster which was a man who invaided other countries to spread manifest destiny. Daniel Ludwig see from the front don’t trust specialists who tell you their thoughts.
- Self-initiative leads to success and profit

  Speaker 1
  Not for the first time in his life or the last Vanderbilt had said that something could be done and then gone out and proven it. In the process, he opened up the way to California, a path that would soon be followed by tens of thousands of his countrymen. So Daniel Ludwig, like Cornelius Vanderbilt before him proves that sometimes you have to do it yourself. So he starts this business is phenomenally successful. This Nicaraguan transit business, it's the company is going to be called the accessory transit company. In the first 12 months of operation, it carried 2000 passengers. Oh, and I forgot to mention this another way he makes money in addition to the mail contracts. They're they're running gold, right? If you're discovering gold in the west coast, you got to get to the east coast, which is the finance center. So he's carrying 2000 passengers first year and billions of dollars worth of gold as paying freight in the first 12 months, it delivered Vanderbilt personal profit of tens of millions Of dollars in today's equivalent, tens of millions of dollars. So he has a deal where he pays like a flat upfront payment to the Nicaraguan government. And this is, Hey, you can make 10% of the profit. Now, here's the problem. And this is what when William Walker is a president, he's going to cancel this contract because it says the the Nicaraguan government had not seen a single penny from the profit. They're supposed to get 10%. And why? ([Time 0:20:24](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1148e76c-3085-4ee1-8697-d9933e897e7b))
    - **Note:** Vanderbilt told that the Nicaragua pass cannot work but he goes and sees from the front like Daniel Ludwig and pilots the steam ship himself across the river when no one else could’ve been working with steam ships since 11/50 years and he proved the ability to get it across the river This becomes a very profitable track for him transporting golden people across the US. They literally told him it couldn’t be done and he sailed down there himself and did it to prove it to them to show them they were wrong he says he’ll cut in the Nicaragua government, some of the profits, but then budget, counting to say there are no profits, then Walker when he takes control over the government is going to come after Vanderbilt for the phone, accounting and real money. Vanderbilt is absolutely ruthless he sends mercenary to kill Walker he should’ve feared Vanderbilt more than he did he was always working on a cut for himself. He had a 20% take on a company he owned he sent his wife to an insane asylum for 3 months until she agreed to move from Staten Island to nyc. He goes on vacation for the first time ever and almost loses his company through a coup. Vanderbilt then starts his own company and charges half the previous price just to drive people out of business. Vanderbilt was kicked of the company but using legal hurdles and hidden purchases reacquired the company leaving the people who kicked him out bankrupt he didn’t want to beat people he wanted to crush them.
- Strategic Diplomacy and Alliances
  Summary:
  Vanderbilt strategically leveraged diplomatic channels and alliances to address a situation where his assets were seized by the Nicaraguan government.
  He initially sought redress from the Secretary of State and the British ambassador, successfully securing the British Navy's support. He further expanded his alliances by engaging with several Central American states and Colombia to advance his interests and protect his assets in the face of complex political dynamics.

  So he says Vanderbilt knew that after 18 months of civil war, the Nicaraguan government was as good as bankrupt and could not afford to buy as much as a robo. And so his first method of attack, he goes to the Secretary of State and he says he just runs into his office. This is right after he finds that the Nicaraguan government had canceled charters took all of his assets. And he says he exploded with rage and indignation and demanded redress by the US government. He wants the US government to use their military to get his assets back. The very next day, he does the same thing to the British ambassador in Washington, D.C. Because at this time in history, the British empire is down there, Americans are down there, Mexicans are down there. There's an ongoing like war between five other Central American countries. Like there's all kinds of different parties at stake here. And so the British agreed to help Vanderbilt because Vanderbilt was already aware that Walker was a thorn in the side of the British government because he had been trying to occupy Greytown, Which was under British control or rule at this time. And so the British ambassador agrees to permanently station a warship at Greytown and tells Vanderbilt that he could ask for the assistance of the commander of that ship. So starts with the Secretary of State of America, then goes to the ambassador of Britain. Then he goes and meets immediately with the ambassadors of the Central American States of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. And the ambassador of Colombia.

    - **Note:** Vanderbilt is having trouble in Honduras with people taking a shit so pretty much goes to the secretary of state of the US Britain Honduras, every major country to get everyone on his side. Vanderbilt is turning everyone against Walker by appealing their interests he says it’s dangerous to the us citizens as well as the other countries like Colombia because he’s coming to take that next. Walker took Vanderbilt’s stuff and so Vanderbilt had to crush him. Walker didn’t understand Vanderbilt he thought he could take his stuff and Vanderbilt wouldn’t do anything he would be protected by the law because Walker was the president. Walker definitely didn’t think Vanderbilt will try to kill because he didn’t understand human nature and his opponent. He had to understand the man not the law. Vanderbilt built his empire on his fists he was never gonna back down Walker had no clue he put a 50k bounty on his head. Walker is still following the rules when he’s at war but in war there are no rules just the law of nature. Vanderbilt got rich off steamships but his generational wealth was made by pivoting to railroads.
