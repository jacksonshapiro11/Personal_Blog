### Highlights

- **Reverse Charisma**
  * True charisma isn't about being interesting, but about making others feel interesting.
  * Focus on making people feel comfortable and engaged by being curious, patient, and encouraging.
  * This "reverse charisma" creates a safe space for others to share their own stories and vulnerabilities.
  * It's about how much of another person you can tolerate, and how much they feel seen and understood by you.
  * Embrace your own strangeness to help others feel at home with theirs.
  * Have reverse charisma make others feel special. Make others seem interesting.

  So Jenny Jerome, who is Winston Churchill's mother, who was Winston Churchill's mother, dined with both Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli and his rival, William Gladstone, on consecutive Nights back to back. And she got asked about her impressions of the two different men. She said, when I left the dining room after sitting next to Gladstone, I thought that he was the cleverest man in England. But when I sat next to Disraeli, I left feeling like I was the cleverest woman. And I think most people assume that they want to be charismatic. They want their energy to be compelling and their stories to be electric. They want to walk into a room and everybody be impressed, magnetized to them. But when I started to think about the friends I love and want to spend the most time with, they didn't necessarily have charisma. They had reverse charisma. Certain people make us feel boring, but others don't? Why is it that we feel full of stories and inspiration around some people, but around others, we've got nothing to say? And we try to assess other people based on how interesting they are. And because of that, we miss a much more important issue, which is how interesting they make us feel. Like, how engaged is this person? And how much of us can they tolerate? And how much of our reality can they handle without us having to edit ourselves? How encouraging and reassuring are they? And how much do they make us want to dig deeper and talk more? And how comfortably can we sit in silence without needing to fill it?
  Speaker 2
  Basically, how much of us do they get? And if it's not a lot, then we're inevitably going to be cautious.
  Chris Williamson
  And a person feels interesting precisely to the extent that they have become familiar and at ease with the things that are extreme and sad and dark and agonizing and shameful and joyous And exciting. And if they are at home with their own strangeness, then they help us to feel at home with ours. Where they have gone, we can follow. What they have felt safe exploring in themselves, we will be able to safely unpack around them. And this was the sort of realization that architecting your charisma is a nebulous and scrappy task that autistic pickup artists gave themselves existential crises failing at. But building reverse charisma is something that anyone can do by being curious and patient and encouraging. ([TimeÂ 0:08:01](https://share.snipd.com/snip/57c67f14-b5fa-4ffa-bac3-07e166b57814))
- **Balancing Public Image and Private Growth**
  * Be mindful of the gap between your public persona and private beliefs.
  * Social consistency can hinder personal growth, making it difficult to evolve publicly.
  * Public pronouncements create expectations that can be hard to deviate from.
  * Changing your mind publicly can draw criticism, especially from those who mistake unwavering views for intelligence. People hate when you change your mind
  * Keep yourself internally and externally consistent. We must be careful about what we pretend to be because we become that. 
  * Consider keeping some aspects of your life private to avoid external pressures and maintain authenticity.

  Chris Williamson
  So I told this story a couple of times about a retreat I went to in California, but then I saw a Kurt Vonnegut quote that sort of perfectly summarized it, zipped it down, and it's easy to Remember. So Kurt says, we are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be. We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be. So I'd gone to this retreat in California and I met a business owner who had a big YouTube channel that I used to watch a lot a long time ago. And then I asked him why he'd stopped making videos. And he said, I started feeling like I had to live up to in private the things which I was saying in public. And I think about this quite a lot. I've come to sort of realize there's two sides to fake it until you make it. And one is positing an ideal or a better version of yourself, which you're motivated to live up to due to the need for social consistency. But that stake in the ground acts as much like a tether as it does a finish line. If you commit yourself to some worldview or life philosophy, what happens if you stop agreeing with it? Sure, you might want everyone, you might want to change, but everybody around you has grown accustomed to the previous version of you. And whether it's lifestyle changes like your dietary approach or your training methodology or worldview changes like a religious belief or political affiliation or personality Changes like commitments to growth or going sober or changing friend groups, social consistency bias is a double-edged sword. A while ago, some of the leading influences of the ex-paleo diet movement, then the carnivore movement, started to add fruit into their food. And the aptly called meat and fruit diet caused uproar, not because of evidence that the diet is based on, but because its new proponents had ardently stated a different belief in the Past, and the change caused the people around them to feel uncomfortable. This is the danger. The social incentives align for you to not change in public, even if you grow out of your beliefs in private. Stupid people see someone changing their mind as an indication of unsophistication because they don't understand that updating your worldview when you grow is sign of intelligence, Not fickleness, and that an unwavering commitment to a narrow worldview is not cleverness, but a substitute for it, which unfortunately means that after changing your mind in public, It often results in you being attacked by a large number of mostly stupid people. And the more public you are about it, the harder it is to reverse. Perfect example of this. Alex O'Connor goes vegan, is convinced about the ethics, the philosophical underpinnings of veganism, does not want to contribute to animal suffering. But as a byproduct of that, his health suffers and he is struggling to keep his health to where it needs to be whilst eating a balanced plant-based diet. It's not something he says that he doesn't think you can do, but something that given his level of conscientiousness and preparedness, it was something he was struggling to do. So his demeanor was incompatible with the challenges that his new diet, informed by his new philosophy, had given to him. So he went back to eating meat. He had to announce in public something which he had changed in private. And he got fucking castigated on the internet for it for ages. I mean, he's now out the other side. I don't think anyone really brings it up anymore. But that was uncomfortable to watch, especially when you think this guy's doing it for his health. And he said it, he told you, he made this change and, and he told you about it. He didn't lie.
  Speaker 2
  He didn't continue to get those sweet vegan dollars if they ever existed. Uh, He never did that. He told you as soon as you changed and people still had a problem with it.
  Chris Williamson
  So be careful of the things that you say in private, uh, not being able to be compatible with the expectations people have of you in public. And, um, yeah, that stake in the ground versus finish line. Am I positing an ideal or am I attaching my self-worth to an expectation that I'm then going to have to rip off me? I'm going to have to sort of peel this fucking skin off me that everybody else expects. It's difficult. Personal growth is hard enough as it is without all of the expectations. It's why, you know, to be honest, what are we, 45 minutes in? I can talk about this now. The reason why I don't talk about, like deeply talk about my relationships on the show, you know, even though I talk about relationships and dating, uh, and a lot of the dynamics, it's Evidently something I'm interested in. I'm obviously, you know, on the path toward trying to build a family and do all the rest of this stuff. But I think it's fucking so hard to have a relationship full stop having a relationship with even a couple of thousand people observing it. You remember what it was like when you used to get the, Chris Williamson is in a relationship notifications on Facebook or whatever. You would see it from your friends and people would be able to like it and comment on it. And then it would tag the other person. But then it would also show Chris Williamson is single. Fuck, like you've only got what, I think a thousand friends or something on Facebook. That was a huge deal. I mean, I don't know, maybe I'm speaking, depends how young you are. You might not have ever seen that on Facebook. That was fucking revolutionary, by the way, bring back Facebook dating shit. But that was hard. Just doing that was hard. So how hard is it when you're posting photos of you both? And that's the reason why I've kept that area of my private life private, because again, you've got this expectation, the stake in the ground, additional scrutiny. Do you stay in relationships for longer than you should because you're scared about what people are going to think? Do you leave relationships more quickly than you should because you're scared about what people are going to think? You're never existing for yourself.
  Speaker 2
  You're always existing for this version of what people who don't necessarily have your best interests at heart think about how you should behave. ([TimeÂ 0:41:15](https://share.snipd.com/snip/17c13c9c-4069-419e-8c67-42c53715e2f7))
- **True Happiness**
  * People sacrifice self-worth for validation, hoping external approval will boost their self-esteem.
  * This creates neediness and makes people resist change, as predictability provides comfort and control.
  * Choosing a partner with whom you feel safe being vulnerable is crucial for a strong relationship. Comquer challanges together not existing apart. 
  * True happiness stems from genuine connections and shared experiences, not external achievements or validation.
  * A successful career with a troubled personal life can be miserable, while an average career with a strong marriage can be delightful.
  Transcript:
  Chris Williamson
  Sacrifice self-worth to get validation in the hopes that if we have sufficient validation, we will finally be able to have some self-worth, uh, sacrificing the thing that you want For the thing that's supposed to get it. And, um, yeah, this neediness insight that, you know, it's kind of, it's not too dissimilar to that point from before, from Sam Ovens, where you think, fuck, we have these expectations, Public expectations, familial expectations. People don't like change. There's also another reason that people don't like change, I think, is because we want to be able to predict, project out where somebody is going to be in future. And the more easy they are to predict, as in the more reliably they fall into our model of them, the less we need to sort of worry about going to happen. You know, I don't worry about Chris. He's a good guy. He'll, he'll, he'll, he'll be on board with the next, whatever Trump policy, or he'll be on board with the next Kamala policy, or he'll be on board with the next, whatever, because he Was with the last ones. But if you start to deviate a little bit, whether it's political ideology, philosophy, life direction, career, temperament, in its extreme, this is sort of bipolar, right? It's, oh my God, I'm so scared of whether or not this person's going to be high or low or whatever it might be. But in smaller ways, the same discomfort comes through us because we're like, I don't know if they're still going to sort of be here in a year's time. What if they outgrow me? What if they outgrow our friendship? What if they start to disagree with something that's really sacred to me? So in that way, people who don't necessarily go along with the crowd are seen as a threat in many ways. So yeah, I think just something to consider. All right, some more dating stuff. This insight from Chris Bumstead. Awesome episode with him last year. And I was asking him about how to choose a good partner, how to know when you've sort of found the one. And Chris said, find someone who you just feel safe being a burden to. You're not going to intentionally be a burden, but sometimes you suck. Sometimes you're a burden. And even if you don't feel safe being like that around your partner, if you have to withhold things from them and put on that show, you're never going to feel safe around them. And you're not going to want to be there for them as much when they're being a burden as well. You just become these two people dividing and conquering all of your problems rather than taking on the world together. I think I always felt like I wanted to be great at everything I did and great at what I pursued. And I never expected to be as good as I was. So it would just be such an interesting relief to be able to give myself to think you are going to be great. You are going to have all these things that you want, but you're also going to realize that they're not as important as you think they are. You're going to come to the realization where your relationships and your values and everything you enjoy and experience aren't going to come down to spectacular moments on stage. They're going to be much simpler than that. They're just going to be these moments where you're being yourself and the people who love you for that are going to be everything. It's awesome. You know, this guy who has conquered the sport has sort of defined an entire generation of bodybuilders and then bowed out at 30 is able to say, completed it. But even in the process of completing it six times in a row, the big wins weren't the big wins. The big wins were the little ones. And they were the shares and the opportunity for me to celebrate what I'd done with people who cared about me, who knew me. And it's great and magnificent and impressive and all the rest of it. But it wasn't what mattered. You know, a successful career and a terrible marriage can make your life miserable. An average career and an amazing marriage can make your life delightful. So you need to choose wisely. ([TimeÂ 0:50:00](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b1989bfe-aec3-4e88-9a3b-5fb2c9146fb5))
- **Relationship Advice**
  * To assess relationship health, consider if being compared to your partner is a compliment, if you'd want a child to date them, and if you're genuinely fulfilled or just avoiding loneliness.
  * A strong relationship should feel like a safe refuge where you can be yourself.
  * Find a partner who believes in your dreams, encourages your growth, works alongside you, and appreciates what you have.
  * Ignore those with unrealistic standards and focus on finding a partner with whom you connect authentically.
  * Take responsibility for your own happiness and growth rather than blaming others for your shortcomings. Donât be an incel.
  Transcript:
  Chris Williamson
  I think almost everything in here, if someone told you you're a lot like your partner, would this be a compliment to you? Are you in love with just the idea, or would you want your future child, imagined child, to date someone like your partner? Those three are sort of taking you out of the situation and imagining that you're somebody else, you're something else. It's for a different person. So that's creating a little bit of psychological distance. Are you truly fulfilled or just less lonely is a fantastic insight around the reason that we suck so much in relationships is that we're terrified of being alone. And that means that we stay in relationships or we accept relationships that we shouldn't do because familiar loneliness or familiar partnership is more enjoyable than unfamiliar Loneliness. And that's not good. Are you able to unapologetically be yourself or do you feel the need to show up differently to please your partner? I think that a lot of that is around the level of openness, the level of comfort that you have. How much do you need to self-edit? Now, the question around the person that's your best friend is the one that you have the least filter with and that you can sit in silence with without having to fill it. So it's the person that you can talk the most with in an unencumbered way and the person that you can shut up the most with in an unencumbered way.
  Speaker 2
  And if that's not your partner, then you're struggling because your relationship should feel like home.
  Chris Williamson
  It should feel like a house with a sturdy roof and strong foundations and shit gets thrown at it all the time and rain comes down and there's weather and there's heat and there's cold but Inside of that house is the one safe refuge that you have you can lose your job status your financial position can fall away your health can break down, your friends can leave you, but You have this one safe place and it's in another person. It's in them. And if you can't be yourself with that person, the entire house does not exist.
  Speaker 2
  It's fake. So you need to make sure that you can be yourself with your partner or else you have no safe refuge from the world, which is fucking terrifying.
  Chris Williamson
  On the dating line, Hormozy dropped a fucking slammer the other day, which I want to talk to him about the next time I speak to him. If you find a girl who believes in your dreams more than you do, who makes you want to be a better man, who's willing to work alongside you to get there and is grateful for whatever you have, Just marry her. That's how you make marriage an easy yes. How you make marriage an easy yes is by having a girl who has those. If you find a girl who believes in your dreams more than you do, who makes you want to be a better man, who's willing to work alongside you to get there and is grateful for whatever you have, Just marry her. The rest of the stuff will sort itself out, man. I really do get that sense. Maybe I'm getting soft in my old age. I don't know. I guess there was one final element. I got asked a bunch of questions about the black pill and stuff and sort of incels the last time on a Q&A at some point recently. And, um, it's kind of an unfalsifiable, um, philosophy in a lot of ways, because there's many kernels of truth in it, you know, um, realizations about what women want, uh, physically In a partner and the fact that some men just, no matter how many pushups they do, they're not going to get there. It's tough. It's a hard biological limit.
  Speaker 2
  But there is a very specific cohort of men, frustrating men, guys who have got nothing going for them, no drive in their life.
  Chris Williamson
  They're uncomfortable in their own skin. They're endlessly miserable. They keep complaining about women having too high standards. It's like, bruh, your standards for yourself are through the fucking floor. Your friends don't want to hang out with you. You don't want to hang out with you. Why do you think a woman would want to hang out with you? And how is this their fault that they've got too high standards? You suck. You suck. Your friends don't want to hang with you. You don't want to hang with you. Why lay at the feet of women the fact that they have got too high standards? I am all for it. I will fucking die on the hill of fighting for more empathy for men, right? And I have been thrown under the bus many times for doing so. Again, be able to walk this tightrope where I'm so soy-cooked that the Manosphere considers me to be blue-pilled, but I'm also such a misogynist that Guardian readers think that I'm
  Speaker 2
  Andrew Tate from Wish. And I don't care anymore.
  Chris Williamson
  Like I don't care about being misjudged by people who don't understand what I'm trying to achieve. And there's a group of people out there, maybe the large majority who are reasonable and who understand that it's not zero sum when it comes to empathy, who realize that you can raise Up men without dragging down women, that you can support women without forgetting about the challenges of men, that you can tell men that they need to pick themselves up by their bootstraps And actually do some work without forgetting that those men have got challenges that need structural support from society at large, and we need initiatives, and we need investment, And that some women do have two high standards. Some women do have skewed perspectives of what they're worth, but you're not gonna get into a relationship with them in any case. What's your goal? With screaming at these harpies on the internet, these like retarded women who go onto these dating shows and are like, I'm gonna get a guy who's got like six feet six and he's got like Six figures and he's got a six inch dick. Like, are you really, really going to go and change them? Are you gonna U-turn them and turn that chick into wifey no you're not you're getting frustrated because you think that they are a representation of women at large but that woman by design Sucks so you're not going to hang out with her so just don't pay attention to her and move toward the chicks that are perfectly normal that there are so many fucking awesome women out there Who want to get into a relationship, who just want a man who's got those traits that we talked about before. Yeah, that special category of men who don't have anything going for them, no drive, uncomfortable in their own skin, endlessly miserable, complaining all the time, and laid at the Feet of women. Dude, point the fucking finger in the mirror. ([TimeÂ 0:55:47](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9449516e-c2d2-40ff-bc27-7d9beb2a6417))
