- Embracing Vulnerability and Self-Reflection for Personal Growth
  Summary:
  The speaker recalls a pivotal moment when a friend made him realize the negative impact of his shame, fear, and lack of awareness on his relationships.
  This triggered a journey of self-reflection, where he questioned his beliefs about relationships, marriages, friendships, and personal well-being. He highlighted the importance of comparing oneself to higher standards to realize the possibilities beyond mediocrity.
  Through the guidance of supportive individuals and seeking therapy, he embraced vulnerability, surrendered to self-examination, and acknowledged his flaws and past wrongdoings.
  The transition from denial to awareness was challenging, leading to a period of heightened strain in relationships without healing.
  The speaker emphasizes that self-reflection and awareness without subsequent healing can worsen the situation, underscoring the necessity of addressing and mending one's faults for true personal growth.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And he said, I see a lot of shame in you, I see a lot of fear in you, and I worry that that's dramatically negative and impacting a lot of your relationships. It was more in depth than that. I mean, we talked for another probably 20, 30 minutes about what he saw and I just tried to take a posture. I mean, initially when somebody says something like that to you, like cut you, right? Like how dare you? I have great relationships. You've known me for a long time now. We were talking about this at least 10 years, if not more. And I wouldn't have said six or seven years ago that I had bad relationships. I would have said I had really good relationships. If you'd asked me how my marriage was five years ago, I would have said, oh, I guess six or seven, we have our challenges, but we get along. And compared to where it is today, I would say it was like like a two. I Just didn't know you know, I think about this idea of you know, everything's relative. So like world class is the best you've ever seen You know, you ask somebody who's only eating at fast food. What's their favorite restaurant in the world? They're gonna tell you a fast food restaurant, right? So, you know the question we have to ask ourselves is like What do we have to compare it to and are we talking about relative or an absolute terms? And to be honest, I don't think I had been exposed three years ago to what was possible in relationships or what was possible in marriages. Like I had not seen marriages up close where I was like, I was comparing my marriage to what I'd seen in other marriages. And I felt like we were doing fine. Like we were probably right in the middle of the ballpark. I think what this person did for me was open my eyes to like, there was a lot more out there. There's a lot more possibilities that I didn't know. That was like a seminal moment of like a warning shot across the bow of, oh my gosh, like I need to probably go and look and study like, who am I? What makes great friendships? What am I giving to my relationships? How do I think about my marriage? And like, what am I doing in my marriage? And like, how should it be? And am I willing to settle for an interior life filled with anxiety and shame and fear? Am I willing to settle for a marriage where things are being hidden and, and there's disconnection and division, right? Am I willing to settle for friendships that maybe don't go that last 10% and create that really meaningful, deep connection? Am I willing to settle for a physical body that is overweight and out of shape and likely going to become diseased? And so I think that was a major moment And then that led into, you know, really finding, finding these different people who have shaped and changed my life, including an incredible counselor Who I started working with and bringing to the surface a lot of these issues that I didn't even know were there. Yeah. I mean, I look back on the person I was even three years ago and I, I was certainly far better than I was 10 years prior, but I was compared to sort of where I was now. I felt very shut down and frustrated and irritable and competitive.
  Speaker 2
  And I feel a lot of those things myself in terms of competitive and, you know, maybe a bit more anxious than I should be. What was the next step that you took in this journey that sort of like, okay, well, I realized something. I feel it, now what?
  Speaker 1
  I don't wanna sit here and pretend this like self -reliance is the thing that got me through this period in my life, because it felt like it happened to me and it happened for me. It didn't feel like that I somehow figured out, like outsmarted the world, outsmarted my shame and fear. It felt like I had these sort of people be put into my life and these revelations that started to occur that all of a sudden, I mean, I think there's an old adage that like when the student Is ready, the teacher appears. And I think there's very much, there's a choice I had to make three years ago that was like, am I going to pretend like everything's fine? Because that's what everything in me, that's what my false self wanted to do. No, screw you, you're wrong. You don't know what you're talking about. Who are you? You just met me. You can't, you don't know, you don't know me. You don't know anything about me. And it was like, I remember having this very distinct choice to make. And I remember being like, if I, if I continue on the path that I'm on, that would have denied, you know, sort of this idea of like self -promotion, self -protection, right? That's what, that's what our false self wants us to do. Go around self -promote, self -protect, because then we don't have to really be vulnerable. Now we also are shut down and we can't have great relationships. We can't figure out the real of us that comes through. But that was the choice. And I remember kind of it was an act of surrender of being like, I have to take the risk that I'm going to take a look at myself and I'm not going to like myself very much. I'm going to admit things to myself that that are ugly and that I've done more wrong, maybe, than I'm willing to admit. And that I've hurt people that I care about. That was the choice that I had to make. And I and and I remember very clearly saying, OK, I, you know, I surrender and I want to know. And then things started to change ever so slowly. I mean, there's a weird dip that occurs. I feel like when you, you know, when you go from denial to awareness, it's actually way worse. So like the awareness of your faults and awareness of your shortcomings without the healing of those is actually puts you in a far worse position. And so I would say that sort of the period of time from three years ago to years ago was horrible. Like it was a it was not a it was not a year of joy. In fact, if anything, it felt like harder. My relationships felt more strained. And I think it was because I was becoming acutely aware of how broken they were as a result, mostly as a result of me. I mean, yes, other people's brokenness too, mostly result of me, but I didn't have any healing in it. I didn't know how to get healing. And that season was just an awareness building season, looking back on that. But it's awful. If you gain awareness without healing, it's way worse than not being aware.

- The Pitfalls of Playing the Hero Role
  Summary:
  Engaging in heroics without being asked can remove agency from others, creating a victim mentality.
  Trying to help or give without understanding the real needs of individuals can unintentionally hurt them by taking away their dignity. True care comes from deep relationships where needs are understood and respected, not from unsolicited acts that strip away agency.
  A balanced relationship requires reciprocity and mutual respect, avoiding power dynamics that create hero-victim dynamics.
  By reflecting on past behaviors and making amends, one can cultivate genuine connections based on understanding and care.

  Speaker 2
  But if they say, nope, I want to buy dinner tonight, I say, okay, thank you. And the key there is they have agency now. They have agency. And so the resentment doesn't build even unconsciously.
  Speaker 1
  Correct. In psychology circles, there's this idea of a triangle where you have a victim and a hero and like a judge or a prosecutor and and heroes are those who are without knowing the good like They tell themselves that they want to do good for other people and what they're really doing and by the I relate very strongly to this, this is a lot of action that I see myself having done And do, is to cover up my own shame and insecurities and sort of to push down the pain that I feel. It's like, well, I'm going to go external and go try to help somebody almost against their will. Like they didn't ask me to help if they did ask me to help, my response to them is so outsized that it removes agency from them. Buying dinner is a very small example of this and I've got, unfortunately, a lot of bigger examples of this. I probably have really engaged in, I would say, dramatic heroics five or six times in my life where I perceived somebody was in grave danger. They needed my help and I sprung into action and did this dramatic thing for this other person. And in my head, the thing I'm going to get is, oh, thank you so much, Brent. You're amazing. I'm so grateful for you. Now, if you hear even the thoughts in my head, it's all about me. So it's actually not about the other person. Yes, I can justify it based on the other person, but really it's about me. Five out of five or six out of six times, it has been met with initial, oh man, thank you so much. Like this is incredible. Wow, I'm like blown away at your generosity. And I'm like, oh, I got all the good And, and then I end up not having a very good relationship with those people. And it shocks me. And it almost feels like a slap in the face. Like, how could they, how could they do that? How could they not be better friends with me as a result of this? And then when I started doing the sessions and started working with her, it became clear this like, oh, heroes create victims because you're removing all agency from them and you are Telling them that they can't help themselves, that they are helpless. And when you do that, you are creating who is diminished and insulted. Now, again, in the moment, that's not how it feels, but that's where we're constantly chewing on and assessing our environments. A great example of this, and this is not a close personal relationship, I remember my wife and I one Christmas, we had a public school teacher who we knew and got to be friends with and we Were kind of sitting around the dinner table one night and she was sharing. She's like, that's heartbreaking. She's like, you know, these kids around Christmas that I work with and this particularly poor school district, you know, they don't have any Christmas presents. They don't need Christmas. Like, there's no joy. And it really like touched my wife and I were like, wow, like, what if we did this dramatic act? And anonymously, of course, we bought like $30 ,000 worth of Christmas gifts for like every kid in that school. And in our heads, we were like, this is amazing. This is wonderful. These kids, you know, you can imagine the kids are like, Oh, we wouldn't have had Christmas, but now we have Christmas and wow, somebody cares for us and loves us. Like that's what we were hoping to have done. And, and so we did it. And the response from the, you know, small group people that knew about it was like, this is incredible. You all are so generous, you know, pat, pat, pat on the back. We're feeling great. We're in the we're in the Christmas spirit. Oh, what joy? You know all this stuff and then it was about a month later and I followed up with the teacher and I was just like hey, how did that how did I go and She was like it was really good. You know everyone's like grateful, you know, whatever. There's a few people who? Who had some challenges. And I was like, had challenges with us giving giving gifts. She said, well, some of the parents of the kids felt felt really insulted by it. And then it like hit me and I even like, you know, I'm trying to get emotional that it like hit hit it cut me so deeply because I realized what I'd done, but we had done my wife and I had done. We had taken away the dignity of those families and yeah, they couldn't buy their kids Christmas gifts, but they were going to do something for them. Whatever they could do for them. And instead, like any kid, you give a kid a present. Kids are like, amazing, you know? But then it started asking all kinds of questions. Well, why can't you buy me that present? Do you not love me? Why do these other people care more for me than you do? Kids don't understand how money works. They don't understand how some people have more and some people have less. They don't understand anything about that. And so what I'd inadvertently done when I was trying to be kind and generous Was I didn't put myself in the position to understand what the real consequences were gonna be the second third Order consequences Yeah, a kid would have had you know less toys to play with at Christmas That's not the point of Christmas. I missed I missed the plot the point of Christmas is to show love and care. And in doing what I did, I short circuited the ability for those families to experience love and care. And I hurt them. There's a great book out there called When Helping Hurts. And it afterwards, actually, somebody gave it to me, and I read it. And I mean, you talk about being cut deeply. It's a book about when you try to help and it hurts people. It's one of the best books I've ever read on sort of philanthropy and how to think about caring for those who you don't have a relationship with. I think that's the bottom line is like it all comes down to we can't go wrong if we're in deep relationship with somebody and we are respecting what their are, where if somebody asks me For help, you're not a hero if somebody asks you for help and you rise to meet the need. That's called being a good friend. Where you become a hero and you create victims is when you don't know somebody, don't know their needs. They never asked you to do something and you rise to meet a need they don't have and And in turn, you take away agency and dignity from them. So it's things like that. I mean, these are these are deep waters, right? These are things that are challenging stuff that we don't talk about a lot. But this is the stuff that I've like. Some ways to explore the stuff in me and to see how frequently I am engaging in this maladaptive behavior under the name of goodness and virtue and ([Time 0:18:49](https://share.snipd.com/snip/95493c04-b623-4ce4-84dc-cca6feb92db6))
    - **Note:** Friendships are built on equality not power dynamics. Buying dinner and friendship. Doing good things for others never letting them help you hurts the relationship and takes away their agency which is unfair. No one wants to be a victim on your hero’s journey. They want to be on that with you.
- Living out of Fear or Genuine Love and Care
  Summary:
  The speaker reflects on the concept of elders versus the elderly, emphasizing the importance of being outwardly focused rather than self-focused.
  Meeting elders who exhibit genuine care and love, regardless of circumstances, shows a life filled with joy, lightness, and freedom. This reflection leads to the realization that life can be lived either out of fear, shame, and hiding, or out of genuine love and care for others and oneself.
  The speaker suggests that everything in life revolves around these two ways of living, highlighting the contrast between fear-driven scarcity and a life of love and care.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Right. Exactly. And vice versa, right? If I did buy the meal, it was a little bit like, you start playing with ideas in your head, oh, am I only a checkbook? Do people really like me? And it's like, well, you're the one who insisted on buying dinner. And you're like, well, but the other person could have insisted on buying dinner more, you know? Oh, you start getting into this like weird psychology. You didn't fight back Right. You get the old alligator arms, you know? And so now it's like the inverse of that. And I think this is like a good metaphor for life. Like I think that the more that I meet what I would call elders, so there's a difference between elders and elderly. Elderly are like self -focused in curved, like Blaise would call it, incurvature, right? They're incurred on themselves. They're irritable. Life is all about them and what they need and they're scared and fearful. And you've got elders who are the inverse of this, right? Who are outwardly focused, right? The more I meet these types of elders that are genuinely caring and loving, the more that I see them exhibiting this type of behavior, the more that I see them, like no matter their circumstance, In good circumstances or in bad circumstances, they live with a joy and a lightness and a freedom. And then you see Elder Lee and sort of now I can pull it back and see in my life that like no matter my circumstances, like I'm living in fear shame and hiding. And so it's like I think that's the thing that we're really talking about here is like these are all even like maybe the second teardown or the third teardown like at the basement of all This stuff at the very core of all this stuff is there are really only two ways to live. You're going to live out of fear, or you're going to live out of genuine love and care for others. And love and care for yourself. And like that's it. Like everything else rises between those two. Like, like fear driven is scarce. ([Time 0:28:46](https://share.snipd.com/snip/44483af2-15da-4d5b-b3ed-15d7f546d6dc))

- True friendship is about telling each other the hard truth
  Summary:
  The pinnacle of friendship lies in telling each other the real truth, even the hard truths that offer no personal gain and may risk losing everything.
  This vulnerability and surrendering control to the other person shows the depth of true friendship, as demonstrated when a friend took a risk to confront and challenge the speaker's self-deprecating behavior with a stern voice.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I was like, oh my gosh, yeah, you're right. And around that time, another good friend of ours, Patrick, I was on the phone with him and the best of friends tell you the real truth. Like the pinnacle of friendship is to tell each other the real truth, the hard truth, the truth that, the truth that you gain nothing from and you have everything to lose. Cause that is true vulnerability. That is truly giving the other person control. And I remember Patrick took a risk and I'd said something, I used to make jokes about being a fat kid, right? This is that identity that was imprinted upon me. And they're funny, people laugh at jokes about being fat, right, self -effacing and all this stuff. And he goes, would you knock that shit off? And it was like very stern voice. He was like not okay. ([Time 0:44:04](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0170699e-828e-41a6-ae5e-b6492592ac4d))
    - **Note:** True friendship is saying something someone needs to hear but they don’t want to and you have everything to lose and nothing to gain by saying it. Telling hard truths with nothing to gain. However spend our days is how we spend our lives habits are vital. Ask others how they want to be loved. When do you feel seen and appreciated. Operate through abundance and love and care. Treat others with love and care act out of abundance. Open yourself up to being taken advantage of in a relationship to gauge someone but create positive sum mindset. You create higher returns by treating people well and using less debt. You can’t create a long term sustainable life with transactional relationships. Need long term relationships. Understand and ask people if they’re being transactional do they want to be transactional and if they do then you know that. Don’t do it in a bad way just an obersvant way non accusatory
- Patterns in Conflict Resolution
  Summary:
  In conflict resolution, people generally follow three basic moves: move against, move towards, and move away.
  Move against involves confrontational behavior to make the other person submit, move towards seeks to gloss over the issue for the sake of relational harmony without addressing the underlying problem, and move away entails isolation. Understanding these patterns can help in predicting behavior and navigating conflict effectively.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And again, the response that you wanna have is when you see somebody have an outsized reaction, is to be, it can feel stupid, belittle them. Conflict pattern is something that I really have enjoyed studying. So we all have three basic moves in conflict. And actually, if you watch these, it's fun. Like now, it's like whenever I engage in conflict, I know my pattern and I very much know my pattern. And I try to guess then what other people's patterns are. You can watch people go through these phases, but it's called move against, which is like, no, you're wrong, screw you, I want to make you submit to me, right? Like it's like very much like a forced submission, right? So this is somebody who gets up in your face, who's yelling or who's like kind of like talking down to you. Like a very, very confrontational, right? That's kind of like one phase. And by the way, again, we do all three of these. We just depends on the order, but we all have an order to how we do these things. And then by the way, how they interact with one another is super interesting as well. The second one is move towards the person. So the first one's move against. Second one's move towards. Move towards is we need to be okay. I'm not okay unless we're okay. Let's just gloss over whatever's happened. It's okay. It'll be fine. You know, let's just water to the bridge. Let's just move on. Right? It's avoidant. Well, it's avoidant in a way that is, it feels very relational, but it's actually not because it's not for the good of the other. It's actually for their good. They want to have things be okay, but it actually doesn't address the underlying issue at all. And then the third one is move away. So this is the isolate. And so if you watch all of your conflict will follow one of like, we'll follow that pattern. ([Time 1:03:43](https://share.snipd.com/snip/69839783-e5a7-4b56-a992-3c27db33ca27))
    - **Note:** Conflict patterns move against move towards and move away. Debt creates fragility so it’s proportional to the robustness of the business. The more stable and resistant the more debt it can take on. Debt creates fragility doesn’t allow you to take advantage of inevitable crisis. Long vs short term thinking effects outcomes you would take out less debt you would act differently if all your relationships had to be long term. People don’t structure their thinking to view relationships over time not just today or tomorrow
- Understanding Personality Typing for Empathy and Better Relationships
  Summary:
  Understanding the four axes of Myers Briggs - energy source, information processing, decision-making, and lifestyle preference - helps in gaining empathy and improving relationships by comprehending how individuals operate differently based on these parameters.
  Recognizing that people have diverse primary lenses in life enables better understanding and acceptance of others' perspectives and behaviors, enhancing personal and professional interactions.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So is everyone you meet. They're weird because they're mixtures of all these different axes of how we sit on these things, right? How we, how the interplay and interact with one another. But I can tell you, as an example, once I understand sort of the four axes of Myers Briggs. So where do you gather your energy is the first one. So this is introverted, extroverted. This is not how you show up in the world. This is where you gather energy. So introverts can appear extroverted can appear introverted. That's where this like sort of you get these very basic ideas about how the world works and you sort of hear like a little bit of these things and you get misperceptions of what they actually Mean. So it's really important to understand. Are you getting your energy from inner life or are you more solar powered, right? Getting your energy from other people and the world. The second one is how do you process information? Are you intuitive or are you high sensing? This tells you a lot about where somebody starts in how they think about life. So sensors think about life in the present. They're present oriented. They walk from the present into the future. They're very practical, they're very reasonable, they're very rational people. Intuitives, like maniacs like me, we start into the future and then we walk back into the present. So we get excited about ideas. We're like, oh, we vision this future. Oh, what might that be? How might that work? What might we do? Who could come along with us? Right? And then somebody says, a sensor comes along and says, excuse I'm glad that you're 10 years in the future right now and you have these grandiose visions of where you're going. We've got to make payroll this week. And by the way, that's on fire and that's on fire and like we need to be here. So you need both, right? That's the beauty. None of these like being introverted or extroverted, they're just strengths and weaknesses, right? There's always upsides and downsides to each one of these. But once I can tell, okay, where's somebody powered from, right? How does somebody process information? The third one is how do they make decisions? This is a really important one. So thinkers and feelers, two basic categories. Thinkers are all about ideas and about truth. So they're seeking truth. They're seeking ideas. They're very oriented. They want to get things ordered up and neatly packaged. That's how they make decisions. So they're making decisions based on what is truth and how am I seeking it? Feelers on the other hand, by the way, most men are thinkers. So 70% of men are thinkers, 30% are feelers. 70% of women are feelers, 30% are thinkers. When we go back up to the sensing and intuitive, it's about 75, 25, sensing to intuitive. So 75% of people are present oriented, 25% are future oriented. And so I'm like the super weird combination, right? Where I'm external focused, I'm an extrovert who is intuitive. So right there, I'm in the 25%, right? Introvert, extroverts 50, 50. I'm in 25%. And then I'm in the 30% of men that are feelers. So feelers base everything on relationships and values. So we feel our way to decision -making. It's how will it impact the world around me? How will it impact my relationships? How will it make people feel? Now again, it's not like I don't have a rational side and I can't consider ideas and it doesn't mean a thinker can't feel anything. That's not the point. The point is which is the primary lens that you look through in life, right? And the last one which is really interesting Is lifestyle. This is a J versus a P, a judger versus a perceiver And it's really about how you like to move through the world Do you move through the world in sort of an orderly way? Do you like structure? Do you like to you have a decision to make, you gather information, you make a decision, you move on, right? You like things structured. Or are you a maniac like me who is a perceiver, who is kind of open for whatever? I loop on things, I need to be forced to make a decision. I need a deadline to do things. And so again, if you understand people based on these four parameters, then you could really have a lot of empathy. Like my wife and I did this personally testing together in each other's presence. And I'll never forget my, we're going through this list of like, are you more like this? Are you more like this? You know, whatever. And she's like, of course this, like only a maniac would be And I'm like, yep, I'm the other one. And literally at one point she looked over and I could tell, but like, look on her face was like, I have children with this man. Like what, who is this? Right. But again, we're all in our own heads. We think that the world works the same way, but for us, it created a tremendous amount of empathy. Like she, the how I made decisions and how she makes decisions, by the way, we're opposite on every single category. You can imagine that might create some friction in a marriage. Same thing in work relationships, right? Right. You asked what do people mostly get wrong? I think we get wrong is we assume everyone like us. And so if you have a certain attribute set, you tend to want to look at the whole world through that attribute set and say, oh, well, everyone I hire should have that attribute set. And if they don't, they're bad. They're bad fit. Just totally not true. And so we think about a lot of this stuff as we are recruiting. We think about a lot of like, okay, what are the things that we're asking this person to do and what type of person would be good for that? And then the other one that I've really enjoyed is Enneagram because it really shows you what is your underlying insecurity and what are your primary drives. So there's nine numbers and each one has a very different set of pluses, minuses, strengths and weaknesses. And so when you're able, again, none of them are perfect.
