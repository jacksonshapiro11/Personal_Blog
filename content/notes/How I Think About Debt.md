- Summary: Some old businesses in Japan lasted for centuries without taking on debt, which helped them endure many challenges. Debt can limit the range of outcomes one can handle in life, making it important to consider carefully. Viewing debt as a constraint on flexibility can help prioritize having options in a volatile world.

### Highlights

- I think this is the most practical way to think about debt: **As debt increases, you narrow the range of outcomes you can endure in life.**
  That’s so simple. But it’s different from how debt is typically viewed, which is a tool to pull forward demand and leverage assets, where the only downside is the cost of capital (the interest rate).
  Two things are important when you view debt as a narrowing of endurable outcomes.
  One is you start to ponder how common volatility is.
  I hope to be around for another 50 years. What are the odds that during those 50 years I will experience one or more of the following: Wars, recessions, terrorist attacks, pandemics, bad political decisions, family emergencies, unforeseen health crises, career transitions, wayward children, and other mishaps?
  One-hundred percent. *The odds are 100%*.
  When you think of it like that, you take debt’s narrowing of survivable outcomes seriously.
  The other is you think about the kinds of volatile events that could do you in.
  Financial volatility is an obvious one – you find yourself unable to make your debt payments. But there’s also psychological volatility, where for whatever reason you can’t mentally endure your job any longer. There’s family volatility, which can be anything from divorce to caring for a relative. There’s child volatility, which could fill a book. Health volatility, political volatility, on and on. The world’s a wild place.
  I’m not an anti-debt zealot. There’s a time and place, and used responsibly it’s a wonderful tool.
  But once you view debt as narrowing what you can endure in a volatile world, you start to see it as a constraint on the asset that matters most: having options and flexibility. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hy657h244f5kwq56ddmx6ayg))
    - **Note:** debt narrows your range of outcomes and makes you more fragile
