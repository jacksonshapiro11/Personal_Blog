### Highlights

- Didn’t look at what he could succeed but what they could contribute to society through their products. They were customer obsessed and if you couldn’t deliver for the customer hp had no place for you.
  Packard is writing this a year before he dies. The desire for older people to pass their intelligence down to the next generation.
  HP set the tone for all valley start ups starting in a garage revolutionizing an industry and becoming one of the biggest companies in the world.
  Jobs got his first job assembling frequency counters at hp after he asked hulet for some parts to assemble one. They were nice enough to give a young Steve his first job and throughout they instilled creativity and innovation in the company that was present long after they left.
  Customer obsession over all

- Highlights an institution and person who changed his life. A Stanford professor believing in him help spur him to go out on his own.
  Reading learning and creating from a young age. Incredibly determined a formidable man. In high school sports he learned when talent is similar and teamwork is strong the team that wins is the one with the most will. His dad got him a wild horse who constantly tried to buck him off at 11 his dad wouldn’t let him quit until he controlled the horse. Hire A players from a strong team
  He wanted to go out on his own after college but I stress he worked at GE as it was the Great Depression and he learned many valuable lesson in doing this. Had a boss who told him not to focus on electronics because they were a dying industry. Bill didn’t listen and followed his curiosity.

    - **Note:** Bill followed his curiosity and had people believe in him from a young age. He was constantly learning and growing. He realized when talent was similar it was all down to grit. There are others who try to doubt you dont listen to them fuck them.
      All these people have high agency and personal circulums
- Personal communication is necessary to back up written instruction when at GE he went to the factory floor to help out with quality control. Seeing from the front he was able to improve to near 100% efficiency by communicating to the factory workers better. Learned management by walking around.
  Has desired to form a company for awhile and after many meetings bill left GE to start his own thing leaving behind security excited to go into the unknown. He was going to classes in the morning working at his start up during the day and had a job at night. The HP garage is credited as the start of the valley.

    - **Note:** importance of communication and management by walking around and seeing from the front he was able to optimize efficiency.
      He went out and risked everything the comfort of his company to try something different. He went to school during the day and worked at night. This founded the valley
- HP felt like they had no limits and did a lot their self. These men shaped by WW2 thought what problems could they solve and often through hands on work would solve it themselves.
  HP was profitable in the first year and every year after. More companies die from indigestion than starvation. Ran debt light. Always believed in growing for profit. This was driven by his depression background seeing debt light companies survive while burdened companies got crushed.
  Couldn’t be banked by bofa so went to a smaller regional bank who then had a relationship with Wells Fargo. The importance of forging a relationship and doing the work to believe in people over time. They asked their customers for feedback which helped them develop adjacent products. Packard always took a lower salary than he could’ve taken and invested in their people.

    - **Note:** The company was very high agency believing they could get things done and grew slower than they could’ve with less debt to be more anti fragile. Profitable every year. They took lower salaries in the c-suite to invest in their people.
      Got food and direct feedback from customers.
      More companies die from indegestion than starvation
- Long term thinking never optimizing for the next quarter.
  They didn’t want to create me too products they wanted to innovate. This is echoed by jobs and bezos even if the market isn’t massive make a differentiated offering.
  The importance of learning and playing the game they started out making electrical equipment in the 60s but eventually were selling 20 bn of computers in the 90s innovating with the times
  Had an employee who wanted to make a display monitor this was shot down but he continued to show it to customers and build it and got good feedback. Hp ended up selling 17k of these and he got a medal for insubordination and entrepreneurship. Didn’t want to run against the grain but thought he had a good product.

    - **Note:** Long term thinking they didn’t want to be fast followers but build internal skills and capabilities same as Amazon. Innovation not copying. There was a crazy entrepreneurial culture and they rode the waves of technology constantly pivoting and disrupting themselves
- Work with people with excessively high standards. Previously had a 3/1000 failure rate which they thought was good the Japanese unit believed they could be better and had a failure rate of 1/100000 pushing people to be their best and their targets on quality were way too low. Learning from others. Raised targets in many plants. In Japan they wanted to be as accurate as possible in Cali they wanted to be as quick as possible. Gains in quality come from meticulous attention to detail and every step must be carefully as possible not as quick as possible. Vs move fast and break things. Two ways to build a business. 
  Constantly optimistic learned about westward expansion and thought there were no new avenues. He was very wrong as he was on the frontier. The frontier is ever present and ever expanding. Dangerous for all with riches for the brave. Growth comes through innovation.
