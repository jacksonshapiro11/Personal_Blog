### Highlights

- The active phase is the bloodiest and worst phase and a movement is defined and made better with a shorter active phase. Creativity usually follows the active phase. The active phase is sterile for creativity but success or failure from a mass movement sparks creativity regardless of the result success or failure. Movements subordinate creativity to the movement replace creation with propaganda whatever moves the movement forward. Fanatic is blind and cocky thinks he understands the universe he’s positive of its secrets thinks he’s right. Active phases with clear goals are better than active phases with unclear goals this lasts longer. Movements that are longest are religious or militaristic in some ways. The quality of the leader is important in growing the movement and stopping it like ghandi or Lincoln. More submissive people are more easily controlled by a movement. A goal a nation can continue to run towards and spark a mass movement when need be is vital but the ongoing mass movement must be avoided. Think of ideas like the American dream and increased living standards that fires Americans forward. These ideas must be indefinite and unlimited not fixed and close minded. When a country stagnates it might need a mass movement to fire it forward. A mass movement shakes up the stagnant country to inspire it to be better and stronger. Fanaticism is a way to resurrect a dying nation.

    - **Note:** The active phase of a mass movement is the bloodiest when changes being an acted and then when there’s an emergent space, creativity opens up. The movement cannot have creativity in the beginning. It needs blind obedience. Subordinate people are important to control. Big ideas can persist past the active phase, but mass movements must ultimately settle down. Shared ideas benefit from ambiguity because it allows hope. Genie vs gollum.
- After the creative man of words comes in the unceeative man of words becomes a fanatic seeing their inability to create and the movement as the only way to grow in this world. Then the movement needs practical man of action to push the movement through. You need to follow this general path as part of the finality of a movement. The man of action marks the end of the dynamic phase and then crystallizes the power won within new institutions. He keeps the symbols in place but uses force to put the ideas or power gained into action. The movement becomes something that now embraces the present and allows for individual growth while still providing opiodyi the down trodden

    - **Note:** Movement start with a creative man of words than the less creative, who just re-print with a creative person, said then it goes to the man of action and crystallizes the movement and get it going. The movement still provides hope but it’s past it’s dynamic phase into its execution phase.
- Writers and people of words the educated minority set into motion the movement by discrediting the current order which sets the stage for a more violent and aggressive group to move in and take charge. Started by men of words because they can speak without threat then it goes to thr fanatics to catalyze and is put into motion by the men of action. Men of words just want to be heard and included and they won’t move forward if included by the power that be only jump at rejection. Movements can be prevented by keeping intellectuals on the inside. Fault finding men of words keep communities together or drive movements. Man of words discredits institutions create hunger for faith and create new faith undermine convictions of others so when his all done there is a group of believers and a group of lost people who refuse to fight back.

    - **Note:** Men of words left on the outside, create a movement to put themselves on the inside, usually through a belief system. People want to feel included. They then catalyze the mob and discredit institutions sowing dissension.
- Suspicion is created in between people and innocent are killed to maintain suspicion the commitment in a movement is not to the fellow man but to the movement mutual suspicion is what binds a mass movement reject unification of people. People most be unified in a movement they give up themselves in order to commit to something higher if he feels connected to a larger whole he is immortal he has been assimilated strives for unity. He must cling to the collective body. True believe eternally incomplete and insecure needs new movement. Movements put dogma above reason and make the people rely on the state for money and food and live in social housing the censorship of ideas closes the loop for anyone not previously caught people become fully dependent entities and are assimilated.

    - **Note:** Mass movements are bonded by mutual suspicion so people are not connected to the fellow man but first to the movement. People are unified and tied to a movement disposed to infinity transcending themselves. Give up themselves to be apart of something greater and creates unity. True believers are incomplete and this movement gives them purpose. Movements put the dogma above reason and make everyone dependent on the movement for their life so they perpetuate it incentive structures. People can’t think for themselves so they join these movements.
- Mass movements need blind obedience or faith. The frustrated are easier to obey to the leader and fall in line while the independent minded struggle with this fact. The frustrated make better subjects factory workers or soldiers. These people don’t mind failing because they don’t fail the group fails they are being led away from their unwanted self’s and failure isn’t seen as bad or personal. Men of action easily move as part of a movement but men of thought struggle to assimilate men of action make the world go round without thinking but just doing. Mass movements unify people through action to kill and divert thought killing time and stopping thinking creates good conditions for a movement don’t have men of action think. Democracy is lead by people who follow the people while movements are guided by leaders. Faith equips men of action that can be held in a latent mood before the time for action comes. Feel like you have the truth and are backed by a higher power believe opponents are evil and deny the self in commitment to duty. Core tenants of action. Men find salvation in action and proving your worth. Action is a substitute for a mass movement but when there is inactivity then the mass movement is ignited.

    - **Note:** You want sheep who blindly obey you. The frustrated are easier to coax than the independent minded. They would rather fail as a group they cannot face their imperfections so they die together. Mass movements have a leader and are driven by men of action not men of words who drive it forward. A leader telling people what to do. They have the truth a higher power opponents are evil and they curate faith. Salvation in action
- The only way to stop a movement is with force as well usually. We need ardent fail to exercise coercion and take down a movement. The most dogmatic movements survive those that compromise most on their values are the most fervent to impose their beliefs on others. Movements that bend the core beliefs to make it work like communism create more hate and success. A leader cannot conjure up a movement but needs to have the initial conditions for a movement right place right time. The leader is a vital and key part of the revolution and becomes the epitome of the mission and vision without that leader the movement doesn’t happen and the leader needs to play on the beliefs held by the people to take the world where it wants to go. He personifies the beliefs of the many he has to be there at the right time. Keys aren’t intelligence but audacity an iron will a defiant attitude deep self belief you know the way and maybe only you passionate hatred great understanding of human nature and community a brazen action capacity for winning and holding loyalty of able luitenents this keys to power and control over them with respect is vital. Most important are audacity faith in a holy cause deep close knit connectivity and fervent devotion from lieutenants. Leaders must believe not in the values of the mass movement but arrogant defiance of the world willing to misrepresent facts but willing to sound practical. Hero or leader often copies ideas from others.

    - **Note:** Mass movements are right place right time and they need a leader and the leader must be the epitome of the movement willing to compromise on the values to get things done misrepresent facts whatever it takes. Great movements will change, but not compromise on their values in order to serve the movement where bad ones will just compromise with others and fail. These movement strive on loyalty dogmatism and hate. The leaders are bold and brave more than anything.
- When we see ourselves as lower than everyone we hate the entire world but likewise want to become those we hate because we admire them. Hatred especially to those who think different fuel people better than anything else. We see ourselves as the true believer we lose ourselves and give up any responsibility in the mass movement and now can hate lie and kill without remorse we aren’t doing any of that. We get the right to dishonor. Hatred is the product of all mass movements. De individualize and humanize to creates movement. We imitate to belong this is a hallmark of the frustrated. We are frustrated and hate ourselves so find a new identity.

    - **Note:** Mass movements come from the frustrated people who cannot face the world and hide their identity behind this movement and depersonalize everything. We love to other groups. We learn how to hate. the hate leads to the movement which leads to violence. These people have nothing to lose fueled by hate and similarity and conflict. Blind dogmatic belief no thinking. this is a lot of mimetic models and desire. Lose ourselves in the shuffle
- Doctrines must not be understood but believed in. Doctrines insulate people from themselves and the world to follow the beliefs. Doctrine provides key to the future. Must be a higher power of knowing in the doctrine. Can’t achieve any success or happiness in the self must reject the self to join a movement. Fanatics are closer to each other than the moderates moderates and fanatics are at different poles. Mass movements have no rationalism and they’re willing to die rather than lose because they put no value in the present. All movements need worthy and tangible enemy a devil. We must create hatred together because people unite easiest over shared hatred. Hatred comes from self contempt and is often stoked by one group against another to deflect hate from their oppressors to another oppressed group the slave owners made the poor people hate slaves and not them. We hate people who have a grievance against us not the other way around for some reason. You need to despise someone but you can’t hate someone you don’t respect. Apathy doesn’t breed hate. Hatred eventually losses steam

    - **Note:** Good mass movements have doctrines that are believed with religious fervor. They put them movement over the self. The doctrine acts as a higher power. They have no self worth so they’re willing to sacrifice the self for the movement. They create contempt for a shared enemy, fear motivates more than love. Oppressors transferring oppression.
- Mass movements require self sacrifice and mass unification not self interests unity and self scarified. Movements assimilate others within the movement separating the identity from the person and making them a part of the tribe above all ie an American or Muslim. Cast the people in the role of hero’s facing action. Do not want any new people coming in insular movement no dessent. You need to make up reasons for action and depreciate the present to pry the past people just embrace the present but also give up the present. Reject the present for a better future. Movement blend the reactionary and radical. The frustrated see the present as something worthless and wasted. A man fights for what he wants not what he has.
    - **Tags:** #genie-vs-gollum, #reject-present-for-better-future, #group-dynanics, #mass-movements, #individualism, #groupthink, #present-(rob-it-of-value)
    - **Note:** Mass movements take away the individuality to create a hegamon. No dessent one idea. The come up with reasons to act and create this horrible idea of the present so everyone rejects it and fights for a better future.
- The permeant misfits are those that will never be satisfied they have a hole and want to create but realize they can never achieve the highs or success they want and are permanently lost. These become the most ardent supporters of movements. Having too many opportunities causes people to lose hope and look for movements. Like people unhappy in bubbles others are making more. The least and most successful are the most conscious Bordem like that of the housewife catalysts and provides great support for movement. Sinners or making people feel like sinners provides good kindling for a mass movement you are broken let me fix you.
- Fanatics of movements fear liberty and agency. People who want freedom are least likely to be happy in a free society they want uniformity and anonymity. Poor people who create or have community are less likely to cause problems than the over educated under appreciated poor. When the family is in good shape movements fail movements need these to be destroyed before they can take hold. Weaking the family to create a new family in the movement is key to developing new family ties and a strong foundation in a movement. People want to escape an individualistic existence we want to commit to something larger than ourselves Soviet movement works because conquered people have clear goals and community built in day 1. Promote team mindset with aggregate rewards. People want to avoid personal responsibility. Movements should be judged by how well their organization absorbs the frustrated not their core message. Collective cohesion people want to belong. People want to be part of a unique movement not one of the many. You need a disintegrated not cohesive organization for a mass movement

    - **Note:** happy people dont cause problems these movements are spawned from people who need community and structure when the family is in good shape people are ok. You need people who need to belong but have nothing to belong to and feel hopeless. Everyone needs to feel like theyre on their own hero's journey of becoming a part of a bigger whole. These people aren't free thinkers but violent and dogmatic followers. Initial conditions require a society in peril. People hate taking agency over their life and would rather be told what to do as part of this movement.
- The game of history is played by the best and worst with the majority stuck in the middle moving the cranks with no power. The ones on top have the power the ones in the bottom have nothing so they have nothing to lose and have freedom. The new poor are those most likely to to create revolutions discontent increases with the proximity ti the goal because the ignorant only know survival discontent comes from knowing the better life but not having it. Those who want many things are much more unhappy than those with a singular desire. People join mass movements to avoid freedom and agency they surrender their freedom to the movement instead of taking responsibility for themselves. Freedom is a burden and puts failure on the individual mass movements give freedom to the movements and avoid failure. Unless you can make something of yourself freedom is a burden. The right to choose when your choice is ineffectual leads to joining mass movements

    - **Note:** The people who shape history are the recently poor and rich people in power. Those who have tasted and have power. The ignorant don’t realize. People in a mass movement give up their agency because freedom is a burden when not exercise well. People, fear, responsibility and failure. The focused are the happy. The fragmented are unhappy.
- Revolutions are national religious and social and often can be more than one or a combo of many. Movements are interchangeable but it’s risky to push one movement to stop another this leads to ultimate negative. Like pushing communist vs facism. Migration is a substitute for a mass movement because they get change and a new beginning a mass movement is a type of migration.
    - **Tags:** #mass-movements, #fresh-start, #path-dependence, #initial-conditions
    - **Note:** Movements say more about the initial conditions of the people than merits of ideas. Usually people want a fresh start or something new and find that in a movement. Mass movements are interchangeable the exact one is path dependent on initial conditions. Mass movements are a function of people
- Mass movements come from the need to recreate an invent yourself not just improve. This relys on the destruction and renunciation of the past c self. Mass movements cease when it’s more about self improvement and incentives rather than the recreation and destruction of self. Once you have optimizers the innovators of the movement and innovation of the movement is dead it’s now an enterprise. People want hope over relief movements allow them the vanity of selflessness. The present prospects need to be bad that we need a substitute they need something above the self to believe in and want to give their life for that transcends the self. Often the conditions create multiple movements like nazis and communists in Germany. Because of this all mass movements are interchangeable and in conflict with each other.

    - **Note:** Mass movements are interchangeable and a product of their times more than anything. They give power the opioid of hope to reinvent themselves and once you bring in the operations people the movement is over. Mass movements destroy the self to recreate the self like a phoenix from the ashes.
- Movements start with the desire for change. And must be galvanized by a leader to create that change. Need to create a movement starting with people’s desire or need for change. Movements turn practical purpose into religious cause. Nationalism unites and galvanizes you need this core of a movement without the core pushing you have nothing. Change is wanted or resisted by successful or failing groups in a society. People afraid of the downside of the situation don’t want change. Rich people can’t get much richer and very poor people are too focused on survival the middle when galvanized with some idea of power pushes for change. Faith in the future and hope drives change movements from the French Revolution or communism have believed in a powerful doctrine that gave them hope of a better future to create. Discontent but bit destitute with the hope and power of a leader or idea. Lastly there must be an ignorance to jump in not seen by the experienced who know how hard it is.

    - **Note:** Revolutions come from the unhappy middle who desire change and something different. They have the means to push for change and the ignorance to pursue it. They then need a leader to follow. This is all based in faith and hope in the future.
- Mass movement create a readiness to die and proclivity to action. Breed fanaticism enthusiasm fervent hope and intolerance demand blind faith and single hearted allegiance all movements appeal to the same humanity. There is a difference in doctrine but a similarity that binds them and makes them effective. True moves start with frustration this creates true believers these people join and are recruited by appealing to the frustrated mind. Frustration at the heart of all these movements and movements hack frustration and these despite the fall in religion have increased in recent times

    - **Note:** movements create readiness to die through the opiod of hope and blind faith. Movements hack the deep frustration in people and exploit it for the movement. Create dogmatic unquestioning allegiance.
