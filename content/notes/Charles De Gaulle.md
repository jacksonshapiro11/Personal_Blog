### Highlights

- You’ve lost when you’ve lost the will to fight. Importance of self belief and morale is needed when this is lost all is lost. Excellence is the capacity to take pain. – No one can effect your thoughts but yourself as long as you still posses the fight you’re still in the fight never give up Victor Frankle Stoacism

    - **Note:** As long as you have the will to fight you can win, but once you lose this will and control over your mind, which only you have agency over, you are dead. Excellence is the capacity to take pain believe in yourself to no end.
- There is no long term plan or long term plan you have a goal and framework and then you need to be reactive to the world. Sure you can have an amazing idea but when the world moves under your feet you need to move with it. Action must be constructed on contingency. – Everyone has a plan until you get hit in the face. Construct a way to think and a place to go and then try to figure out how to best get there. High modernist plans are usually flawed because the map isn’t the territory. Mike Tyson Seeing like a State

    - **Note:** Clear goals, flexible execution. Everyone has a plan until they get hit in the face.
- Default aggressive and fighting the next war. Believed that technology like tanks and machine guns would be used for attack unlike in WW1 when they were used in defense this ended up being borne out to be true. This strategy he implored the French to take ended up being adopted by the nazis with high effectiveness. – Fight the next war and use second order thinking run to where the ball is going don’t focus on where it is

    - **Note:** Fight the next war and use second order thinking run to where the ball is going don’t focus on where it is. Be default aggressive and leverage technology
- Disdained accepted wisdom and practical theories instead trusting observation more – don’t live in the world you want live in the world that exists
  Leader was a master toward who’s faith and dreams are directed
  Having the ability to think about the same thing and concentrate is a skill that is fading. – The power of intense focus
  All that matters is to survive the rest is just words
  Galvanize the people ahead of attack instead of comforting them with absurd illusions of defensive security. He constantly reached out to military leaders who constantly didn’t believe him or brushed him and his paranoia aside. Appealed to political class that rejected him – Did not bullshit but lived in reality

    - **Note:** Embrace reality. Founders are the guardians of the company’s soul. Deep focus is required for success but is becoming more rare. First don’t lose then win.
      He did not have a perception reality gap like other leaders this lead to him looking crazy but being right
- De Gaulle was often alone/ always only going into the field fearlessly with no concern for his life. He would barely sleep when at the front and threw himself directly into the action. Needed to be alone for calm reflection said people who did valuable things did them alone and he refused to quit his will never broke – Never quit the ability to be with your own thoughts in quiet reflection so you can think for yourself. Buffet/Munger/Singleton/ Almost everyone

    - **Note:** The importance of being formidable and never quitting regardless of what happened as well as quiet reflection.
- De Gaulle fled to England knowing little English to lead the French empire despite being a former general stripped of his office. He ripped the most revered general and his mentor baton for giving up and fled to England knowing exactly what he wanted to do with deep clarity and focus that made him stand out in a confusing indecisive time. Strict in what he wants to happen flexible on execution – clear goal with an uncertain path wading bravely into the unknown. Going for broke with no fall back plan. Common theme

    - **Note:** De Gaulle burned the boats and left for England as the strong figure who would lead France out of this tough time. He had a clear plan with high conviction. He was very clear on his plan and relentless. Set a North Star and adjust your plan dynamically to get there
- De Gaulle became an idea not a person of real France and keeping up the fight and at this point de Gaulle the man referred to himself in his own memoirs in the 3rd person. He had out grown himself. Believed he was not defeated. He never folded and eventually he was a rallying cry hundreds first then thousands of French came to England to serve him. He turned away no one who was aligned with his mission a Jewish soldier was turned away by his officer which he over ruled saying this man was French and that’s all he cared about singular focus. – singularly focused on the mission and the power of brand he was a brand.

    - **Note:** De Gaulle was singularly focused on the mission and had nothing other than that in mind. The background of soldiers didn’t matter and he never believed he lost he always kept fighting.
- His disagreeableness and ambition was difficult to deal with for the Brit’s but if he wasn’t he would have surrendered with the rest of France. He was a cold man and an asshole who would listen and adopt the ideas of others if they were better only after fiercely rejecting them and fighting over them. This fierceness was his strength and he was emotionally unavailable. No one knew him as a friend but his idea galvanized people and he needed administrative support but his ideas allowed him to thrive. He was not a democrat but very authoritarian. De Gaulle had the complete support of the people and the us and British tried to weaken de Gaulles power but this gave him the ability to grow and eventually he controlled the French army because they would accept no other leader. He had to conquer adversaries both axis and allied but conquer at every step he did – The allies sided with him and expected him to cowtow to them despite never having shown he would ever do this. Managing people who are volatile but productive you cant expect them to turn it on and off when you want you need to understand who they are and take the best and the worst they have. He also didn’t have friends and waa a semi god. We must go forward whoever stands still falls behind – constant improvement.

    - **Note:** de gaulle was a strong personality who was able to lead others and demanded others follow him by creating a great cult of personality. His nature was unyielding and he was willing to run through a wall for his beliefs. He was fierce and not to be messed with. The brittish thought he could be leveraged but then would yield to them, but formitable people don't do that. This dude was a god but had no friends.
      Dont underestimate people, cult of personality and formidable individuals. Managing volatile personalities. Very high agency indomitable guy.
      He was admired but feared, relentless with his visions, stopping at nothing to achieve them. He was respected for that by other national leaders as well.
