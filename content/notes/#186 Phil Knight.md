  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  I was up before the others, before the birds, before the sun. I drank a cup of coffee, wolfed down a piece of toast, put on my shorts and sweat shirt and laced up my running shoes. Then i slipped quietly out the back door. I stretched my legs, my hamstrings, my lower back, and groaned as i took the first few steps down the cool road into the fog. Why is it always so hard to get started? There were no cars, no people, no signs of life.
  Speaker 1
  I was all alone, the world to myself that foggy morning, that momentous morning in 19 62. I had recently blazed my own trail back home after seven long years away.
  Speaker 2
  It was strange being home again. Strange being lashed again by the daily rains. Stranger still was living again with my parents and twin sisters, sleeping in my childhood bed. Late at night, i'd lie on my back, staring at my college text books, my high school trophies and blue ribbons, thinking, this is me, still on paper. I thought, i'm an adult. I graduated from a good college, university oregon, earned a master's from a top business school stamford. Survived a year long hitch in the us. Army. My resume said i was a learned, accomplished soldier, a 24 year old man in full.
  Speaker 1
  So why, i wondered, why do i still feel like a kid?
  Speaker 2
  I would have found it difficult to say what or who exactly i was or i might be.
  Speaker 1
  Come like all my friends, i wanted to be successful. Unlike my friends, i didn't know what that meant. Money, maybe, wife, kids, house, sure, if i was lucky.
  Speaker 2
  These were the goals i was taught to aspire to. And part of me did aspire to them instinctively.
  Speaker 1
  But deep down, i was searching for something else, something more.
  Speaker 2
  I had an aching sense that our time is short, shorter than we ever know, short as a morning run. And i wanted mine to be meaningful and purposeful and creative and important, above all, different. I wanted to leave a mark on the world. I wanted to win.
  Speaker 1
  No, no, that's not right.
  Speaker 2
  I simply didn't want to lose. And then it happened. As my heart began to thump, as my lungs expanded like the wings of a bird, as the trees turned to greenish blurs, i saw it all before me, exactly what i wanted my life to be. Play. Yes, i thought, that's it.
  Speaker 1
  That's the word, the secret of happiness.
  Speaker 2
  I'd always suspected the essence of beauty or truth, or all that we ever need to know of either, lay somewhere in that moment when the ball is in mid air, when both boxers sense the approach Of the bell, when the runners near the finish line and the crowd rises as one. There's a kind of exuberant clarity in that pulsing half second before winning and losing are decided. I wanted that whatever that was, to be my life, my daily life. At different times i'd fantasized about becoming a great novelist, a great journalist, a great statesman. But the ultimate dream was always to be a great athlete. Sadly, fate had made me good, not great. I'd run a track at oregon, and i'd distinguished myself, but that was that the end. Now, as i began to clip off, one brisk six mile after another, i asked myself, what if there was a way, without being an athlete, to feel what athletes feel, to play all the time instead Of working, or else to enjoy work so much that it becomes essentially the same thing? The world was so overrun with war and pain and sery, the daily grind was so exhausting and often unjust maybe the only answer, i thought, was to find some prodigious, improbable dream That seemed worthy, that seemed fun, that seemed a good fit, and chase it with an athlete's single minded dedication and purpose.
  Speaker 1
  Like it or not, life is a game.
  Speaker 2
  Whoever denies that truth, whoever simp refuses to play, gets left on the side lines. And i didn't want that. More than anything. That was the thing i did not want, which led, as always, to my crazy idea. Maybe, i thought, just maybe, i need to take one more look at my crazy idea. Maybe my crazy idea just might work. Maybe, no, no, i thought, running faster, faster, running as if i were chasing someone and being chased all the same time. It will work. By god, i'll make it work. Kno, maybe's about it. I was suddenly smiling, almost laughing, drenched in sweat, moving as gracefully and effortlessly as i ever had. I saw my crazy idea shining up ahead, and it didn't look all that crazy. It didn't even look like an idea. It looked like a place. It looked like a person, or some life force that existed long before i did, separate from me, but also a part of me, waiting for me, but also hiding from me. That might sound a little high flown, a little crazy, but that's how i felt back then. At 24. I did have a crazy idea. And somehow, despite being dizzy with exessential ancs and fears about the future and doubts about myself, as all young men and women in their mid twenties are, i did decide that the
  Speaker 1
  World is made up of crazy ideas.
  Speaker 2
  History is one long procession of crazy ideas. The things i love most, books, sports, democracy, free enterprise, started as crazy ideas.
  Speaker 1
  So that morning in 19 62, i told myself, let everyone else call your idea crazy. Just keep going. Don't stop. Don't even think about stopping until you get there.
  Speaker 2
  Whatever comes, just don't stop. That's the precocious, prescient, urgent advice i managed to give myself out of the blue, and somehow manage to take half a century later.
  Speaker 1
  I believe it's the best advice, may be the only advice any of us should ever give. ([Time 0:00:52](https://share.snipd.com/snip/070772f6-6bf1-42aa-9789-5006867b1b57))

  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  It was one of my final classes a seminar and anchpinership. I had written a research paper about shoes. And the paper had evolved from a run a mill assignment to an all out obsession. Being a runner, i knew something about running shoes, being a business buff i knew that japanese cameras had made deep cuts into the camera market, which had once been dominated by germans. Thus i argued in my paper that japanese running shoes might do the same thing. The idea interested me, then inspired me, then captivated me. It seemed so obvious, so simple, so potentially huge. I'd spent weeks and weeks on this paper. I'd moved into the library, devoured everything i could find about importing and exporting, about starting a company. I'd given a formal presentation of the paper to my classmates, who rejected with arsuty, who reacted with boredom. No, not one asked a single question. They greeted my passion and intensity with sighs and vacant stares. The professor thought my crazy idea had merit.
  Speaker 1
  He gave me an a. But that was that.
  Speaker 2
  At least that was supposed to be that. I had never rally stopped thinking about that paper.
  Speaker 1
  So two thoughts popped to mind when i read that a first first one was that at least he got an e. If you remember, somewhere back in the one fifties, i covered the tebiography of fred smith, the founder o fedex. His company also started as a term paper, and he got a c. But the second thing i thought of was one of my favorite ideas that i learned from edwin land, the founder of poleroid. Ahi've done, i don't even what, five books, five or six books on on edwin land, up rigt on five or six pot gass ono.
  Speaker 2
  But anyways, he said something was very interesting. And he says, the test of an invention is the power of an inventor to push it through in the face of staunch, not opposition, but indifference in society.
  Speaker 1
  In a way to reduce the thought o. The main point behind edwin land's is that indifference is your enemy. And we saw the same thing in the presentation that pill's giving. They didn't hate the idea, they just didn't care about it at all. So if he goes for that run that changes his life. In 19 62, he's not gary wen to pursue the crazy idea. He doesn't have a lot of money. So he's got to get he's got to get some money. He has this idea. I sok, i'm going to go round the world. I gon to do a trip around the world. While i'm on this trip around the world, i want to stop in japan try to convince some japanese shoe manufacturers to let me resell their product.

- Phil Knight's Management Style and Inner Monologue
  Summary:
  Phil Knight's inner monologue reflects his constant wonder about his purpose in life and the importance of breaking rules to be remembered.
  He emphasizes the significance of documenting thoughts and experiences to prevent forgetting impactful moments. Knight draws inspiration from historical figures like a first-century rabbi and Churchill, mirroring his determination for victory and pride in one's craft.
  His management style focuses on guiding people on what to do rather than how to do it, allowing them to surprise with results.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  He's a master motivator. So he continues on and on.
  Speaker 1
  Bute, there's a saying that mcarthur said that phil constany references as he's building ninke.
  Speaker 2
  He says, of course, he was deeply flawed, but he knew that you were remembered, he said, for the rules you break.
  Speaker 1
  And that's a line hel constantly reference. Throghout the story of building nikey, you remembered for the rules you break.
  Speaker 2
  He's moving on now. He's in he's standing insn in front of a 600 year old buddha, a statue.
  Speaker 1
  And again, i just want to bring yor attention the constant wondering about his purpose in life. What is my life going to be? The fact that he, he does not have the answers. Lyco like everybody, he does not have the answers. He's just wondering about it constantly, standing before its face.
  Speaker 2
  I asked, i asked it, why am i here? What is my purpose?
  Speaker 1
  I waited nothing or else. The silence was my answer. And so just a few more examples of these, these thoughts that he's having. He actually journalled his entire trip around the world, which is why he knows what he was thinking. He talks about regretting, and i'l get to that more later, regretting not doing the same as he was building the company. Because he says, every like you, you have these thoughts that you we're living through them. They're so impactflt the time, you're like, hat, there's no way i'm going to forget it. You're going to forget it. Write it down, documentad it would be advice from phil knight m so at this point he's talking about work and craft and life's purpose.
  Speaker 2
  And he said, why was we work so hard?
  Speaker 1
  I thought, and yet, the first century rabbi not heavngongto tried to pronouce the sky's name, said, our work is the holiest part of us.
  Speaker 2
  All are proud of their craft. God speaks of his work. How much more should man?
  Speaker 1
  Another thought for you, this time he's in italy, and this really is going to echo, because a large part of what drove phil night was his hatred for a detis. And at the time, adetis is a much larger company. And so in this what he standing in frot of the statue of david. And really this is a metaphor for how he saw night nike's fight against goliath, which would be a dedis. I stood before david, shocked at the anger in his eyes. Goliath never had a chance. And this continued. These are not all in saint pae this goes on for a while. It was really fascinating how he drew these parallels from great people in history and applied it to his on his own journey. Now he's in france. I was thinking all the while of patten, don't tell people how to do things.
  Speaker 2
  Tell them what to do and let them surprise you with their results.
  Speaker 1
  That sentence right there, he repeats over in oregon. That is phil knight's management style, don't tell people what to do. Suse, don't tell people how to do things. Tell them what to do and let them surprise you with the results. Ah, now he's in england. I conjured up the great churchill.
  Speaker 2
  You ask, what is our aim?
  Speaker 1
  I can answer in one word.
  Speaker 2
  It is victory. Victory at all costs. Victor inthe spite of all terror. Victory. Without victory, there is no survival. ([Time 0:23:48](https://share.snipd.com/snip/16c5a00e-06db-45e8-bcd3-b5c9daedb549))

  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And so while hou's havet his conversation with dad, his mam is overhearing, and it's not going well. Later in his life, he dedicates a building, because at the point he's writing this book, he's giving away, like a hundred million a year. He's giving away to colleges and all kinds of charities. But he dedicates a building, and the place at the entrance says, mothers are our first coaches. And i think thiswhat what happens next, is part of the inspiration for that. I shouldn't have been too surprised by my mother's next move. When my father accused me of jackassing around casually, she opened her purse and took out seven dollars.
  Speaker 2
  I'd like to purchase one pair, please, she said, loud enough for him to hear. And so he talked about the fact tha, she acknowledged she buys them, but she wears them proudly. It never failed to move me, the sight of her standing at the stove or the kitchen sink, cooking dinner or washing dishes, in a pair of japanese running shoes, size six.
  Speaker 1
  Son, i want to tell you about his early sale strategy, selling hem out of his trunk. So you go to where your customers are, and then he has this idea that belief is irresistibler fantastic. My sail strategy was simple, and i thought rather brilliant.
  Speaker 2
  After being rejected by a couple of sporting goods stores, they would say, what is the world?
  Speaker 1
  The world does not need another track shoe.
  Speaker 2
  I drove all over the pacific northwest to various track meets.
  Speaker 1
  Between races, i'd chat up the coaches, the runners, the fans and show them my wares.
  Speaker 2
  The response was always the same, i couldn't write orders fast enough. Driving back to portland, i'd puzzle over my sudden success at selling i had been unable to sell encyclopaedias, and i despised it to boot. I had been slightly better at selling mutual funds, but i felt dead inside. So why was selling shoes so different?
  Speaker 1
  Because i realized it wasn't selling. I believed in running.
  Speaker 2
  I believed that if peoplet got out and ran a few miles every day, the world would be better place. And i believed these shoes were better to run in. People, sensing my belief, wanted some of that belief for themselves. Belief, i decided, belief is irresistible.
  Speaker 1
  C e society's got a partner. He's got a bank, he's got a product. Then he gets a letter in the mail, and it's a letter from another guy on the east coast saying, hey, he sent s a seasonis a letter saying, hey, i have a contract with anasuka. Stop selling the shoes. And he's like, what is going on here? And this is thiss like the very first of many warning signs.
  Speaker 2
  Thay, if something's mportant to your business, you have to control it.
  Speaker 1
  That's a main lesson that we've larned by setting thehistory f onch pership. He's at the whims of his manufacture, which it's going to take him multiple years to get out from underneath this. And he winds up, they, they try to screw him over, which winds up also, countertutively, being the best ting that ever happened to him.
  Speaker 2
  But he gets this letter, and he thinks everything is over.
  Speaker 1
  And another main theme of this book is the idea of the entriponeal emotional roller coaster.
  Speaker 2
  Mark in dreason has a quote that i think just nails it.
  Speaker 1
  And at the time, he's running a start up with his partner, ben horwitz. And he talks to bennies like, you know what? The best thing about start ups is and bends like what?
  Speaker 2
  And this sentence is perfect. The best thing about start ups you only ever experience two emotions, euphoria and terror. And i find that a lack of sleep enhances them both.
  Speaker 1
  So we're going to see constantly, as we go through this book, these alternating states of euphoria and terror, and nothing in between. So now were in the terror part. Got this letter. Now io's depressed. I went into a deep funk. I became such ouch, such poor company, that my grof and dump me. Each night, i'd sit with my family at dinner, moving my food arond on my plate. Then i'd sit with my father, staring at the t v.
  Speaker 2
  Buck my father said, you look like someone hit you in the back of the head with a twube. I for snap out of it, but i couldn't.
  Speaker 1
  So he takes the drastic step of flying back to japan and trying to get some resolution of this.
  Speaker 2
  The art of competing from track was the art of forgetting.
  Speaker 1
  And i now reminded myself of that fact.
  Speaker 2
  You must forget your limits.
  Speaker 1
  You must forget your doubts, your pain, your past.
  Speaker 2
  You must forget that internal voice screaming, begging, not one more step.
  Speaker 1
  And when it's not possible to forget it, you must negotiate with it.
  Speaker 2
  Yes, you raise some excellent points, but let's keep going.
  Speaker 1
  Ay, see how he repeats that, keep going, don't stop.
  Speaker 2
  Over and over again. Whatever you do, don't stop.
  Speaker 1
  I told myself that i need to sumemon the old, that old skill quickly, or lose.
  Speaker 2
  And i could not bear the thought of losing.
  Speaker 1
  So he's in the hotel in japan the night before his meeting, and we see more terror. Now thirs can be terror, followed immediately by you for it. ([Time 0:39:18](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f24333a3-0574-4c02-b20d-4a6d634ed1fa))

- Influence of Historical Figures on Management Style
  Summary:
  The insight highlights the story of Jeff Johnson, the first full-time employee of a company, who demonstrated immense enthusiasm and commitment by continuously writing lengthy letters to his employer.
  Despite initial concerns about his zealousness, Johnson's passion for running and belief in its transformative power led to his eventual full-time employment. The narrative underscores the importance of hiring individuals driven by a sense of mission rather than solely monetary motives, as Johnson's dedication and vision ultimately contributed to the company's success and growth.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Th, he can be full time employing number one.
  Speaker 1
  And that's jeff johnson, probably the greatest full time, first full time employer you could ever have. He was absolutely obsessed with running the each other. I think they were on the same track team. They went to bumping each other at a track meet. When when phil's trying to sell his his shoes, and eventually he offersa o wan to come work, work for me.
  Speaker 2
  So he says, he wrote right back.
  Speaker 1
  He wrote back right away, accepting the offer. And then the letters didn't stop. On the contrary, they increased in length and number. At first they were two pages, then four.
  Speaker 2
  Then at first they came every few days. Then they came faster and faster, tumbling almost daily through the mail slot like a waterfall. And i wondered what in god's name i had done in hiring the sky. I liked his energy, of course, and it was hard to find it was hard to fault his enthusiasm. But i began to worry that he might have too much of each with the twentieth letter or the 20 fifth, i began to worry that the man might be unhinged. I wondered if he was ever going to run out of things he urgently needed to tell me or ask me. I wondered if he was ever going to run out of stamps. Every time a thought crossed johnson's mind, seemingly he wrote it down and stuck it in an envelope.
  Speaker 1
  He wrote to tell me how many tigers he'd sold that week. He so extremely good at what he does, though.
  Speaker 2
  He wrote to tell me how many tigers he'd sold that day. He wrote to tell me who warned tigers at which high school meet and what place they finished. He wrote to suggest that we open a new a store in los angeles. He wrote to tell me that he was considered placing ads in running magazines. And what did i think? He wrote to inform me that he had placed those ads in running magazines. And the response was good. He wrote to ask me why i hadn't answered any of his previous letters. He wrote to plead for encouragement. He wrote to complain that i hadn't responded to the previous plea for encouragement. I always meant to answer johnson's letters, but before i got around to it, there was always another one waiting. He wrote sayth t he'd quit his job. He'd always hated it. John he wrote again that now he understood himself and his destiny, social work, wasn't it? He was put on this earth to fix people's problems.
  Speaker 1
  I should shink he wasn't put on this earth to fix people's problems. He preferred to focus on their feet. And this is the most important part of this entire section that i'm reading to you.
  Speaker 2
  In his heart of hearts, johnson believed that runners are god's chose, that running done right, in the correct spirit and with the proper form is a mystical exercise no less than meditation
  Speaker 1
  Or prayer. And thus he felt called to help runners reach the nivana. I'm going to pause in the middle of this. What did we learn from jeff basos? You can be a mission you can, you can be a missionary or a mercenary.
  Speaker 2
  And you can hire is missionaries or mercenaries.
  Speaker 1
  Always pick the missionaries. John is a missionary. Ihad been around runners all much of my life, but this kind of dewy romanticism was something i had never encountered before. Not even bowrman was as pious about the sport as blue ribbon's part time employee number two. Part time employe number one is his sister, phil, the phillnight's sister, helping u with answering letters and adman work.
  Speaker 2
  In fact, in 19 65, this was really surprising to me. In fact, in 19 65, running wasn't evenapo it was. It wasn't popular. It wasn't unpopular. It just was. To go out for a three mile run was something weirdos did, presumably to burn off manic energy.
  Speaker 1
  Running for pleasure, running for exercise, running for dorfins, running to live better and longer.
  Speaker 2
  These things were unheard of at the time. People often went out of their way to mock runners. Drivers would crazy to me. Drivers would slow down and honk their horns. Get a horse, they'd yell, throwing a beer or soda at the runner's head, johnson had been drenched by many a pepsy. He wanted to change all this. Above all, johnson wanted to make a living doing it, which was next to impossible in 19 65, in me, in blue ribbon. He thought he saw a way.
  Speaker 1
  I did everything i could to discourage johnson from thinking like this.
  Speaker 2
  At every turn, i try to dampen his ent asm for me and my company. Besides not writing back, i never phoned, never visited, never invited him to oregon. I also never missed an opportunity to tell him the unvarnished truth, though our growth has been good, i owe the bank 11 thousand dollars. Cash flow is negative. He wrote back immediately asking if he could work for me full time. I shook my head. I tell the man, blue ribbon is sinking like the titanic, and here onds by begging for a berth in first class.
  Speaker 1
  So in the late, in the late summer of 19 65, i wrote and accepted johnson's offer to become the first full time employee of blue ribbon. ([Time 0:46:05](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6ffa97a9-0603-4e00-9a6f-e3b222e186cc))

- Early Days of Nike: From Faking It to Making It
  Key takeaways:
  - The early days of Nike were tenuous, just like the early days of any company.
  - Nike did not have money even five years into the business.
  - Early employees of Nike included track stars and individuals with disabilities.
  - The founder had to borrow money for lunch from an employee.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Was i maybe modelling all the men i admired? At the time, i was reading everything i could get on my hands, i could get my hands on about generals, samurai, along with the biographies of my three main heroes, churchill, kennedy And tolstoy. I had no love of violence, but i was fascinated by leader, or lack thereof, under extreme conditions. War is the most extreme of conditions. Business has its warlike parallels. Some onea someone once said that business is war withou the bullets. And i tended to agree. I wasn't that unique. Throughout history, men have looked to the warrior for a model of hemingway's cardinal virtue, which he's going to call pressurized grace, of grace under pressure. One lesson i took from all my home schooling about heroes was that they didn't say much. None was a blabber mouth. None micro managed.
  Speaker 1
  Don't tell people how to do things. Tell them what to do and let them surprise you with their results. Heasging t apply this tot his management of johnson. So i didn't answer johnson, and i didn't pester him having told him what to do. I hoped that he would surprise me. And he wouldely surprise him. One of the ideas we just went through this a caesar writs, august scaffier did what johnson's doing here, and so did a ise sharp, founder of four seasons. This is the freshness of my mind, this idea that you constantly keep a catalogue of customer behavior. Each knew. This is what johnson's doing. Each new customer got his own index card. And each index card contained the customer's personal information, shoe size and shoe preferences. This data base enabled johnson to keep in touch with his customers at all times and to keep them all feeling special. He sent them christmas cards. He sent them birthday cards. He sent them notes of congratulations after they completed a big race or marathon.
  Speaker 2
  Whenever i got a letter from johnson, i knew it was one of the dozens he'd carried down to the mail box that day. He had hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of customer correspondents all along the spectrum of humanity, from high school track stars to octogenarian week end joggers. Many, upon pulling yet another johnson letterfrom their mail boxes must have thought the same thing i did. Where does the guy find the time? Most wrote him back. They'd tell him about their lives, their troubles, their injuries. And johnson would lavishly console sympathize and advise, especially about injuries.
  Speaker 1
  Few in the 19 sixties knew the first thing about running injuries, or sports ind their injuries in generals.
  Speaker 2
  And so johnson's letters were often filled with information that it was impossible to find anywhere else. Johnson then began aggregating customer feedback, using it to create new designs, sketches. One man, for instance, complained that tigers didn't have enough cushion. He wanted to run tho boston marthom, but didn't think the shoe would last for 26 miles.
  Speaker 1
  So this is the level of detail really thit's the main point of us.
  Speaker 2
  Like how if you love what you do, you're going to care, not onlyu oingto care about it more than anybody else, as hard for peple can be with you, but you're going to be obsess by t detail.
  Speaker 1
  So johnson hired a local cobbler to graft rubber shoes from a pair of shower shoes into a pair of nike, or shoink nike into a pair of tiger flats.
  Speaker 2
  Voila, johnson's frankenstein flat head space age, full length mid sole cushioning, which is to day standard.
  Speaker 1
  But the time didn't exists. Johnson's customer posted a personal best in boston. So johnson winds up convincing phil to to open the very first showroom he runs. Johnson runs it an saint amonica. And section is going to remind me about a quote from steve jobs, which i get to in one second. In all the world, there'd never been such a sanctuary for runners, a place that didn't just sell them shoes, but celebrated them and their shoes.
  Speaker 2
  Johnson, the aspiring colt leader of runners, finally had his church.
  Speaker 1
  Services were monday through saturday, nine to six.
  Speaker 2
  There's a great speech is available on you two.
  Speaker 1
  It's steve jobs ight after he came back to applenint seven. And he's onvailing. Here's the crazy ones. He's talking about ow marketing, excommunication. Are you need it's a busy world. We have a limited time to tell people what to tell people, like what the important thing is about us and our company, right? And he, he talks about the greatest marketing company of all time is nikes. Like, they don't even their ads don't talk about their product. They celebrate great athletes. So he says, nikes ads don't talk about their products. They lebrate great athletes. We are going to do the same. ([Time 0:52:13](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d206400e-5988-4c93-b03b-92a2e0b2f7e0))

- The Early Days of Microsoft and Building a Business
  Summary:
  The speaker reflects on their early days at Microsoft, where they balanced a day job at Price Waterhouse with building Blue Ribbon.
  Despite working long hours, they were content dedicating all their time to their passion. The speaker prioritized focusing on the most important task, finding what feels like play but looks like work to others, and striving to be themselves full-time.
  Despite facing criticism for leaving their day job to focus on Blue Ribbon, the speaker followed their inner scorecard and felt ready to explore where their path would lead.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  When i wasn't at price water house, this is where he's a accounting making the rent, i'd be at blue ribbon and vice versa. I could shower at the jim, but i told myself that living in your office is the act of a crazy person. And then i got a letter from johnson saying that he was living in his new office.
  Speaker 1
  Oh, graeso, let me give you a, there's a lot happening on this page. A, let me give you an up date to what his schedule is like. This is now five years into the company. I was putting in six days a week at price water house, spending early mornings and late nights and all week ends and vacations at blue ribbon. No friends, no exercise, no social life, and wholly content.
  Speaker 2
  My life was out of balance, sure, but i didn't care. In fact, i wanted even more in balance, or a different kind of a balance. I wanted it to dedicate every minute, every day to blue ribbon.
  Speaker 1
  Ih'd never been acasolet me. M going to read the whole section. I'll finish reading it, and then ill tell you mymy interpretation. I'd never, ih'd never been a moto tasker, and i didn't see any reason to start now.
  Speaker 2
  I wanted to be present always. I wanted to focus constantly on the one task that really mattered. If my life was to be all work and no play, i wanted my work to be play. I wanted to quit price water house. Not that i hated it, it just wasn't me. I wanted what everyone wants, to be me full time. But it wasn't possible. Blue ribbon simply couldn't support me. Though the company was on track to double sales for a fifth straight year, it still couldn't justify a salary for its co founder. So i decided to compromise, find a different day job, one that would pay my bills, but requi fewer hours, leaving me more time to my passion.
  Speaker 1
  This is when he decides to become a a tit instead of being an accountant, to teach accounting at, i think, portland state universities. Before i move on to the next page, i read my notes to you. So many lessons, and just a few paragraphs, find what you love to do and no one can keep up. Wa, i always think of the way to find that is ah. This is a quote from neville, nevl neval ravacan. And he says, what feels like play to you, but looks like work to others. Another note, no multi tasking. Focus on the most important task. And then the end goal should be to be yourself full time. Which i love that sentence. I wanted what everyone wants, to be, me full time. Ahm. So he tells his dad this decision, and we're going to see, you know, he's differece between inner score card and outer score card. He stared, i'd i'm sorry. This is his boss first. His boss and his dad re act the same way. So he tells him, i'm quitting.
  Speaker 2
  He stared, i'd gone off. Scrip. Way off. Why the hell would you do something like that?
  Speaker 1
  I then told my father. I he was pretty pissed i was still jackassing around with shoes.
  Speaker 2
  He said teaching at portland state was downright disrespectul disrespectable.
  Speaker 1
  What am i going to tell my friends? So out uter score card, this is, this is how phil thought about this.
  Speaker 2
  I was following a path that felt like my path, and though i wasn't sure where it would lead, i was ready to find out. Inner score card, and he's constantly comparing and contrasting the way he felt with the way outsiders did to outsiders. It isno not nothing he's doing is making sense. But his discompany was his sole i confess. ([Time 1:01:15](https://share.snipd.com/snip/887b649d-d836-4cff-98c8-d22f3e972a57))

- Contract Renewal and Uncertainty
  Summary:
  The founder faces self-doubt and emotional turmoil as he transitions to working full-time for his company, dealing with the pressure of success and the need to balance personal life.
  He struggles to remember precious moments and realizes the importance of documenting life. Contract renewals bring a mix of euphoria and terror, as he is relieved to secure new contracts but anxious about the uncertainty and lack of control over his business's future.
  Ultimately, getting fired from a contract leads him to take bold risks that result in significant personal and professional growth, similar to experiences shared by successful entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  I decided that blue ribbon was now doing well enough to justify a salary for its founder. Right before my 30 first birthday, i made the bullm the bold move. So he quits his teaching job, and i went full time at my company. And just pause tond think about that.
  Speaker 1
  How many people would have given up before that? He's spending every free minte's working full time, every free minute he has on his business for seven years before he can work on a full time that's amazing and inspiring. Right? Let's go to a inside of his personality.
  Speaker 2
  He's a loaner and an introvert, that success was making his company survive. And he's super competitive.
  Speaker 1
  So he's talking about he got married. His wife's understanding who he is. She was learning that i spent a fair portion of each day lost in my own thoughts, tumbling down mental worm holes, trying to solve some problem or construct some plan. I often didn't hear what she said, and if i did hear i didn't remember later, minutes later.
  Speaker 2
  She was learning that i was absent minded, that i would drive to the grocery store and come home empty handed, without the one item she asked me to buy, because all the way there and all The way back, i'd been puzzling over the latest bank crisis or the most recent shipping delay. She was learning that i didn't like to lose at anything, that losing, for me, was a special form of agony. I was determined to win.
  Speaker 1
  And this time, even thoughe' just started working theire full time, i'm not skipping over anything, he is riddled with self doubt and again, oscillating to e back between euphoria And terror. And this is going to work.
  Speaker 2
  Oh my god, this is the stupidest thing ever. Oh my god, is the best idea ever.
  Speaker 1
  No, i'm really crazy.
  Speaker 2
  It's thisontripaner, emotional roller coster that is present in all these biographies. They all have periods of, iiten, intense self doubt. Was it even feasible to run a start up company while starting a family? Should i go back to accounting or teaching or something more stable? Leaning back every night in my recliner, i would stare at the ceiling. I tried to settle myself. I told myself, life is growth. You grow or you die.
  Speaker 1
  And so why is he going crazy at this particular moment? Because the bank is about to con off he has to put up his house as collateral. An also interesting point that i think is really instructive on human nature is the things that we work hardest for, the things that we desire the most, the things that we're loing to Ost et to sacrifice the most for, are also the things that we get the most joy from. And this is just great writing. This is what i mentioned earlier about documenting your life, that you'll tink yu'll remember everything, but you won't.
  Speaker 2
  So he says, in fantastic, fantastic riting here, i struggle to remember i close my eyes and think back.
  Speaker 1
  But so many precious moments from those nights are gone forever.
  Speaker 2
  Numberless conversations, breathless laughing fits, declarations, revelations, confidences, they 've all fallen into the sofa cushions of time. I remember only that we always sat up half the night cataloguing the past, mapping out the future. I remember that we took turns describing what our little company was and what it might be and what it must never be.
  Speaker 1
  How i wish on just one of those nights i'd had a tape recorder or kept a journal. So now we go back to another thing that just keeps repeating. O novergan every few years, his contract's up. He's got to figure out, ok am i am i going to get the contract? Ino? Like spent built up this entire company, but i'm still selling other people's products. And so this is euphoria at a contract renewal followed by terror.
  Speaker 2
  I was relieved to have a new contract, but i returned to oregon feeling troubled, anxious, more so at any time in the last eight years. Sure my brief case had held, or held at grantee that onesuca would supply me with shoes for the next three years.
  Speaker 1
  But why were they using to extend beyond three? I was sceptical, but there was nothing i could do. I was at their mercy. I had no leverage. And so getting fired, which is esentially what they do, what he what happenst they're trying to cancel his contract and and sign contracts with other retailers. Wines up being, he doesn't knowie this time forces him to go all in on nake, which one of the best things that ever happened to him. Reminds me of the famous steve job's commencement address. He says, i didn't see it then, but it turned out getting fired from apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. Phil knight and c jobbs are going to have the same experience, or a similar experience, since i guess he didn't get fired from the company. Phil didn't get fired from the cmpanye founded the entire history, early history, of nike. ([Time 1:06:09](https://share.snipd.com/snip/915f2875-072a-4c56-b9fe-205bbcb85a52))

- The Impact of Lawsuit on Phil Knight
  Summary:
  The lawsuit against the manufacturer led Phil Knight to see the birth of Nike as a pivotal moment.
  He rallied his team to embrace the challenge, viewing it as an opportunity for independence and success. Knight emphasized the importance of facing the crisis as a liberation and an independence day, leading the team to focus on their own brand and ideas.
  Despite the tough road ahead, Knight believed they knew the terrain and could win the war, envisioning great success on the other side of victory.
  Inspired by an athlete's total effort in a race, Knight learned that total effort in any human endeavor wins people's hearts.
  He saw the race as a lesson to apply to his company, emphasizing the importance of competition as if their lives depended on it, mirroring the passion and determination of the athlete. Knight's determination and commitment to success embody the essence of going after one's goals as if one's life depends on it, as demonstrated by the athlete in the race.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Dedalus was a skilful architect and craftsman, seen as a symbol of wisdom, knowledge and power. And so they want him getting cut off by their manufacturer, the they sue their manufacturer in the united states.
  Speaker 1
  The manufacturer suits them japan.
  Speaker 2
  And really, this, this might be my favorite part of the book. Might be it's the birth of nike. And what he does here is just, it's just perfect. So he's calling on all hands meeting, and he says a they were all about therewe about 30 people there. I expected to be nervous. They expected me to be nervous on any different day. And under any other circumstances, i would have been.
  Speaker 1
  For some reason. However, i felt weirdly at peace.
  Speaker 2
  I laid out the situation we faced. We've come, folks, to a cross roads yesterday. Our main supplier cut us off.
  Speaker 1
  I let that sink in.
  Speaker 2
  I watched everyone's jaw drop. We're completely on our own. We're set adrift.
  Speaker 1
  We have this new line, nike, and that's all we've got. I looked down at the table.
  Speaker 2
  Everyone was sinking, slumping. I loked at johnson. He was staring at the papers before him, and there was something in his face, some quality i had never seen there before, surrender. Like everyone else in the room he was giving the nation's economy was in the tank. Our recession was under way.
  Speaker 1
  Gas lines, political gridlock rising on employment.
  Speaker 2
  Nixon being nixon, viet nam. It seemed like the end times. Everyone in the room had already been worrying about how they were goin to make rent, pay their light bill.
  Speaker 1
  And now this.
  Speaker 2
  I cleared my throat. So in other words, what i'm trying to say, we've got them right where we want them.
  Speaker 1
  Johnson lifted his eyes. Everyone around their table, around the table, lifted their eyes.
  Speaker 2
  They sat up straighter, straighter. This is the moment we've been waiting for, our moment. No more selling someone else's brand, no one working for someone else. They've been holding us back for years, their late deliveries, their mixed up orders, their refusal to hear and implement our desin itis. Who among us isn't sick of dealing with all that? It's time we faced facts. If we're going to succeed or fail, we should do it on our own terms, with our own ideas, our own brand. We posted two million in sales last year, none of which had anything to do with the manufacture. That number was a testament to our own ingenuity and hard work. Let's not look at this as a crisis. Let's look at this as our liber ration, our independence day. Yes, it's going to be tough. I won't lie to you. We're definitely going to war. But we know the turrain.
  Speaker 1
  And that's one reason i feel in my heart this is a war we can win. And if we win it, when we win it, i see great things for us on the other side of victory.
  Speaker 2
  We're still alive, people. We are still alive.
  Speaker 1
  They start an make one of the first athletes they actually endorse is this guiding pre he was held all the records at the time he went of, dying in a car accident when he's 24 years old a and At the time of his death, he held like almost every single record in his sport. And he's watching him run, and he's drawing a lessons from a race that he's goig to apply to his own his own companys.
  Speaker 2
  He says, no matter the sport, no matter the human endeavor, total effort will win people's hearts. Pree reached down. He found another level. We saw him do it. He opened up a yard lead, then two and then five. I saw the person in second grimace. He knew that he could not, would not catch pree. I told myself, don't forget this. Do not forget i told myself, there was much to be learned from such a display of passion, whether you were running a mile or a company. I knew that race was going to be a part of me, would forever be a part of me. In our coming battles, we would be like pre. We compete as if our lives depended on it, because they did not.
  Speaker 1
  Remind me this line from this random you two vidia that i heard one time, forgot, and i don oy know who the speaker is, but he says, find out what it is you want, and go after it as if your life Depends on it. Why?
  Speaker 2
  Because it does.
  Speaker 1
  And we're seeing that manifested and pre and in phil knight here, ([Time 1:20:21](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f686e964-2dbe-4a47-aec2-490a6e859bce))

- Entrepreneurial Challenges and the Pursuit of Success
  Summary:
  Despite facing a $400,000 judgment where his attorney took half, Phil Knight's focus remained on reinvesting every dollar to sell more shoes, highlighting his commitment to growth and sales.
  Recruiting individuals was about creating a brand and a culture, fighting against conformity and striving to sell an idea and a spirit. Knight's struggles were evident, even ten years into his business at 36 years old, portraying a relentless determination to persevere despite financial challenges and the importance of not giving up as there is still time for success.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I want to say it's 400 thousand dollar judgment. His attorney gets half of that. So he's talking to his attorney, says, i asked him what he was going to do with all that loot. I forget what he said. With ours blue ribbon wic they're still called blue ribbon. They don't, i don't think they re name themselves until right before they appeal. But they're only selling nike. At this time, with ours blue ribbon, would simply leverage the bank into greater barring, more shoes on the water. And that is phil knight in one paragraph this entire book, sell more shoes. That's his mo he does not he's constantly reinvesting every single dollar he has into getting more shoes and then selling them. So he winds up recruiting one of, he liked one of the attorneysthat workedin this case so much he recruited him to be the first inhouse council. And he's talking to them about being one of us.
  Speaker 2
  And really his description, his pitch to to cruit this guy is really tells us how he views himself, an ninke, which is why i'm reading t to you're one of us, i said, one of us. He knew what those words meant. We were the kind of people wh who simply couldn't put up with corporate nonsense. We were the kind of people who wanted our work to be play, but meaningful play. We were trying to slay goliath. At heart, he was an utter david. So talking about the guise, recruiting news of david. So are we? We're trying to create a brand, i said, but also a culture. We were fighting against conformity, against boringness, against drudgery. More than a product, we were trying to sell an idea, a spirit. I don't know if i ever fully understand whoeif i ever fully understood who we were and what we were doing, until i heard myself saying it all that day. I ust want to read one paragraph to you. He's going to look for his own factories, and he's with his troop.
  Speaker 1
  One of his true friends has gatng him, cale, the guy that put up the ten thousand dollars, and they tring to run a car. And says, the clerk at the rental car company declined my credit card.
  Speaker 2
  Talk about dead beat. I couldn't bring myself to look cale in the eye. Here we were a dozen years out of stamford, and while he was an eminently successful business man, i was still struggling to keep my head above water.
  Speaker 1
  He had known i was struggling, but now he knew exactly how much. So think about that. He is he's ten years into his business. It's still tenuous. He's still running out of money all the time.
  Speaker 2
  He's 36 years old. Phil knight is 36 years old when this is happening. And that's important for two reasons.
  Speaker 1
  One's just another illustration that most people would have given up by now. And two, you still time. You still have time. ([Time 1:28:46](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7a4fcb56-c89b-4f23-b412-59fe83266074))

- Exploring Regrets and Life Inventory in Biography and Autobiography
  Key takeaways:
  - It is more important to be determined than smart for founders of companies.
  - Creating, contributing, and daring to improve are key aspects of great businesses.
  - Making others happier, healthier, safer, or better contributes to the grand human drama.
  - Participating fully in the lives of others through business is a noble pursuit.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And i was listening to paul graham, the founder of y comminator talkone one time. And the vitio is on youtube. I think it's caled why commonator podcast, a conversation with paul graham, if if i'm not mistaken. But he was asked ta question like, what is more important an over all success like u a companys, for the founders, it more important to be a determined or smart?
  Speaker 2
  And his answer to this was fascinating. It turns out it is much more important to be determined than smart.
  Speaker 1
  If you imagine this hypothetical person that is 100 out of 100 for smart and 100 out of 100 for determination, and then you start taking away determination, it doesn't take very long
  Speaker 2
  Until you have this ineffectual, but brilliant person. Whereas you take someone who is super determined and you take away smartness, eventually you get to a guy who owns a lot of taxi medallions or a trash hauling business, but he's still Rich.
  Speaker 1
  And super determined is exactly how wold describe fill night. And we're edging closer to the ipo, which is the end of the book. And this is just perfect.
  Speaker 2
  I redefined winning, expanded it beyond my original definition of losing, of merely staying alive.
  Speaker 1
  That was no longer enough to sustain me or my company.
  Speaker 2
  We wanted, as all great businesses do, to create, to contribute, and we dared to say so aloud. When you make something, when you improve something, when you deliver something, when you add some new thing or service to the lives of strangers, making them happier or healthier Or safer or better, and when do it all crisply and efficiently, smartly, the way everything should be done, but so seldom is, you're participating more fully in the whole grand human
  Speaker 1
  Drama.
  Speaker 2
  More than simply alive, you're helping others to live more fully. And if that's business, all right, call me a business man.
  Speaker 1
  Maybe it'll grow on me so they realize there's no more putting theipo that were always going to be a constant, a precarious financial position. I were interesting enough, which always blosed my mind. I knew this, i learned this when i read the book the first time, but being reminded of it always blosed my mind.

  Speaker 1
  And again, more, more, great writing for a long this is the night of the ipeo a. It happened earlye in the day. Now es at night. And then werg one the next morning.
  Speaker 2
  For a long time we lay in the dark. It wasn't over. Far from it.
  Speaker 1
  The first part, i told myself, is behind us.
  Speaker 2
  But it's only the first part. I asked myself, what are you feeling? It wasn't joy. It wasn't relief. If i felt anything, it was regret. Good god, i thought, yes, regret, because i honestly wished i could do it all over again. I fell asleep for a few hours.
  Speaker 1
  When i woke up, it was cold and rainy. I went to the window.
  Speaker 2
  The world was the same as it had been the day before, as it had always been. Nothing had changed, least of all me.
  Speaker 1
  And yet i was worth a hundred and 78 million dollars.
  Speaker 2
  I showered, ate breakfast, drove to work.
  Speaker 1
  I was at my desk before anyone else. So one of the benefits of reading biography and autobiography is the fact that yet we're going to get a lot of ideas. There's no emy. He worked on nike for forty years.
  Speaker 2
  It's impossible not to come up with good ideas from that rate.
  Speaker 1
  But i would argue, more important than the good ideas that we copy from these founders, and these people live remarkable lives, is avoiding the regrets they have. And if it's not more valuable, it's just as valuable. And some regrets you just have to learn to deal with, because there's no way to avoid them.
  Speaker 2
  So what i want to close on is the fact that the book ends, the last chapters him at the age of his book, right?
  Speaker 1
  So po ends now, it's past fourar 35 years in his life, and he's in his seventies, and he's going through taking an inventory of his life, which is so, so valuable, beause there's a lot of Knowledge and regrets at the end of a life. Ah, and so what happens is he's coming up with like, what i want? Like, what's ahead of me? What's he was just watch this movie, the bucket list, and he talks about it lot, actually, and he couldn't come up what he wanted to do.
  Speaker 2
  And the book ends with him getting the idea to write the book.
  Speaker 1
  And again, just fantastic writing. And here's where we'll close.
  Speaker 2
  I think about the few things i want to do. It's not so much things i want to do as things i'd like to say. And maybe unsay. It might be nice to tell the story of nike. Everyone else has told the story, or tried to, but they always get half the facts, if that and none spirit. I might start the story or end it with regrets, the hundreds, maybe thousands, of bad decisions.
  Speaker 1
  Of course, above all, i regret not spending more time with my sons.
  Speaker 2
  Maybe if i had, i could have solved the incrypted code of matthew knight. And yet, i know that this regret clashes with my secret regret that i can't do it all over again. God, how i wish i could relive the whole thing. Short of that, i'd like to share the experience, the ups and downs, so that some young man or woman somewhere going through the same trials and ordeals might be inspired or comforted Or warned. Some young entripeneur, maybe some athlete or painter or novelist, might press it's all the same drive, the same dream.
  Speaker 1
  It would be nice to help them avoid the typical discouragements, i'd tell them to hit paws, think long and hard about how they want to spend their time and with whom they want to spend it For the next forty years.
  Speaker 2
  I'd tell men and women in their mid twenties not to settle for a job or a profession or even a career. Seek a calling, even if you don't know what that means. Seek it. If you're following your calling, the fatigue will be easier to bear. The disappointments will be fuel the hies will be like nothing you've ever felt. I'd like to warn the best of them, the iconoclasts, the innovators, the rebels, that they will always have bull's eyes on their backs. The better they et, the bigger the bull's eye.
  Speaker 1
  It's not one man's opinion, it's the law of nature.
  Speaker 2
  Entrepeners have always been outgunned, outnumbered. They've always fought uphill. And those who urge ontrepeners to never give up charlatans, sometimes you have to give up. Sometimes knowing when to give up, when to try something else, is genius. Giving up doesn't mean stopping.
  Speaker 1
  Don't ever stop. And that is where i'll leave it. For the full story read the book. If you want to buy the book using the lingtons an the show notes on your podcast player, you'llbe supporting the podcast at the same time. That has a hundred and 86 books down, one thousand ago. And i'll talk to you again soon. ([Time 1:38:44](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b339c2bb-7c80-406b-9e22-0ca90cd8a5e8))
