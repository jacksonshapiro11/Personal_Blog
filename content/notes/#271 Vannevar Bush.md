  So what Izzy did, he's like, okay, we're in a temporary pullback, we're in a temporary recession. I'm still spending average and to build up the advertising and the brand awareness of the Four Seasons brand. This was the result. So we didn't cut our ad budget. In fact, we raised it to gain brand recognition and which continued advertising sustains. And so all of these thoughts are tied into repetition is persuasive. What T.G.S. Is doing is they're doing exactly that line at the end with what Izzy just said, the continued advertising sustains. That is a smart move by the founders. If you want to see all the services that T.G.S. Offers, just go to tegus.com it's T-E-G-U-S.com. You can see for yourself and you can start a free trial. Stick around to the end of this episode. And I'm going to tell you this text message conversation about Enzo Ferrari that I had with the founder Michael. One of my favorite things about making this podcast is that I get to talk to so many founders. A lot of those founders are dead. So I have one side of conversations in the form of reading their autobiographies or their biographies. But in addition to that, because so many different entrepreneurs and founders listen to the podcast, I get to meet and talk to founders still building companies today. And a reoccurring theme on these conversations, a lot of these conversations I have with founders is that a large part of your life is actually searching for your life's work. There, a lot of them are looking for something that is uniquely them that they can do forever. And in almost every single case, that means starting more than one company.

    - **Note:** Bush believed in the individual capacity for greatness. Contratian skeptisc of easy solutions but able to solve tough problems without a compass. He was worried about beuracracy and the world trending toward mass mediocrity. Wanted more emergence and chosen life paths. The engineers were a cross disciplinary polymaths that took from different disciplines to solve problems. Believed in entrepreneurial culture when the world was trending toward big business. Bush’s dad told him to be greatful for what he had and not to want what he lacked. Bush would take extreme ownership if there was any doubt he should do something he would do it until someone told him not to. Fiercely independent and a budding marverick.

  Bush saw the engineer as a pragmatic polymath, and he's going to describe here what that means. The engineer, he once wrote, was not a physicist, a businessman, or an inventor, but someone who would acquire some of the skills and knowledge of each of these and be capable of successfully Developing and applying new devices on the grand scale. And that's important to you and I, because he saw entrepreneurs as the people to organize these inputs and to convert the inputs into an actual product, practical product that could Be used by other people. This realization that the engineer was the engine of the 20th century capitalism qualified Bush as the godfather of high technology, and a leading proponent of industrial vitality Through innovation. He co-founded one company and inspired many others that formed the nucleus of the route 128 high tech cluster near Boston at this time in American history. Bush's keen appreciation on the value of entrepreneurs made him a lonely advocate for economic dynamism when most economists welcomed the concurrent rise of big business and big Government. That's an important point to pause on. He's having these views. These views are completely opposite. He's having these views in 1950. It's completely opposite to the world that he's living in, and it's why the author at the very beginning called him a contrarian. He was among the few who realized the curative power of new ventures, the best way to limit monopoly, economic power he insisted, was to the advent of small new industrial units, what We call startups today.

    - **Note:** He read early whaling books and realized that the great captains were autocratic. Took charge in the situation. Realized invention was the only way to maintain his independence. He started working at a radio company after school and didn’t listen to anyone generally just a maverick through and through. He was told he needed 2 years to graduate he tried to do it in 6 months. Bush work with radio led him to founding his radio company Raytheon. His first job was about bringing down the price of radio and domesticated it making it cheap and easy to use. Steve Jobs use this pitch for Apple when he domesticated the computer. When you can simplify complexity you create a market.
- Standing Up to Bullies and Hero Worship
  Key takeaways:
  - Standing up to bullies is important
  - Pushing back against people who try to bully or enforce their will is necessary to gain their respect
  - Don't take mistreatment lying down
  - Bush admired and worshipped his father as his only hero
  - Despite their different life paths, Bush and his father shared similar perspectives and personalities

  Speaker 1
  Okay, I want to switch to the next page. This goes back to, I just love Bush's personality. I like the fact that he likes to fight, that he won't back down. And he knows that it's important because you're going to have throughout your entire life, you're going to have people to try to bully or try to enforce their will on you. And those kind of people tend to only respect people that actually push back. So this guy Jackson runs the electrical engineering department at MIT, technically Bush works for him. And so the main theme of this paragraph is that you have to stand up to bullies. He says, I remember one day, Jackson told me that he didn't like the way I was running a research lab. Bush said, I told him, if you don't like it, you can stick it up your rear end. We parted on those kind words. And I came home and told my wife, well, I guess we're all through at MIT. Where would you like to go next? Maybe I can go out to Caltech. Do you want to go out to California? I asked her. The next day I went in and met Jackson and you'd never know anything had happened. We walked down the corridor together and you think that we were old buddies. But if you took it lying down, you'd get it in the neck. So actually maybe that's a better punch line of that paragraph. Don't take it lying down. And then this is Bush on his father's death. So it says with Perry's death, Bush lost his only hero. He had revered his father in a way that can only be defined as hero worship. While Bush had followed a vastly different path in life than his father, they had shared an outlook and a personality. ([Time 0:28:11](https://share.snipd.com/snip/73023d67-13a9-4fc8-ab8e-16fe0e5b83a6))
    - **Note:** Don’t take it lying down from bully’s reflect strength with strength or you’re fucked. His dad died and was his personal hero. Bush had bouts of anxiety and depression and this is normal in treason he was able to use hobby’s to take a load off when needed. Justify the space you optimize. Lifelong learning brains are wealth and the world is going to be shaped by the future of technology so we might as well embrace it. Discipline must be self applied or it would be externally imposed. Shunned collectivism for the power of man. Power of joy pursuit of self mastery and meeting challenges with a smile and joke was his personal philosophy. Romance in adversity and solace in hard work activity was his antidote to doubt and the avenue to exestential satisfaction. Believed universities were too narrow and mass producing mediocrity students become autonomotons. Specialization is bad we need cross disciplinary

  One most unfortunate product is the type of engineer who does not realize that in order to apply the fruits of science for the benefit of mankind, he must not only grasp the principles Of science but he also know the needs and aspirations, the possibilities and the frailties of those whom he would serve. In other words, he's got to know the nature of humans. Another way to think about Bush is the fact that he's an evangelist for entrepreneurship, for inventing, for learning, and that he couldn't help himself. He would invent for fun. Bush was an irrepressible inventor while an astute manager of research teams. He often pursued his grandest intuitions alone. For him, inventing was a calling, a way of life. Inventing was a game. He was good at it and it relaxed and amused him. No matter how tight a schedule, Bush never stayed away for long from his own experiments. He would find sheer pleasure in tinkering. And then of his own experience, he realizes the need to develop some kind of tool for thought and what he's going to describe here. So he, what I'm about to read to you here, he's thinking about this in the 1930s. He's going to describe the way you and I use personal computers today. He mused about ways to automate the activity of thinking itself. ([Time 0:37:21](https://share.snipd.com/snip/62973729-77d7-4516-bdc5-a37579eacfe0))
    - **Note:** Bush wanted to build and the intersection of science and technology and was always tinkering. Inventing was a calling. Saw the future of computing with human computer symbiosis. He became the coordinator between government accodemic and industry. This was his idea and he did this pre war he then moved to dc he didn’t want to he thought it was the right thing to do. He saw the future and positioned himself in it. He moved to dc because he felt obligated to make a difference bush the world will be ruled by those who can apply science. He likes to fight and when Lindbergh the Germans were too far ahead of the Americans he said good and started tinkering believing with the right focus they could surpass them.

  To respect FDR even though he did not agree with his policies he says Roosevelt wanted an inventive government rather than an orderly government that's a really interesting idea applied Up to companies we want an inventive company rather than an orderly company I think big bureaucratic companies right they optimized for order over invention where startups are smaller Little groups of small smart people actually want the the opposite i like that idea Roosevelt wanted an inventive government rather than an orderly government not a team of reliable Workhorses but a but a team of high spirited and sensitive thoroughbreds even if that meant he must spend time handholding his prima donnas that just made me think of something let me Grab it actually i have a couple quotes when i got to this section it's about how uh it says FDR and Bush brevity is the soul of wit David Ogilvy has really influenced my thinking on the importance Of brevity but then i'm just sitting here thinking he's like oh like he wants an inventive government rather than an orderly government and he's willing even if he has to spend time handholding His prima donnas i'm like where have i heard that before i just put in the term lay golden eggs this comes from confessions of an advertising man which is david ogivy's autobiography I did this all the way back on founders number 89 i got to reread that book soon it's been when did i put that podcast out September 15 2019 yeah i got it overbeez like a hero of mine now i got To reread ([Time 0:44:42](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fea4db50-a56d-4ce3-a47c-098a9b5a60e4))
    - **Note:** Fdr wanted an inventive not an orderly government. Not work horses but race horses even if that meant they were tough to manage. Brevity is the soul of whit. You need to cultivate and tolerate genius they are disagreeable or destroy them because they lay golden eggs. He wrote a one page of paper to detail his 6 point war effort plan. Fdr wrote back in 15 minutes ok. Dont fall behind stay ahead of the sticks creativity wise never get lost in the sauce precrastinate. Have a personal motto bush’s was don’t let the bastards get you down. Bush organized the experts to develop the bomb he protected those research to do their work. Bush was an admin manager. We live in a tough world and you need to do anything you can to win.

  Of those actions that this is this is an idea that opinheimer groves and bush are discussing one of those actions might be the kidnapping of the top nazi physicist warner hyzenberg who At the time was considered the key to germany's hope for an atomic bomb this idea was taken seriously enough by robert omnheim opinheimer that he discussed the possibility of of kidnapping Kidnapping hyzenberg with bush and groves bush doubted the value of the hyzenberg scheme but this is the reason i'm saying i'm reading this point he had no moral qualms but that the kidnapping Would be hard to carry off and then he goes into the amount of stress and anxiety he's under he's really there's only like one other person maybe he might be the only person having his set Of experiences in the world bush felt isolated and he knew he had few people to lean on he was well aware of the extraordinary loneliness of his own situation the anxiety was intense yet Bush refused to trouble the president president simply in order to calm his nerves he later said of a situation no one who has not been placed in in a post of heavy responsibility can realize What a lonesome feeling it is the best antidote for bush's anxiety was action and then there's a great description of like the tangible effects of bush's work along with thousands maybe Tens of thousands of other people but really the ([Time 0:54:01](https://share.snipd.com/snip/acfac20d-b345-4531-9244-8797898c4bff))
    - **Note:** Bush was incredibly lonely and had a lot of stress and secrets he needed to keep but he did this because he had to despite it being difficult he never shifted the burden. The more resourceful people end up winning the allies started behind the axes but ended up outproducing 4-1 by the end of the war. Memex set the idea for the personal computer and thought memory was associative. we all face death and we must make the most of our lives. At the end of the bomb bush only felt relief. He married science and the state invention and destruction.
