### Highlights

- Anyone can be good in the country there are no temptations that’s why they’re uncivilized. 2 ways to become civilized by being cultured or curropted but country people can’t be either so they stagnate. Dorian is trying to reform and makes self sacrifice. Death and vulgarity are the only 2 things people can’t explain away. Marriage is a bad habit but one regrets the loss of all habits and bad the most because they’re such an essential part of your personality. Anything becomes a pleasure when one does it too much. If a man treats life artistically his brain is his heart. What does it profit a man to gain the whole world but lose his soul. The things one feels are absolutely certain are never true that’s the fatality of faith and of lesson of romance. Henry is talking about the power of the ignorance of youth and how he makes people intelligent. The tragedy of old age is not that you’re old but you’re young. Life isn’t governed by will or intention but a question of nerves. Life has cells where thought hides itself passion has its dream. Life is the thoughts of a morning sky or perfume that brings back a memory. A line from a forgotten poem. It is on these things our lives depend most. The inner deep trauma that defines us instinctively. Art doesn’t influence actions just expose character.
- There is purification in punishment Dorian is rueing his broken ugly soul that has lost all innocence and love. His beauty and youth he had prayed for ruined him. His beauty a mask and youth a mockery. Youth was a time at best of an unripe mind ignorance Shallow dreams and sickly thoughts. Youth spoiled him. He commits to being good is excited to look at the picture and realizes it shows he’s fooling himself. He did these good things out of pure vanity. He realizes instead of being a better person he will destroy the picture. Instead of confessing he is free and won’t be in trouble so he must destroy this picture the representation of his soul. This was his conscious and he wanted to kill it not face it and move on from the past. He stabbed the painting to kill his conscious but when he does this he ends up stabbing himself. The picture transforms to the beauty the day it was painted and he is now the old decreped man with a Knife in his heart. The painting is his soul. He kills his soul. We can’t run from our souls and our past they live within us pictures and paintings serve as passive memories to those events. We are who we are we must confront our sins and past and improve to live a good life. If we cannot do that if we can’t grow we will live an ugly pained horrible life of failure.

    - **Note:** We cannot run from the past me must confront our sins and grow through and from them. There is purification in punishment. His beauty and youth ruins him but he decides to be good. He realizes he doesn't actually want to be good but remain vain and feel good. He aims to kill his soul and when we forfeit our soul we kill ourselves and he ends up dying. We must face our problems or we will live a bad life and die a painful tortured death. Youth is a time of ignorance which spoiled him. Beauty is a fully internal not an external thing. We must face our past and grow from it or it will kill us
- Dorian knows he’s being hunted and is scared by James vain. He’s terrified of dying but indifferent to life itself. He’s terrified of life is chaos but thete is logic in the imagination. Imagination can haunt you but in the real world crimes are not always punished mental torture is the true judge. Success is given to the strong failure thrust upon the weak. His conscious is mocking Dorian with his past trauma or it is real he is unsure. The past always catches up. After a lifetime of running from it Dorian is faced with the need to reckon with it. Doesn’t leave the house for 3 days. You can’t out run who you are. Strong passions either bruise or bend. Slay the man or die. Shallow loves can be integrated into life but depth is killed. Loves that are great destroy themselves through their greatness. Carelessness of happiness and high indifference of joy. The only tragedy in the world is ennui which is basically Bordem. Someone is accidentally shot hunting Harry finds it whimsical and would love to meet a murderer and Dorian is horrified. Uncertainty charms people a mist makes one wonderful knowledge is fatal. All roads lead to disillusionment. The man who is shot is James vain and Dorian cries tears of joy knowing he is free once again. He isn’t responsible for his actions.
- The flirting between Henry’s cousin and Dorian. If it wasn’t fascinating there would be no battle in the flirt. She says there are worse things than capture and pace gives life. Henry says that a burned child loves the fire. His cousin says her wings aren’t singed and Henry says because she used them for everything but flight doesn’t have the courage to use them. She says courage is passed from men to women. It’s a new experience for women. She’s a romanticist but Henry says women are more like scientists. Romantic art begins with its climax.

    - **Note:** Flirting as a dance where one side is trying to be captured. She argues there are worse things than being captured or claimed to which Henry argues that she needs to be controlled and lacks courage to try to fly be independent and brave but she argues you find bravery and independence in relationships the freedom to stay. Henry argues women are scientists and calculated in love and that love itself begins with the greatest passion and fades over time. Honeymoon phase to a slow burn how is this avoided?
- Dorian meets Sybil’s brother who wants to kill him out of revenge he knew it was Dorian from a nickname but Dorian pleaded to show his face in the light and the brother was convinced it wasn’t him. Dorian says names are everything he never quarrels with action. Henry rejects every label has no mask. To define is to limit. All good reputations are made out of nothing. To be popular one must be a mediocrity. Women can’t bear mediocrity. Women love with their ears men love with their eyes. Romance lives by repetition and repetition converts an appetite into an art. Each times someone loves is the only time they’ve ever loved difference in object doesn’t alter singleness of passion it only intensifies passion. We can have only one great experience in life and the secret is to be able to reproduce that experience as often as possible. Especially when one has been wounded by it.

    - **Note:** Names and labels are insignificantg masks are meant to be warn and transcended to define is to limit. Love is passionate we only have the capcity for one love and the object changes and then were chasing the dragon. We want to reproduce that once great feeling. Good reputations come from nothing. Woman love ears men love eyes means words vs physical
- No one is at one’s ease more than when he has to play a part. Husband was very short sighted there is no pleasure in a husband who never sees anything. Middle age mediocrity has no enemies but it’s thoughroughly disliked by his friends. A man who thought his joviality could substitute for his lack of ideas. When a woman married again it’s because she detested her first husband when a man marries again it’s because he addored his first wife. Women try their luck and men risk theirs. A man can be happy with any women as long as he doesn’t love her. He likes men with a future and women with a past. Passion makes people think in a circle. Ugliness not beauty now became what Dorian craved. He needed it to drive out his pain. Dorian is running to opium dens to escape from himself. Memory was eating his soul away we wanted to be where no one was. He ruined this guys life and wonders if he should care but realizes he can’t. Each man lived his own life paid his own price you couldn’t shoulder other burdens. The pity he thought was you had to pay so much for a single fault. Destiny never closed its accounts. Our mind tortured us with our past. There are moments when the passion for sin dominates the body that we lose free will and conscious and become automata. All sins are sins of disobedience/ rebellion.
- Man was a being with myriad lives a sensation a complex multi form creature. Terrible tedium for people whose life denies nothing. Dorian gray was poisoned by a book where he could look on evil as mode where he could realize his conception of the beautiful. Dorian is visited by basil and basil pleas with him to be a better person Dorian allows him to see the painting. Basil sees the portrait and what Dorian has become each of us has heaven and hell in us. Dorian allows basil to see him as he is and basil sees the horror and wants to help Dorian can’t bear this and kills basil. He saw his soul wanted to say prayers and help but Dorian just killed him. He couldn’t bear someone seeing his soul. He couldn’t even think or look at the man he was dispassionate about the whole thing and thought it was poetic justice the man who ruined his life had been ruined by his creation. Dorian then starts thinking about hiding the body and moving on. He slept very well without much trouble. Sins more in the memory than doing but this wasn’t one of those this was something to be driven out of the mind through drugs. Dorian aims to forget and not think about his crime suppress it until he has to. Dorian calls for his old friend. Dorian calls on someone he had wronged from his past says it’s just like a normal dissection and when the man refuses Dorian writes him a piece of paper and expose something about him if he doesn’t help. Blackmail him. Campbell who clearly hates Dorian realizes he has no choice but to help him. Regretfully does Dorian was crying his life was over not that he killed his friend. Transformation is complete

    - **Note:** denial spices up your life. Dorian has friends who want to help but this is a turning point when he turns into his ugly side and neglects it. Transformation in someones life. Being distroyed by creation. Sins are in the anxiety not the act. Memory is what harms us. He is afraid to show his soul his true self. Blackmail and being a bad person
- When we wake up we come from our world of dreams or nightmares into reality. Seeing letters we need to read of have read too much. Nothing seems changed and real life comes back and we must come back and put on our mask to continue the energy we exert of being us in society. We live stereotyped habits and we hope that one day we will wake and live the life of our dreams when we open our eyes. We get a fresh world a fresh life the one we want. The past had no place we were no longer bound by our pasts but we can live our new created lives. This was Dorian’s ideal world. He would want to try on different masks and then discard him. Trying life plans out to experience them then discard them. He thought about becoming catholic. He never liked any one philosophy more than life and hedonism itself. He wore many masks but owned none he was many things but he was also nothing. Just experience and other peoples personalities. He would try everything but grow tired of each. Explore who you want to be and commit to your life he is trying everything but losing his sense of self. He studies the beauty of the past and wonder why if he can keep it the beauty of the past has been lost. He would throw himself into these things but never really stayed or changed. Fully present in these ideas but also in not changing he’s never really present. He’s really an actor. He used all these as means of forgetfulness but then he would be reminded of his would destruction through his portrait. These were all distractions. He was terrified of people seeing the picture his true self but also realized if they saw it and even if he explained jt it wouldn’t change much or be a big deal. Worried about the world finding out his secret. Society doesn’t want to believe negative things about rich smart people. Insincerity isn’t bad it’s just a way we can multiply our personalities.
- Dorian would look at his portrait and how the lines of both age and sin were added to it. He would sit and laugh at how he was able to keep his youth while this portrait became old. He became beauty, personified and hosted many parties. He gave into his own vanity. He became a man associated with and beauty, but he also wanted to create his own philosophy. True nature of the senses have never been understood his new philosophy has at its center beauty. Dorian sees so much self torture and denial in human history that came from fear and result was a terrible degradation of humanity. He wanted to bring back hedonism drive out Puritanism. Its goal was passionate experience never sacrificing that experience not the fruits of experience but the system was experience itself. Concentrate on the moments of your life and be present.

    - **Note:** Dorian gives into his own vanity and wants to start his own philosophy of hedonism where you are living for maximum fun in the moment. Fully present but also fully geared towards externals. Wants to liberate humanity with vanity without considering any of the negative consequences living for every not considering aging or death. This is the constant entertainment die through hedonism instead of growing through hardship. Excitement orgy without any thought
- Dorian wrapped his painting in an ornate cloth from Venice. Gold and purple that had been used to cover the dead. Now it would cover something worse than death. Something that would breed horrors and never die. His sins would be like a worm to a corpse marring the beauty in the painting. It would be defiled and shameful yet always alive. Basils love was fully noble and intellectual not physical love that tires of the senses. Basil could’ve saved him if he gave him the chance and was honest but now it wasn’t possible the past can be forgotten and inihilated but the future is inevitable. He would have an outlet for his sins dreams that made the shadow of his evil real. He hid his soul in the attic. It was a novel without a plot that sums up all the passions of every century but his own. Sum all the passions of man. The renunciations that men call virtue. And the natural rebellion which men call Sin. Written both vividly and obscure. Technical expressions and elaborate paraphrases that are used together.

    - **Note:** Our sins will always eat at us. He has a chance to rectify his sins but rejects this chance and cements his character. The past can be forgotten but the future is inevitable deterministic view. Renunciation and virtue natural rebellion is sin. Humans would rather remain evil than do the hard work to be good
- Basil confesses in Dorian how he was dominated by his personality. His memory haunted basil like an equisit dream haunts all artists. He was jealous only wanted to be with him and when Dorian was away he was still present in the art. This is a crazy amazing wonderful description of love and infatuation. Basil saw perfection the world became wonderful but this also brought peril. Love and perfection fills one with indescribable wonder. The peril of losing or keeping that person is the same completely paralyzed. Art should be unconscious ideal and remote the way he influenced Basil’s art but one day he painted Dorian directly. When he did the painting and realized his idolatry was clear in the picture. When he finished and moved on basil moved on and felt It’s a mistake to think the passion one feels in creation is ever really shown in what one creates. Art conceals the artist better than it reveals it. Art is more abstract than we fancy. Form and color are just that there is no deeper Level. Dorian wonders if there will ever be someone so strong as to made him idolize them in the same way. Dorian influences basils art more than anything. This is basils confession he feels free after call back to Henry’s quote on confession. Maybe you shouldn’t put your worship into words basil says. There is something fatal about a portrait he has a life of his own. Basil likewise can’t be Dorian’s true friend he’d rather paint him and simp for him than get tea with him. Not real friendship. Dorian realized after hearing this the tragedy of a friendship colored in romance. The issue with falling in love with a friend its tragedy of life. Then he hides the painting very deep he never wants him to see the true him.

    - **Note:** Love and infatuation are complex amazing feelings. That love dominates your life. Seeing perfection and beauty in a person. It fills someone with so much wonder and the thought of losing that paralyzes. Art reveals so much about the artists and the subconscious of our life colors our actions more than we realize. Like how we feel when we have love. Fear of losing someone. True friendship is one of equality horizontal not vertical. In perfect balance. Dangers of idolizing someone and beauty of art and expressing yourself.
- Sybil lived the reality and unreality of love when she killed herself. Most people are doomed to middle class virtue but she lived a proper tragedy. You can’t complete an emotion. Basil is confused why he isn’t sad because he wants to console him. Opioid of hope type feeling. There was a man who fought 20 years for something when he finally got it his life felt empty and incomplete. We love the chase not the destination. To become a spectator of one’s life is to escape the suffering of it. Basil now wants to exhibit his painting and Dorian has a cover over it. He cannot let people see the true him. He is terrified. Dorian was

    - **Note:** We love the chase not the destination. When we become a spectator to our life we escape the suffering. Opiod of hope. When we don’t take agency and responsibility by taking the normative path we live life without failure. It may not be good but we haven’t tried novelty and lost.
- Dorian after Sybil’s death and talking to Henry has a complete about face and is willing to trade all his love and sins while remaining young at heart for the picture looking worse. Harry has convinced him he will have an easy life as long as he is young and pretty and Dorian accepts that he will pretty much put all his feelings in this picture and lock it away. It’ll be his greatest secret. This would reveal his soul to him and he would not have to trade any of his looks for it. This picture revealed to him his own body now it would reveal to him his soul. Dorian rebels about moving on so quickly. What’s done is done what’s past is past it only takes time for shallow people to get over emotions. A man who is a master of himself can get rid of a sorrow as fast as he can invent a pleasure. He wants to not be at the mercy of his emotions but to enjoy and dominate them. Basil comes down to console Dorian finds him consoled and can’t imagine why.

    - **Note:** Dorian comes to the idea that he will trade his soul for his looks that will make his life easy and make him happy. he rejects processing his emotions and seeks to dominate them moving on from negatives quickly by suppressing them in his soul, making it darker while inventing pleasure to give the façade of his youth when really his soul is decrepit
- Dorian meant to send an old toilet seat in the age. He lived in unnecessary things were the only necessity. This portrait was a visual reminder of the torture and degradation men bring upon their souls. The portrait would be what holiness is to some and consciousness to others, and the fear of God is to everyone something to guide his life. Dorian then apologizes to Sybil. There’s a luxuryin Self for reapproach. We feel when we blame ourselves. No one can blame us. It is the confession not the priest that gives us absolution. When he finished the letter he felt he had been forgiven. One can always be kind about those we feel indifferent to. A woman can only reform a man by boring him so much he loses all interest in life. There’s a fatality that good resolutions always come to late. They make us feel good but it’s the opioid of the weak. Sybil kills herself and Dorian feels bad Henry makes a point that this was like a dramatic play and often in the dramatic moments of our lives we aren’t the actors in the plays of our life but the spectators. The best thing about the past is it is the past. People never know when the curtain has fallen on life and parts in it they always want another act. We must move on. A good Conscience makes one vain. Women appreciate cruelty more than anyone they love being dominated. In Sybil’s death when she finally became herself and touched reality she died. She died like Dorian knew her another act in a play. She died for love for him.

    - **Note:** Transitions we never know when the curtain has fallen on one part of our lives and we must step into the other. Civil to reality and died because all she was was a great actress and her last bit of drama was killing her herself. Masks we wear and can’t escape. It is the confession that gives us absolution not the priest. We can be kind to who we’re different to, but when we love someone, we can always be a woman can only reform a man by boring him. A time when the unnecessary was the only necessity. We all torture our souls. Luxury in self reproach. Good resolutions always come too late it’s the opioid of the weak. Only necessity is the unnecessary
- There are only two kinds of people who are interesting people know everything and people who know nothing. The secret to remaining young is to never have an emotion as that is unbecoming. After Dorian falls for Sybil, she becomes a terrible actress because she was living through her creations and now she could live authentically herself with Dorian, so her creativity and desire is gone. She was playing a shadow with Dorian she could now come out from the shadow but he lost his love for her he fell in love with the shadows not the real her. Dorian lost his love completely for this women when she couldn’t act. She lost all of her motivation for acting. There was always something so ridiculous and the emotions of someone who you have ceased to love. He loved a lie of her and she loved him and when the lie died the love did. He is realizing that he now has an immortal soul. He realized this picture is his conscious and now he’s done evil in leaving this women he’s done a great cruelty the picture has started to degrade. Dorian swears to go back to Sybil and not talk with Henry to let his cruelty into his mind. He would resist temptation to keep the perfection of the picture. The picture represented his goodness and conscious.
- Harry is a bad boy who represents all of Dorians sins that he does not want to commit or can’t his bad side his vein side and basil represents everything good with Dorian. He sees him perfectly as a man too perfect for the world where Henry sees him as an experiment. Dorian is a dichotomy between Henry and Basil.
- Whenever someone does something bad, it’s always from the Noblest motives. He never approves or disapproved of anything. We’re not sent into the world to show our moral prejudices. Marriege makes one less self centered and more organized. We like to think well of others because we’re afraid for ourselves. Basis for optimism is sheer terror. We think we are generous because we credit our neighbor with the virtues that benefit us. We praise the banker who lets us get extra credit or the bandit who decides not to steal from us. Henry has contempt for optimism and the spoiled life no life is spoiled for ever growth is arrested. If you want to mar a nature you need to simply reform it. Pleasure is the only thing worth having a theory about. Pleasure is natures test its sign of approval when we are happy we are always good. When we are good we aren’t always happy. To be good is to be in harmony with yourself. One’s own life is the important thing one must not be as worried about the views of others. Individualistic ethic. Henry says Modern morality comes from accepting the standard of one’s age. For any man of culture to accept the morality of his age is incredibly immoral. Acting is so much more real than life. Henry represents all the sins Dorian couldn’t commit.
- Women defend themselves by attacking and attack with strange surrenders. Children begin by loving their parents then they judge them sometimes they forgive them. To be in love is surpass one’s self. Sybil’s brother is going to Australia and search of Gold and riches and she is getting married both in search of a new life and escape from poverty. Her brother is jealous and regretful of her engagement. Feels like he is being replaced and hates rich people not a fan overall of Dorian despite never meeting him. Sybil’s mom got knocked up by a man of royalty and left. She may be making the same mistake.

    - **Note:** This shows people seeking out a better life with their unique set of skills and the story of the father being imbedded in the son with sybil and her mom. Love surpasses and is a power law outcomes creating something together you both couldnt do alone. Women defend by attack and attack by defense is anger being hopelessness masquerading as frustration and machievelli. Childrens relationships with their parents is complex
- Ordinary people wait for life to disclose its secrets but to the select the mystery of life is discovered before the veil is drawn away. Dorian was Henry’s creation. Henry loved studying human nature didn’t like science just human nature. The veil is lifted through good art. Experience is the name we give to our mistakes. We misunderstand ourselves and rarely understood others. All experience demonstrated is our future will be like our past and our and the sin we did once with loathing we were destined to repeat with excitement/ joy. Dorian is an experiment for Henry. Passion about whose origins we deceived ourselves the most the tyrannized us most. Our weakest motives were the ones we were most conscious of. When we thought were experimenting on others were really experimenting on ourselves.

    - **Note:** The mysteries of this world rarely become clear to others, but the veil is lifted to the select few through art and other study. We must seek it though. Experience is the word we give to our mistakes. We misunderstand others and rarely understand ourselves. We’re destined to repeat all our mistakes human nature is cyclical. Were constantly experimenting on ourselves aware of our weakest motives and our passions tyranize us most. We realize that the emperor of life has no clothes and everyone’s making it up.
- Most people die of common sense and the only time we’re alive is when we’re making mistakes. The only things we never regret are our mistakes. Henry’s wife only hears his opinions from his friends never from him. Nowadays people know the price of everything and value of nothing. Henry was trying to bargain for things. Men marry because they are tired women because they are curious both are disappointed. Dorian isn’t likely to marry he’s too much in love. Women are matter over mind and men are mind over morals. Harry gives a lot of sexist women views here that they’re decorative sex. Passion and love about love is the mark of the idol classes. The people who love only once in their life are the shallow people. Loyalty and fidelity is custom and a lack of imagination. Faithfulness is to emotion what consistency is to intellect. Simply a confession of failure. Dorian will tell Harry everything. Harry owns his soul. It’s only the sacred things that are worth touching. Love starts with deceiving yourself and ends with deceiving others. Dorian falls in love with this actress who plays all the great heroines of history. Like Juliet from Romeo and Juliet but never considers who she is and falling in love with her just her mask. Personalities not principles drive the age. Men give away what they need most themselves depth of generosity. Good artists put everything into their work all they have left is their prejudices, principles and common sense. The only artists who are fun are the bad ones who can’t put their emotions into their work. A bad poet lives the poetry they cannot write while the good poets write the poetry they dare not live/ realize.
- Simple pleasures are the last refuge of the complex. Dorian sees the portrait and wants to rip it up. He can’t bear the fact he will grow old and he’ll want time kill himself before growing old. Says he would sell his soul to keep his beauty. Harry has poisoned his mind and woke him up. Sin is the only color element left in life. Rejecting the ornate costumes of the 19th century. Fidelity young man want to be faithful but can’t and old men want to be faithless but can’t. Philanthropists lose all touch with humanity. Dorian’s mom was a rich woman who married a poor man her family basically had him killed then she died. Traded her life for a few months of passion. Beautiful women risks everything for happiness cut short through a big crime then months of voiceless agony and snatched by death and a boy born in pain forced to live in solitude grew in the life of a loveless man. Talking to Dorian was like playing on a violin project soul into a gracious form letting it sit there hear your own views conveyed back to you with passion and youth. Convey temperament into another like it’s a perfume. The age was carnal, which is physical or sexual, in its pleasures and grossly common in its aims. Brings up Plato’s cave allegory where we see the most perfect symbolic value that is made real in the form of a shadow. Henry says you shouldn’t sympathize with pain only the positives. It’s too ugly to sympathize with pain. Thinks we should talk about the joys of life and ignore the pains of life. The original sin is that man takes himself too seriously.
- Influence is immoral to influence someone is to give them his own soul. He becomes an echo of someone else’s life. The goal of life is self discovery. To realize one’s own nature. People are afraid of themselves. Highest of all duty is the duty one owes to one’s self. The one they owe to their own soul. If a man were to live out his life fully give expression to every thought form to every feeling we could achieve a higher humanity. The bravest man is afraid of himself. The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. Resist it and your soul with grow sick. Nothing can cure the senses like the soul and nothing can cure the soul like the senses. This is Dorian’s awakening in his life. We all great great awakenings when the right thing is said at the right time and it’s so profound your entire worldview changes. Henry is doing this to Dorian. Beauty is the highest form of genius because it requires no explanation. The gift of youth and beauty is the highest gift. Beauty is superficial but not as superficial as thought. It’s only shallow people who don’t judge by appearances. What the gods give they also take away and beauty will be given and taken away. Don’t give your life away to the common and vulgar. Live the wonderful life within you let nothing be lost upon you be searching for new sensations a new hedonism. Be afraid of nothing. The world belongs to Dorian for a season. There is nothing in the world but youth we degenerate away from the haunting passions we were to afraid to explore and passions we were too afraid to yield to and explore. We never get back time. The difference between something that lasts forever and a caprice is that the caprice lasts longer.

- Beauty and intelligence are different. When people sit down to think they destroy their natural beauty. Priest look so good at 80 because they read the same book and saying the same thing for 60 years. We all suffer for what the gods have given us whether it’s wealth artistic talent or beauty. The common things when hidden become magical. Every portrait is a reflection of the artist through the person not as much the person being painted. When he met Dorian grey he grew pale his eyes met and a curios terror came over him. He met someone who’d personality was so fascinating that if he allowed it to do so he would absorb his entire soul and heart and he didn’t want any external influence in his life and let this person into his soul so he ran away. This is a crazy point on love Jesus. Friendship liking everyone means being indifferent to everyone. Dorian grey captivated him so much that he’s even more present in his pictures when he’s not in them he’s become apart of basal the artist. Abstract sense of beauty is lost in the world. Only the intellectually lost argue. He’s given his soul to someone who treats it like a flower he puts in his pocket. Genius lasts longer than beauty so we overeducate ourselves because we lose our beauty but keep the mind. However we still die so we just lose beauty and the mind at different times so we should be indifferent to the 2. The faithful know the trivial sides of love the faithless truly understand loves tragedies.

    - **Note:** We all suffer for what the gods have given us. The hidden becomes magical. A potrait is a projection. Friendship means you must like people more than others. People who captivate us leave such a deep impact that when they're not there their presence is there. We compensate by learning because genius lasts longer than beauty but we lose both so we should just be happy. nature of beauty and abstractness
- Arts aim is to reveal art and conceal the artist. Those who find ugly meanings, and beautiful things are corrupt. Those who find beautiful meanings, and beautiful things are the cultivated. There is no moral or immoral book just good books morality is relative and changes with the times. Art is just a thing that we attribute agency to. All art is surface and symbol. People often disagree on the meaning of art which adds depth to that piece. When we go beneath the surface and symbol we aren’t going deeper into the art we’re going deeper into ourselves. Art is a mirror of the observer not a product of the artist.
