  Speaker 1
  I'm trying to craft better information flows. Almost every idea that you have is downstream from what you consume. We don't usually think about it that way but like when you choose who to follow on Twitter you're choosing your future thoughts in a sense you're creating the information flow what the timeline what the feed is going to look like or when you choose what book to read or which podcast episode to listen to you're choosing the thoughts that are going to arise. Now you may not necessarily know what they are but over time you can start to learn which sources of information are higher signal than others and I almost feel like that is like the main habit to try to build especially in our current modern society because information is overflowing and so widely accessible. The person who creates better information flows gets better thoughts. ([Time 0:23:44](https://share.snipd.com/snip/30a40df1-76c6-4f3e-8bc4-c2f1e7e53643))
