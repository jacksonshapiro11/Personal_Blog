- Embrace Passion, Reject the Safe Path
  Summary:
  A career driven solely by financial gain or societal expectations can lead to dissatisfaction and a lack of fulfillment.
  When faced with a moment of failure, such as losing a job, it becomes an opportunity for self-reflection and reassessment of one’s true passions. The journey from law to the culinary world highlights the importance of pursuing what brings joy and satisfaction.
  Realizing the absence of a restaurant that served beloved dishes inspired the creation of a dream job that not only fulfilled personal desires but also aimed to uplift others in the workplace.
  The lesson emphasizes that personal fulfillment should take precedence over comfort and financial security.

  Speaker 2
  You didn't start running a restaurant, you went to law school and then became a lawyer and you were fired from that job. What happened?
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, I had a very circuitous route to becoming a lawyer in the first place that had actually taken a detour in food first. I had actually really tried. I wanted to be a chef, but I learned how to cook when I was an undergrad and I worked in restaurants in New York, but honestly, it was a really dead-end job. I was making minimum wage. I really could barely afford to pay my rent. I looked around me and I just didn't see a future in the industry. And so I did what I think plenty of smart people with a complete lack of direction choose to do and I decided to go to law school. It seemed like a prudent choice on the surface but it was really not something that I felt passionate about. So I was working as a corporate attorney so I'm getting paid you know really an obscene amount of money like an amount that seemed crazy when I had been cooking in restaurants, like 10 Times what I would have made in a year. Working in a beautiful high rise, you know, very respectable. Like I looked good at cocktail parties, but I really hated going to work every day. So I was fired and it was a real wake up call for me because I had always been just a super overachiever. And it was the first time that I was like, well, I can't say the first time, but it was probably the biggest time where I was like, wow, I am not doing well at this. And it's not even because I couldn't do well. It's because I don't want to. I don't care enough to be good at this.
  Speaker 2
  It's hard to excel at a job you hate.
  Speaker 1
  Oh my God. I mean, it sounds so basic, but I think a lot of us don't pay attention to that. We're taught to do the thing that's going to pay the bills or look good or that feels safe, but not necessarily, to my earlier point about what makes you feel good in your body. We're not trained to be like, oh, like what makes me feel, you know, real joy inside every day? Or at least that was not what I was trained to, you know, to pay attention to. So when I got fired, it was like, I had this moment of, you know, asking myself, am I going to keep doing this because I could have easily been hired, you know, somewhere else doing the same Thing? Like, am I going to choose to get back on this wheel or am I going to choose to do something else? A few months before that moment, I had been coming home on a day that was just super depressing. Like, I just had hated my work day. It's raining outside. And all I wanted to do is curl up in front of the television with just like a big bowl of mac and cheese. But I realized that there was no place I could go to get really good mac and cheese, which is sort of nuts. I mean, I live in Oakland, California. It's a major city. It seems like some place that you should be able to, you know, get a good bowl of mac and cheese, but there wasn't one. I pulled out the recipe that I had grown up making with my dad and went shopping and got the ingredients and made this delicious bowl of mac and cheese. And I'm sitting on my couch and eating it when I sort of have this aha moment thinking, huh, there was no restaurant I could go to get this. This restaurant should exist and I think I should open it. I had been sitting on that idea and sort of thinking about it. And so when I got fired, I was like, you know, I think this is my moment. Like, I think this is the moment to try this bizarre idea of opening a mac and cheese restaurant. And the truth is, if I fail, I'll just be back to what I was already doing, which is, you know, have to sell my soul to make a lot of money working as a lawyer. I realized that my worst case scenario was basically the life I was already living. So what did I have to lose?
  Speaker 2
  Which give you some safety to sort of take a risk. The moment when you were fired, what was that moment like? Were you like finally they caught me? I was slacking and I knew it or were you like, oh god.
  Speaker 1
  At the moment I was fired. I was like, oh god. I mean, I'm sort of embarrassed to say this because I really hated what I was doing, but I mean, I think I start crying. I just, yeah, I felt lost. I think that the deepest part of that moment of failure wasn't so much losing the job. I think it was realizing that I was doing something that I didn't care about, that I wasn't good at it because I didn't care about, and that I was spending sort of precious years of my life Doing something that I hated. Also, frankly, that I had had to rely on someone else to tell me that. I think that felt bad. Like I knew it already for myself, and I didn't at the time have the courage to act on it.
  Speaker 2
  So you decide to start homeroom?
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, pretty much right away. I decided to start homeroom and it was not just because I had this love of food and cooking, but I honestly looked back at that earlier time that I had been cooking in restaurants and thought, What would it be like to create the kind of place I wish I had been able to work where I could, you know, see a future for myself where I would love coming to work every day. It was really sort of this personal odyssey to create the job that I had wanted to have, but also where other people would feel a similar like passion that I did. I don't know about you, but I had. Mean, I'd worked many jobs and not had that experience of being excited to wake up in the morning and go to work. And that feels like a sad way to live life. So I really, really wanted that for myself, but I also really wanted that for other people because it felt pretty empty if I created my dream job, but then other people felt like it was A slog. ([Time 0:07:38](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e886e082-0a4b-403e-a588-ec17a5bb40c0))
    - **Note:** Getting fired working in a job you hate and taking a big chance with your life to do something authentic to you. Creating a dream job.
- Freedom Thrives Within Structure
  Summary:
  Complete freedom in the workplace can lead to less motivation and engagement.
  Employees may take fewer vacations when given unlimited options due to fear of overusing their entitlement. Establishing guidelines and structures can create a balance that encourages productivity without stifling creativity.
  Additionally, fostering a collaborative culture is essential but challenging.
  Open book management enhances engagement by sharing financials with the team, teaching financial literacy, and collaboratively working towards improving outcomes, thus creating a sense of ownership and recognition among employees.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  In a workplace, you don't ever really feel like you have complete freedom. To my point about the vacation policy, if you tell people they can take however much they want, studies have shown they actually take less than at companies where there's just a set amount Of weeks, and it's because people are actually afraid, even though in theory they can take as much as they want, they're afraid that maybe they'll take too much. So I think in a workplace having some guidelines and structures, the right ones, the coloring book has the most freedom.
  Speaker 2
  There's also an element of paying attention, right? It's like if I have complete freedom, initially that starts off as fun, but then you're like, look, look at all these amazing things I'm doing and nobody's noticing. What are some of the other lessons that you sort of trial and erred your way through?
  Speaker 1
  I knew that I wanted us to have a really collaborative work culture, which is again, a really fabulous ideal, but can be harder to pull off in reality. Something I ended up learning about, which I thought was really fabulous was open book management, which is basically where you open up your financials to your team and you teach financial Literacy. Then you engage people in improving those numbers and then you share the results with the team. ([Time 0:19:02](https://share.snipd.com/snip/118ca96a-843c-4f04-b811-1c0448cd4de8))
    - **Note:** She wanted creativity and freedom for her employees and she she used trial and error and got rid of rules but no rules is the same as too many rules. You need a good balance of guidance between control and anarchy are 2 sides of the same coin. Yiu can’t have no drsss code because then people worry about what they’ll wear. Alllw constraints to enable creativity. Give a clear focus. She had the idea of creating the best possible experience for 5 tables a night but allowed waiters to design what that was for themselves so some sang songs some comped meals. It’s all about empowering the unique creativity of others. Open book management being honest with your employees about the company allow them to take responsibility for metrics like food cost in the P+L. Radical honesty. Also measures and improved happiness constantly so they had average staff tenure of 2.5 years vs market average if 90 days. Herring people more involved and included.
- Empower Through Transparency and Collaboration
  Summary:
  Fostering a flat organizational structure enhances employee engagement and accountability without the downsides of hierarchical dynamics.
  Weekly meetings that involve frontline employees facilitate the identification of inefficiencies, as shown in a case where cheese portioning errors led to inflated costs. By giving employees the data and a framework for decision-making, they feel empowered and invested in the company's success.
  Adopting a 'collective success' model further aligns decisions with the interests of customers, employees, and the company, helping to avoid self-serving proposals.
  Conversations that promote transparent analysis of changes can lead to deeper understanding and stronger morale, as employees recognize the impacts of their decisions on the broader organization.
  Encouragingly, small businesses can gradually implement transparency by selecting specific metrics to improve, thus sharing in the benefits of collective efforts, ensuring everyone feels part of the solution and rewarded for their contributions.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, I mean, I think actually the thing with the food costs is so great. Like if you think about the way even the public companies run, you're right, certain numbers might be public or all staff members could know them, but there's a difference between that Information coming from the top and maybe trickling down. Maybe not, you know, like I don't know how many like Chipotle employees are like, you know, reviewing their financials on a weekly basis, you know, but I think something that is really Magical about this way of operating is that it's much more flat. It's not hierarchical. And so, you know, everyone is involved. To your point about the food costs, that is actually an issue that we did have happen. We watch not just our food costs, but we line item our dairy costs, because the biggest part of running a mac and cheese restaurant, they were skyrocketing one year and we could not figure Out why our costs of like cheese and milk had not gone up substantially. We were just running through stuff really, really quickly. And so, you know, at most companies, you'd have someone sitting in office looking at that, like, I'm honestly not super sure how they would have gotten to the bottom of it, because they're Not there on the ground. But because we're looking at it in the context of these meetings every week, and having people who are on the ground and working, seeing this stuff, you know, someone at the meeting suggested They were like, hey, I've been noticing, you know, we portion out the cheese in every single mac and cheese. So each one gets exactly a quarter pound of cheese, which is a rather insane amount of cheese. And they were noticing that there had been some really like sloppy work on the part of folks who were coming in early in the morning to do this that didn't look like they were actually measuring It to the ounces they're supposed to be they're just sort of throwing it in there and so we went down we started measuring out like we pulled some of these you know bag of cheese out of a fridge And started measuring that are weighing them and sure enough they are off by like some pretty large amounts honestly sometimes less than they're supposed to be. There's a lot of variability totally but there shouldn't have been like we're paying people to sit there and like literally weigh out cheese portions so that everyone gets consistent Food but also so that our food costs remain stable and they were just not really doing it. So that became something that we then started tracking and we started like pulling baggies out randomly every week, you know, and measuring them and sure enough when you start measuring It, that number magically improves. We never had to like go talk to people and discipline them. We're like, hey, these are not coming out the same and we're going to start looking at it. And like magically, the problem solves itself. If we have each single mac and cheese that we sell being over by even like a tenth of an ounce of cheese, over the course of a year, we would have given away a ton of free cheese, like literally A ton. We've figured that out, solved that problem, saved ourselves all of that money. I don't know how that would have gotten solved in a bigger company. I think it would have been figured or not in a bigger company, but one which works more hierarchically. It would have been figured out, but it would have taken a lot of time, a lot of effort. And I think what's more is all the people on the ground were able to feel empowered because they were like, oh, I just made a difference. Like I caught this problem. I just saved us, you know, tens of thousands of dollars for the year. And I think that is really empowering.
  Speaker 2
  And it feels good. It feels like you're part of something larger than yourself, too.
  Speaker 1
  Totally.
  Speaker 2
  What other problems have you solved sort of counterintuitively through radical transparency or open book management?
  Speaker 1
  I'd say sort of building on it, like how I was saying that, you know, we started out figuring like, how do we create sort of the structures upon which people can be successful and then sort Of built upon that like open book management. I think when you start having a lot more transparency and a lot more collaboration, you also start to need, honestly, structures to sort of help you, you know, think about how to make Good decisions. And so we started to use, I call it collective success, but it's basically just like a stakeholder analysis. Decisions that we were making through how is this going to benefit the customer or in the community? How is this going to benefit the employees? And how is this going to benefit the company? Because we're measuring all of these different things all the time, it's pretty easy for us to tell, like biometrics, what are the effects going to be? And we started making decisions by needing to maximize the largest degree of overlap for benefit to those three parties. And I think that has been really, really helpful. Giving people data and the ability to improve it is really helpful, but also giving everyone a framework for like, how are we going to set aside what we're going to maximize is so important.
  Speaker 2
  Is there a particular decision that comes to mind when you think of that, that you're like, oh, this really helped me see or solve this problem in a different light looking through this Collective success model?
  Speaker 1
  One of the huge benefits of running a company that's very employee centric and really empowers its people is that you have all these empowered people. And one of the is like you have all these people, you know, you have a lot of folks who have a lot of opinions and are very vocal. One example is we used to have a language on our menus, we had a surface charge and they could leave an additional tip. And a number of servers came in and wanted to speak at one of the open book meetings because they wanted to propose a change to that language because they felt if there was different language On the menu, people would leave far bigger tips for them. Good suggestion. But the problem is this group of people, servers within most restaurants are actually the people already the most amount of money. And so having this language actually really helpful because we didn't have to say like, oh, no, we don't want to, you know, no one had to be like, no, I don't want to do that. It didn't become a battle. We actually just walked through the analysis. We were like, OK, if we're going to make this change, what is the impact on the employees? And they were like, well, it'll be great for servers, because we'll make more money. And then we're like, OK, well, great. How about the folks in the kitchen who are not going to see a part of those tips? You know, what do you think that's going to feel like to them? And they had to be like, oh, yeah, I guess maybe that won't feel great. We walked through and looked at the customer. OK, how is this going to feel for the customer who's now paying more money? And they're... ([Time 0:24:24](https://share.snipd.com/snip/db8b3227-632e-4836-807c-f9d2aef04b0e))
    - **Note:** Benefit of open book management in action. Seeing from the front and being included makes a difference. Empowering people allowing them to contribute to gain leverage. Having the right conversation and thinking through things properly to get the best outcome. Sharing success.
- Choose Meaningful Hardship Over Meaningless Struggle
  Summary:
  Starting small in any endeavor can lead to significant improvements.
  Focus on one key metric that employees can influence, measure it, and establish a benchmark. Sharing success derived from these improvements fosters a sense of ownership and motivation among employees.
  Even amid challenges, perspective is crucial; while all worthwhile pursuits are hard, choosing work that feels meaningful is vital.
  Life's inherent difficulties, including parenting, can be fulfilling despite their challenges.
  Ultimately, embracing meaningful hardship leads to greater satisfaction than pursuing a path devoid of responsibility.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  You could start really small. You know, you don't necessarily have to start by opening up everything all at once. Maybe you just pick something that you really want people to work on. I would say pick a number that you care about improving that is dynamic and is that employees can make a difference on. Start measuring it and then set a benchmark, you know, like that you'd like to reach and share the success. I mean that is part of it is if you're gonna do this, if you think that improving that number could make a difference to the tune of, don't know, $10,000 that year, share $1,000 of that with The folks who helped make it happen. You'll still be $9,000 richer at the end of the day. So you do have to teach it, involve people, but also share in the success.
  Speaker 2
  Was there a moment with homeroom when you wanted to give up, or when you're sitting on your kitchen floor at home after the end of a long day and you're crying and you're just like, I can't Do this.
  Speaker 1
  I think that's the beauty of like having been quite unhappy in my work before doing homeroom is I think I knew what the alternative look like. My worst days at homeroom were still better than my best days as a lawyer. I think it helped give me perspective that everything is hard, and what kind of hard do you want? And I'll pick meaningful hard any day over meaningless hard. Most things in life worth doing are hard. I know you have kids as well. That's hard. It is really hard to be a parent. Studies on human happiness show that people who choose not to have children are on average happier because they can just like do whatever they want all the time. You know, for me, my kids are also one of the most meaningful parts of my life. ([Time 0:32:45](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2bd9000b-9c3c-47a0-aa54-b36f71525f6d))
    - **Note:** Love is hard but you need to choose your hard. Having kids leads to less short term happiness but much more meaning in life. Choose your hard. don’t find work that it’s hard and meaningless. Kids is less happy in the moment but more happy long term. Restorative justice is when you try to talk with someone and walk through what they did and who they hurt and how can they make it right. It’s not about messing up as much as it’s about understanding the wrong and figuring out who was effected so you can right the wrong. When they don’t care to make a change it becomes clear they don’t care and can be fired. This is a helpful practice outside of work too. Focus on the pricier not the person.
- Evolve or Fade: The Future of Work
  Summary:
  The current state of the restaurant industry reflects a broader reckoning with the meaning of work and its value in people's lives.
  Rising costs and a shift towards remote work have led many to rethink their careers, resulting in staffing shortages and declining sales. Restaurants are often viewed as uninspiring workplaces, prompting individuals to seek more fulfilling opportunities.
  This period necessitates reconfiguration and encourages creativity, experimentation, and adaptation.
  Ultimately, challenging moments tend to foster significant positive changes, as only the strongest ideas thrive in the long run.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I got to go and have the time to write a book about it. We're sitting here right now. I think that it was never about calcifying that culture in one organization for the rest of time. It was how do we make work that's worth doing for more people? And I think to that end, I'm very proud to have sold and been able to write the book and be able to influence more people, I why do you think?
  Speaker 2
  Same store sales or you know restaurant location sales are down for most restaurant changes most restaurant brands whether small or large I mean, they're all suffering through this You're not what do you think is the cause of this?
  Speaker 1
  This is Honestly, one of the hardest times that I've seen in the restaurant industry in all the years I've been in it. I think we're sort of in a moment of reckoning and change. Costs have gone up. I think people are rethinking the meaning of work and what's worth their time. And most restaurants, like I said, are not inspiring places to work. So I think a lot of people have said, I don't need to do this with my life. So restaurants, you know, nationally are having really hard time staffing, really hard time making money, like the face of cities have changed in the face of like, you know, a lot of Work going remote. So I think it's just a moment of like reconfiguration and change. And I think all industries go through it. And I think it's just being particularly heartfelt in the restaurant industry right now. There's a lot to be learned from the people who are creative and trying new things and experimenting with new things. I think the hardest moments are usually what give rise to lasting positive change because only the best ideas make it in the long run.
  Speaker 2
  You said in your book that you manage for impact not intent. ([Time 0:55:18](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c1c5cdfe-d626-4caf-aacd-4bba4198cc54))
    - **Note:** Restaurant industry is changing and struggling how can we improved the lived experience at restaurants through deeper connections.
- Embrace Your Identity: Titles Matters
  Summary:
  Titles profoundly influence both self-perception and external recognition.
  They shape how individuals see themselves, fostering pride and a sense of belonging. Embracing titles like 'chef' or 'CEO' can enhance credibility and open doors to new opportunities, mentorships, and networks.
  The act of identifying with a title transforms one's mindset and behavior, leading to an empowered identity that compels individuals to pursue their passions more seriously.
  This shift not only impacts personal satisfaction and growth, but it also alters external perceptions, allowing for greater respect and consideration in professional spheres.
  Ultimately, the narrative we tell ourselves significantly impacts our actions and aspirations, reinforcing the notion that self-identification is key to achieving personal success and fostering meaningful relationships.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  You are a strong advocate for titles. And I want to get this quote right. You say titles reflect how the world sees us, but more importantly, how we see ourselves.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, I do think titles are incredibly important. I think like most things I've realized are important. I realized how important it was by sort of messing it up the first time and learning over time sort of why it matters. I guess I can illustrate it best just with, you know, my own journey with it. I'm an owner of a small restaurant in the grand scheme of things as well as we do it's still just a singular business. As I started gaining more prominence for our ideas about what we're doing in the workplace, our sexual harassment system, I started doing a lot more interviewing and I would always Get asked like, okay, what's your title? I was actually in conversation with this reporter from the New York Times and she's like, okay, so are you the chef? And I was like, oh, no, no, I'm not, I'm not a chef. After we got off the phone, I was like, God, why don't I consider myself a chef? Like I literally, I made all the recipes, I've published a cookbook, I own this restaurant. I mean, like,'m not a chef, who the heck is one? That's just a bizarre thing to say, but I had this vision in my head that a chef is someone who's a really, really serious cook. They spent all their days in the kitchen and that wasn't me. It was similarly with CEO. I thought of CEOs as like you needed to be the head of some gigantic company. You needed to have like a full stack of people, you know, C-level titles beneath you. I just decided to start experimenting. I was like, you know, what is it going to sound like in that New York Times interview if I'm not a chef or I'm not a CEO? Like, I think I'm not going to get taken as seriously for my food or for my business ideas. And so I just decided to actually just embrace those titles and see what happens. I started speaking at conferences for CEOs. There was like groups that I could not join previously because I did not consider myself a CEO that I now could be part of. That created a lot of like, you know, mentorship opportunities for me. But it just really expanded my network, it expanded my reach, it really affected how seriously people took me. So I started encouraging everyone within the company, we started really just leveling up everyone's titles. There's so much pride associated with having a title that is more serious and you start acting like that. Someone who cooks versus someone who's a chef, that is a very different level that you're gonna think about cooking and food. Someone who is a leader and someone who is a CEO, same deal.
  Speaker 2
  We talked a lot about the external impact in terms of like, oh, maybe the Times reporter takes me seriously, maybe somebody reading it is gonna take it seriously, I'm gonna have a bigger Impact outside, but what about the impact inside? So you just touched on it briefly, but how did it change you to like recognize yourself that way, just as it changes a cook, maybe to a chef and the pride that you take in your work?
  Speaker 1
  If you're like someone who likes to ride bicycles versus you're a cyclist or like someone who like, you know, sort of dicks around in the ocean or a surfer, you know? I do think that there is tremendous power in saying something about yourself and saying, no, I am a surfer, I am a CEO, I am a chef. I just found that I felt a lot more pride in myself, you know? Those identities meant something, not just to the external world, but to me, I found them personally empowering. Something that like when I would get like a little lost, I could come back to and think like, what does it mean to be this, you know?
  Speaker 2
  I often say the most powerful story in the world is the one that we tell ourselves. And if you tell yourself, I am a runner, it makes it a lot easier to go for a run than if you think of yourself as a casual jogger.
  Speaker 1
  100%. If you're a runner, you're going to create a training schedule for yourself. You're going to start like, you know, part of your identity.
  Speaker 2
  Totally.
  Speaker 1
  So if you don't do it for a few weeks, it's going to matter to you, you know, you're going to be in better shape. You're going to have more pride in what you do. Your times are going to be better. Like that's a different thing.
  Speaker 2
  What is success for you?
  Speaker 1
  Success for me is I think just having meaningful relationships in my life, whether it's with work, with family and creating ways for other people to do the same. ([Time 1:00:48](https://share.snipd.com/snip/34db7d50-c99f-428b-b25d-ea7a07b8844d))
