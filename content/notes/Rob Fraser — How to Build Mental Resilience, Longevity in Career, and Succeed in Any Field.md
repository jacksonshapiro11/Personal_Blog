### Highlights

- Embrace Authenticity and Long-Term Vision
  Summary:
  Removing ego from decision-making is crucial for sustainable business success.
  Entrepreneurs should not chase fleeting trends or quick fixes, but focus on building a resilient business with a long-term outlook. Accepting market dynamics and the natural ebbs and flows can prevent unnecessary stress.
  Authenticity in operation, including falling in love with the product and prioritizing genuine customer interactions, enhances both employee morale and customer loyalty.
  Maintaining mental and physical health is essential for entrepreneurs, as it directly impacts their ability to lead effectively and make sound decisions.
  Adopting a holistic approach that values health, family, and business ensures a balanced yet dynamic lifestyle, where each pillar supports the others. In a high-performance environment, it's vital to tilt the scales in favor of personal wellbeing rather than striving for equal balance among competing priorities.

  Speaker 1
  I'd say the number one thing we talked about was removing ego. Let's just not do things because we think they're the thing to do. Let's just do the right things. We need to understand that we can't necessarily change the market. We can't create demand that's not there at our current size right now. We need to be okay with the ebbs and flows. And we don't need to, when things are not going well, or we're in a slower period, we don't need to try and artificially inflate that. We don't need a Hail Mary. You know, silver bullets and like hacks and all these things, they're so appealing to an entrepreneur. Every entrepreneur is like, you're just in it, right? It's so hard. And when someone has this new hack or new thing, it's that fallacy of like, oh, that one thing I'm not doing is going to solve all of my problems, unlock all of the growth. And it's just not true. And the worst thing that can happen is the one time that maybe that silver bullet does work because then it teaches you that, oh, there's hacks here. So I always kind of caution, like if you get lucky, just appreciate it. But these hacks typically don't work. What we ended up doing is just extending the time horizon. You know, like I said, I was trying to rush before to, for, for what reason though, to, it was literally expectations I had put on myself. No one around me was saying you need to grow at X or do Y. It was really me just feeling like I needed, know, to gain acceptance of people that already accepted me. It was kind of weird. And it was really just the self-discovery of being like, no, these people already accept me. I'm doing what I do. It's kind of that kid again, right? Of like, oh, if I don't keep performing and outperforming and winning, maybe they won't like me anymore. I won't be accepted anymore. And then just being okay with like, look, you know, I have to just operate this authentically. And I asked myself, what would it look like for this business to be around in 20 years? Forget about what we grow this year. How do we build a business that endures over time? And that makes the building so much more fun. How do we actually get back? I fell back in love with the product again this year, right? I love socks. It's such a weird thing to say, but one of my superpowers is I actually really love socks and care about the product. And that comes through in the product that we offer. People love them as well because I'm obsessed with making it better. And, you know, like I'm obsessed with the customer feedback around it and falling in love with the product, serving the customer, extending the time horizon and not doing things because Your ego is dictating it. That's a pretty good recipe for business success. The thing that gives me the most joy is, you know, sit down with our team now and we're talking about the future and it feels like we're on our toes and not our heels now. And they're also feeling really inspired. And they're saying, you know, even when, you know, like there's still challenges, you know, business is still super hard, but we're dealing with the hard problems calmly. We're like, we can figure this out. We've learned the tough lessons and we planned for this versus throwing Hail Marys. You know, it's like we were operating from a position of just trying to play catch up on on hitting our arbitrary goals that didn't really matter. And it ultimately led to an unhappy work environment. It was stressful and it just wasn't fun. I was like, why are we doing this? We do this because we enjoy what we do. We enjoy learning and improving. And that was the big unlock is ultimately just extending the time horizon being like, what makes us happy running this business?
  Speaker 2
  It's interesting when you think about extending the time horizon, so many different ways to do that, right? Not going into debt, there's operating from a position where we can run a marathon instead of a sprint. It's not taking advantage of your customers and treating them as a win-win, like you're going to be a customer for life. Is there anything else that comes to mind when you think of extending the time horizon?
  Speaker 1
  In order to extend the time horizon, I need to be physically and mentally as healthy as I can be. Same with our team. This doesn't work if we're not all operating to the best of our ability to. And the business has been so stressful, like any business over the last 10 years, that it really took a toll on my body. Specifically over the last two years, we had a few very stressful events and I didn't deal with them. I dealt with them well in business, the rest of my life kind of fell apart in my body and realizing that that's not a sustainable path to go on. Like being an athlete for so long and a younger, like in younger in general, it was like I death gripped through life. You know, I was just like, I learned very early with the injuries I rode through is like, oh, you can just, just make it through this. You can just brute force your way through this. And that's not the best approach always in business. And especially if you have an extended time horizon and longevity in mind, right? It's like the same idea of, are you better off consistently working out or going once a week and just like demolishing yourself? And the consistency is going to be better for sure. I had kind of like three goals this year is like, get the business back to a place where we're thriving and having fun, get my health back to a place where I feel confident and inspired and Like kind of all in on this. And the third one was the more personal. It was just like, you know, I had a new kid. I have two boys and one was born this year. It was really just like, you know, like really focused on the family because I had my first kid during like the real thick of business and during COVID as well. And, you know, I really wanted to kind of enjoy the process of this. So it was kind of like, you know, family business and health were three core pillars and those things holistically all need to be kind of going well for me to operate at my best. You know, we talk about work-life balance, which is like, I hate the concept of it in entrepreneurship, you know, like for, for an, like a salaried worker, like, sure, like balance should Be, you know, something that you're thinking about, but in particular in sport or high performance careers or something that you're doing, it's like, you need to tilt the scale in your Favor. Right. And that's by definition, no balance. However, I think what gets missed here is that part of the work for an entrepreneur, like an athlete is like your health and your personal relationships. If those aren't in a good spot, you're not operating at 100% efficiency. And so that's part of the work, right? What's not part of the work is maybe partying or doing things that you shouldn't be doing that are going to set you further back. But people think about, if I say work-life balance is a joke, People are like, oh, what about your health? Health is included in the work. And I think it's such an important part of it too. It's like, how can you be a high performance entrepreneur? How can y... ([Time 0:42:30](https://share.snipd.com/snip/85df13d6-0120-4b30-b964-8c5c7d0d229a))
    - **Note:** Set the right authentic goals. Consistency over intensity. Work life balance is necessary for success. Positive compounding we exist in multitudes mosaic of life. We need to take care of our health and have recovery protocols for our mental health
- Embrace Challenges as Learning Opportunities
  Summary:
  Experiencing significant challenges, such as legal issues and the necessity for rebranding, catalyzes growth and learning in business.
  Navigating a cease and desist from an external company following a major capital raise underscores the importance of understanding intellectual property law and the complexities of branding. Reacting to external pressures highlights the dual nature of challenges: the situation itself and one's response to it.
  Emphasizing that burnout often stems from working on tasks misaligned with one’s mission rather than sheer workload, it becomes clear that focusing on productive passion is crucial for sustainability.
  The process of rebranding, prompted by the need to adapt rather than contest, illuminates the essence of a brand as how it makes customers feel, rather than merely what it is called.
  This experience fosters understanding that a business's name can evolve while maintaining its core values and mission, allowing growth despite temporary setbacks. Discussing the evolution of brand identity enhances community engagement, emphasizing the importance of collaboration and shared ownership in building a resilient brand. The lesson here is that embracing and learning from challenges not only strengthens an individual’s skill set but also cultivates a more robust and adaptable organization.

  Speaker 1
  There was capitalizing the business for the first time, like actually having some, some firepower behind what we want to invest in. And then also inviting in some voices that I was so desperate for of people I admired. So it was kind of this opportunity. I remember telling, you know, a bunch of friends and my wife being like, you'll never get this. Like all my business heroes like want to give me money and invest in the company. Like this seems almost like cheating. This isn't, this is incredible. So I passed on that opportunity, but literally the day the money hit the account, we raised millions of dollars. It hits the account. I get an email from my lawyer that says urgent in the subject line. And that's just almost never a good thing. And it's from my IP attorney, which I rarely hear from. It was our first ever cease and assist. And it basically said, you know, there's a company that believes they have rights over your name and is demanding that you do X, Y, and Z. And one of those would stop using the name. And so I was kind of like immediately just shook because we just raised all this money. We've been in business for five years. And that was the first time, you know, in sport and in business to that point, everything was something that like, I was solving problems that I created I wasn't battling somebody like I was in charge this was something happening to us that was completely out of control on and I had no frame for it I had never gone through it before I didn't know anyone that went through It for maybe half an hour I was like this is a death blow you know like I was kind of like let myself. And then I called you actually, I called a few other people. I was like, okay, this is not uncommon, but it was incredibly stressful. And it basically led us onto this six-month journey of rebranding and changing our name. And that's an incredibly complex process for a business that's been around for five years. And how do you even start that process of communicating the messaging? What is a name that's going to work? And the stress, I think ultimately the stress came down to was not messing it up, right? I had so many people that relied on me at that point. I had a young family, I had employees, I had investors, I had what felt like the world on my shoulders. And none of them were putting that pressure on me. I put it on myself because I told you I take these responsibilities incredibly seriously. If someone gives me money or bets on me, like I said, it's my duty to do right. And so I wasn't going to not put 110% effort into it. And I had to learn. So I basically, over the next six months, became quite educated on IP law and figuring out kind of everything and working with the best attorneys. And we found the best people and working through the rebranding process and kind of going through discovery of what is a brand. You know, like when I started it, I kind of just picked a name that I liked. And yeah, we filed trademarks. We did all the right things, but I didn't do any diligence to see if there were other brands using similar names. And so this time around, I had to be like, what's a brand name that could champion a business going forward? We've been in business for five years. People know about us. It's not a massive business, but it's growing. And what's one that's protectable? And you've got a timeline because you've got a person on the other side saying, change your name by this date or we're going to sue you. And it's just like, so you got a gun to your head and you've got this huge list of things you need to accomplish. And it was incredibly daunting. And this was the one time I had no one else to lean on. Like my team couldn't do this for me. Investors couldn't. I had to do all of it and kind of absorb all of the stress work directly with the, like, I don't have a, like, I didn't have a co-founder or an operating partner at that level. So like, it's me on email chain with all the attorneys understanding all the complexities of it and then figuring out how are we going to go down this process and so yeah it was ultimately The stress of that and but like i said now kind of a few years removed i'm incredibly thankful for that period i just like learned so much like the buyout of my co-founder that was kind of What i coined as like 150 grand that was my mba i learned so much during that process just around what is a shareholder agreement what's the importance of it like around co-founder dynamics And values and buyouts and the way we had to do everything. I learned so much at that period. This was now another learning opportunity of like, oh, okay, we're operating in a different league now where like this is a thing and people, you have to play a little bit of defense. People are going to throw, like shoot arrows at you, you know? And so that was an arrow and ultimately I let the second arrow hit me which was my reaction right you have the first arrow which you can't control the second arrow is like how you deal with It and I forget where I'm quoting that from but someone says that I loved it because it's like you can choose not to get by the second arrow and I chose to kind of like not do the right things In terms of taking care of myself I give myself grace now because I didn't know any better I didn't have protocols built I didn't know I was going to get burned out because similar to work-life Balance, I believe burnout is the result of working a lot on things that don't fill your cup, that are out of line with your mission. It's not from overworking. The common thing is like, oh, if you work 80 hours a week, you're going to burn out. It's not true. I can work 80 hours, 100 hours a week on things I love and feel very energized and excited and you're obsessed with it. But working that 80 hours on this legal stuff, which was completely counter to what I wanted to do in our mission, it was such a distraction and a sideshow.
  Speaker 2
  And it's draining.
  Speaker 1
  It was incredibly draining. The stress, the anxiety around it. I smile, right? Because it's just like, if I think back, there's so many incredible stories and it was just like such a rewarding thing to go through knowing we've been on the other side and we've now Under our new name Outweigh sold more product than we did ever as our old name. But like, it just, it was incredibly difficult.
  Speaker 2
  It goes to show you that like, as you get more successful, you start to attract attention. And a lot of people like to compete with lawyers instead of product.
  Speaker 1
  That's the losing mindset. Those people that are doing that are like operating from a place of fear and they're playing more defense than offense. And that's not how I like to operate. I'm much more of a friends i... ([Time 0:52:00](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a438164c-8fe8-4837-bb53-070693dffab7))
    - **Note:** Dealing with existential issues at work. Perception vs interpretation. He grew through hardship. Brand is the essence of the company it’s how you make someone feel. Value of a brand. Understanding who you are. Don’t be lonely tap into support from others. Realizing that trauma makes you stronger. You don’t always need to do and work balls to the wall. You need to find the work style that fits your job. Early that is working your ass off but later it becomes looking 6-12 months out and making creative strategic decisions. Getting more isn’t doing more it’s more focus. Do your best opportunity don’t chase a silver bullet. The score takes care of itself. Lack of patience changes the outcome.
- Embrace Authenticity and Celebrate the Journey
  Summary:
  Engaging in self-reflective processes helps uncover personal motivations and strengths, leading to a deeper understanding of authenticity.
  Recognizing the impact of external opinions on self-worth is crucial; it limits personal freedom and the ability to express genuine thoughts. Cultivating the habit of questioning moments of self-moderation fosters accountability and encourages honest expression in interactions.
  Embracing personal passions—no matter how trivial they may seem—reinforces self-acceptance and diminishes the influence of societal judgments.
  It's important to celebrate present moments and experiences, as they contribute to lasting fulfillment rather than merely chasing future goals.
  Balancing ambition with contentment is essential to live authentically; one can strive for more while appreciating current achievements. This awareness leads to resilience, focusing on personal missions and staying grounded in authenticity amidst external pressures.

  Speaker 1
  And he mentioned this guy, Jack Skeen, who does this roadmap process where Andrew had done it and a few other people in the business community had done it. And it's this kind of extensive process where you work with Jack and you do some clinical kind of like psychology tests, understand kind of your tendencies. And he does interviews of your close friends and family, people that have opted in to being around you, for the most part, they see something in you. And then interview calls and coaching calls with him. And the goal of that is to kind of understand yourself better and understand, you know, what your superpower is. And I didn't go into it with the goal of trying to care less about what people think. That was an outcome of the process. I actually didn't know what to expect. I just knew that I wanted to be taken apart and put back together. I wanted to actually, piece by piece, really understand myself. I wanted to dig into the childhood and be like, what does drive me? Why do I do the things I do? Why am I so intense? Why do I have these goals and need to achieve them? Why are my expectations so high? A lot of why I was moving through the world was acceptance and caring about what people thought, like attaching my worth to how other people thought about me. And that was a really unique insight of just like, I wasn't living authentically, you know, and I was kind of limited by the belief of others. I never really struggled with caring what people think, unless I like admired them or cared about their opinion. And I think it's important to like prioritize what people you care about think, but that can't limit you and it can't change, you know, what you feel is right and what you need to do as well. And so going through that process and building the systems and kind of building the understanding of how do you deal with that? Like one thing I did daily is I'll kind of like do some journaling and I just started asking myself every day, when did I not say or do what I was really thinking or feeling? Because I didn't want to moderate myself anymore. That's not to say be rude, but it's not to, like, if we're having a conversation and I disagree, like, I want to be more willing to say that because I don't want to have a fear of thinking That the other person across the table is going to not like me anymore because I disagree. It's like, is that a good friendship anyways? It sounds obvious, but a lot of people operate that way, right? It's very natural to like want to fit in and want to kind of be accepted. And so it can be a bit scary to kind of like be really authentic.
  Speaker 2
  And it causes a resentment if you're holding that in. Well, totally.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah. It's exhausting, right? Because you're actually not living your true self. You're like a chameleon. And that's where a lot of people who think they may be introverted, I think, are just actually limiting a lot. They're just kind of molding to their environment. And that's why they're so exhausted after this. They're just around the wrong people or they're not being authentic. So learning strategies on how not to care, that's a lot easier said than done. But asking myself that question and kind of knowing I have to be accountable to that allows me to be more authentic because I don't't want to answer that question but here's where I moderated Myself and I'm happy to say like I've only like once in a couple months had to like answer that question and and not uh it'd be like yeah I moderate myself here um it was just out of fear it Was like a public speaking I didn't want to get up and talk it's like it's like I don't know I cared what people thought for some reason it kind of affected me. Outside of not caring what people think, the real kind of unlock there was, I said, superpower. And it came down that my love and appreciation for socks and the utility and how they can improve what I see there and learning how that can be enough. Learning that, like I mentioned earlier, I was insecure about socks being enough. I do now feel I'm in a spot where I know a lot about business. I've got a lot of experience. I kind of had this angst of like, are socks the best utilization of these skills that I've built? And I kind of mentioned that to Jack. He's like, well, that's kind of silly. If you're doing shoes, would that be enough? What about tennis rackets? And I was like, oh, I've never thought about it that way. I was like, Nike's a great business, right? It was shoes for such a long time. I was like, no one ever was like, that's a lame business, right? I was like, socks. I've mentioned a couple of times, it's a big market. I was like, why isn't this enough? Why in my head are socks not as good as shoes or rackets or some tech thing? It's like, it was just this kind of like self-imposed sort of limiter of like, I don't know, of like, I guess caring what people think because I don't have a better idea right now and I really Love what I do. And so it was really helpful to understand that because it, like I said, it helped me. I was already falling back in love with kind of the process, but it was like, it almost allowed me me to kind of like fully commit to it again and be like, oh no, socks are enough until the Next idea comes. I kind of challenged him because I was like, oh, I did all this work and like, socks are my superpower. And he's like, no, they are right now. Your ability to like take a product and see how it can be improved is your superpower, but you don't have another product in mind right now. He's like, that will come and you'll know when it comes. He's like, be okay with where you are. And that's been a kind of theme for me is, I got to see the feedback and read the report. And one of the things that Rob tries to rush through life and I do, I'm always onto the next thing. I don't celebrate the wins. And it's just like, I'm trying to rush to the next thing. And it's like, as I get older too, and I'm trying to appreciate the moments and smell the roses. And a good example of this is when I was cycling, I got to travel the world and see all these incredible places. I was so intense and so focused that I would not enjoy anywhere. I'd be in Spain or Italy, and I would be so tunnel visioned that I didn't even give myself time to appreciate where I was. And I always told myself, I'll be back. I'll appreciate it later. I haven't been back. It just ended. And I look back, I'm like, I think I would be a lot more fulfilled if I actually just smelt the roses. Because the results are one thing, but the experiences and the opportunities to be there., we always look back and like, we don't talk about the results. We talk about the experiences and the journey. And unfortunately I just like, didn't take time to appreciate the journey. And so I'm really trying to do that now. And, you know, it's just way more fulfilling to be like, we're in it. One of my favorite quotes is one of my favorite shows, the office. And it's like the final episode. And Andy says, he's kind of reminiscing. He's like, I wish someone told us we were in the good times, like in th... ([Time 1:28:04](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ad570f70-42ff-4760-8e12-1612ace4ed47))
    - **Note:** Learning and discovering who you are what drives you and how to do that. Missing the good old days. Being authentic to yourself. Enjoying the moment not getting too caught up in the nonsense. You’ll regret the day you can’t take your dog for a walk in the rain more than hating it today. Love the moments love life. Understand yourself this is all we have. Love the journey.
