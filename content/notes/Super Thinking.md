### Highlights

- “The best time to plant a tree was twenty years ago. The second best time is now.” ([Location 140](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J83WR&location=140))
    - **Tags:** #best-time-to-plant-tree-20-years/-today
- The concept of inverse thinking can help you with the challenge of making good decisions. The inverse of being right more is being wrong less. ([Location 153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J83WR&location=153))
    - **Tags:** #inversion
- unforced error ([Location 157](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J83WR&location=157))
- Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better. ([Location 172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J83WR&location=172))
    - **Tags:** #antifragile
- Ultimately, to be wrong less, you also need to be testing your assumptions in the real world, a process known as de-risking. ([Location 226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J83WR&location=226))
    - **Tags:** #test-assumptions
- premature optimization, where you tweak or perfect code or algorithms (optimize) too early (prematurely). If your assumptions turn out to be wrong, you’re going to have to throw out all that work, rendering it ultimately a waste of time.

- mental model to help you test your assumptions, called minimum viable product, or MVP. ([Location 257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J83WR&location=257))
    - **Tags:** #mvp
- “Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.” No matter the context, what they’re all saying is that your first plan is probably wrong. ([Location 262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J83WR&location=262))

- second fallacy is overfitting, a concept from statistics. Adding in all those overly specific dating requirements is ([Location 305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J83WR&location=305))
- Overfitting occurs when you use an overly complicated explanation when a simpler one will ([Location 309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J83WR&location=309))
- KISS: Keep It Simple, Stupid! When crafting a solution to a problem, whether making a decision or explaining data, you want to start with the simplest set of assumptions you can think of and de-risk them as simply as possible. ([Location 316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J83WR&location=316))

    - **Note:** See others perspective
- frame-of-reference mental trap (or useful trick, depending on your perspective) is framing. ([Location 329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J83WR&location=329))
- family members and coworkers are constantly framing ([Location 336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J83WR&location=336))

    - **Tags:** #availability-heuristic
- With the rise of personalized recommendations and news feeds on the internet, availability bias has become a more and more pernicious problem. Online this model is called the filter bubble, ([Location 407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J83WR&location=407))
    - **Tags:** #availability-heuristic, #echo-chamber, #bias-(engrained/unnoticed)

- When you put many similar filter bubbles together, you get echo chambers, where the same ideas seem to bounce around the same groups of people, echoing around the collective chambers ([Location 419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J83WR&location=419))
- to be wrong less when thinking about people, you must find ways to increase your empathy, opening up a deeper understanding of what other people are really thinking. This section explores various mental models to help you do just that. ([Location 430](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J83WR&location=430))

- empathize is the most respectful interpretation, or MRI. In any situation, you can explain a person’s behavior in many ways. MRI asks you to you interpret the other parties’ actions in the most respectful way possible. It’s giving people the benefit of the doubt.

- fundamental attribution error, where you frequently make errors by attributing others’ behaviors to their internal, or fundamental, motivations rather than external ([Location 465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J83WR&location=465))
- You of course tend to view your own behavior in the opposite way, which is called self-serving bias. When you are the actor, you often have self-serving reasons for your behavior, but when you are the observer, you tend to blame the other’s intrinsic nature.

- Speaking of privilege, we (the authors) often say we are lucky to have won the birth lottery. Not only were we not born into slavery, but we were also not born into almost any disadvantaged group. At birth, we were no more deserving of an easier run at life than a child who was born into poverty, ([Location 485](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J83WR&location=485))

- You should also keep in mind that the model of learned helplessness can make it hard for some people to strive for improvement without some assistance. Learned helplessness describes the tendency to stop trying to escape difficult situations because we have gotten used to difficult conditions over time. Someone learns that they are helpless to control their circumstances, so they give up trying to change them. ([Location 495](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J83WR&location=495))

- paradigm shift model, describing how accepted scientific theories change over time. Instead of a gradual, evolving progression, Kuhn describes a bumpy, messy process in which initial problems with a scientific theory are either ignored or rationalized away.

- However, they both noticed obvious and important empirical truths that should have been investigated by other scientists but were reflexively rejected by these scientists because the suggested explanations were not in line with the conventional thinking of the time. Today, this is known as a Semmelweis reflex. ([Location 558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J83WR&location=558))
- The human tendency to gather and interpret new information in a biased way to confirm preexisting beliefs is called confirmation bias. ([Location 562](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J83WR&location=562))
    - **Tags:** #confirmation-bias
- Confirmation bias is so hard to overcome that there is a related model called the backfire effect that describes the phenomenon of digging in further on a position when faced with clear evidence that disproves it.

- cognitive dissonance, the stress felt by holding two contradictory, dissonant, beliefs at once. Scientists have actually linked cognitive dissonance to a physical area in the brain that plays a role in helping you avoid aversive outcomes. Instead of dealing with the underlying cause of this stress—the fact that we might actually be wrong—we take the easy way out and rationalize the conflicting information away. It’s a survival instinct! ([Location 581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J83WR&location=581))

    - **Note:** Cognitive dissidents, instead of recognizing were wrong, use mental gymnastics to make us feel like we’re right when we’re clearly wrong
- First, consider thinking gray, a concept we learned from Steven Sample’s book The Contrarian’s Guide to Leadership. You may think about issues in terms of black and white, but the truth is somewhere in between, a shade of gray.

- William Lloyd described a similar, but hypothetical, overgrazing scenario, now called the tragedy of the commons. ([Location 724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J83WR&location=724))
    - **Tags:** #tragedy-of-the-commons

    - **Tags:** #tyranny-of-the-minority
- tyranny of small decisions can be avoided when someone who has a view over the whole system can veto or curb particular individual decisions when broad negative impacts can be foreseen. ([Location 747](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J83WR&location=747))
    - **Note:** Second level thinking
- Another cause of issues like the tragedy of the commons is the free rider problem, where some people get a free ride by using a resource without paying for it. ([Location 753](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J83WR&location=753))
    - **Tags:** #tragedy-of-the-commons

    - **Tags:** #herd-immunity
- In this example, the public good is a disease-free environment due to herd immunity, and the free riders are those who take advantage of this public good by not getting vaccinated. The tyranny of small decisions can arise when enough individuals choose not to get vaccinated, resulting in an outbreak of the disease, creating a tragedy of the commons.

- Coase theorem, essentially a description of how a natural marketplace can internalize a negative externality. ([Location 835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J83WR&location=835))
- When these conditions are met, entities surrounding the externality will transact among themselves until the extra costs are internalized. ([Location 839](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J83WR&location=839))
- moral hazard, is where you take on more risk, or hazard, once you have information that encourages you to believe you are more protected. ([Location 857](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J83WR&location=857))

    - **Tags:** #goodhart's-law
- Both describe the same basic phenomenon: When you try to incentivize behavior by setting a measurable target, people focus primarily on achieving that measure, often in ways you didn’t intend. Most importantly, their focus on the measure may not correlate to the behavior you hoped to promote. High-stakes testing culture—be it for school examinations, job interviews, or professional licensing—creates perverse incentives to “teach to the test,” or worse, cheat.

- From finance, short-termism describes these types of situations, when you focus on short-term results, such as quarterly earnings, over long-term results, such as five-year profits. ([Location 1064](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J83WR&location=1064))
    - **Tags:** #long/short-term-incentive-misalignment
- The software industry has a name for the consequences of short-termism: technical debt. The idea comes from writing code: if you prioritize short-term code fixes, or “hacks,” over long-term, well-designed code and processes, then you accumulate debt that will eventually have to be paid down by future code rewrites and refactors.

- The general model for this impact comes from economics and is called path dependence, meaning that the set of decisions, or paths, available to you now is dependent on your past decisions. ([Location 1088](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J83WR&location=1088))
    - **Tags:** #path-dependence
    - **Note:** Preserve optionality
- For any decision, ask yourself: What kind of debt am I incurring by doing this? What future paths am I taking away by my actions today? Another model from economics offers some reprieve from the limitations of path dependence: preserving optionality.
