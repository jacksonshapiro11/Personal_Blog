  Speaker 1
  Buffet says, you really should understand human behavior if you're going to run a business. Munger says, once you have the ideas, of course, you must continuously practice, amen, something you and I talk about over and over again. Once you have the ideas, of course, you must continuously practice their use. If you don't practice, you can't perform well. A wise man engaged in learning some important skill will not stop until he is really fluent in it. So more on this idea of it's really important if you're going to run a business to understand human nature. Again, this is all these ideas. These are not on the same page. So this is how you know it's important to them because what's important to people, they will repeat. And so this is really, it's a story about imitation is the note that I left myself when I read this. But no, with Charlie's about to tell us, he's telling us a story about human nature. That's very fascinating. And if you think about like their bird's eye view that they've had in the like the finance industry, which, you know, it's been full of panics and bubbles and booms and busts, right? This is just absolutely fantastic. So Charlie Munger says, one of my favorite stories is about the little boy in Texas. The teacher asked the class, if there are nine sheep in the pen and one jumps out, how many are left? And everybody got the answer right, except this little boy who said, none of them are left. And the teacher said, you don't understand arithmetic. And he said, no teacher, you don't understand sheep. And Buffett adds on to the story by saying, it always amazes me how high IQ people mindlessly imitate. And then Buffett describes this phenomenon by this idea. He calls the three eyes. And so he says, you get what I call the natural progression, the three eyes, the innovators, the imitators, and the idiots. So skipping ahead, let's go back to this idea that they repeat over and over again. Spend a lot of time thinking, reading, formulating your own thoughts and mute the world. And so Buffett says, we do not read other people's opinions. We want to think. We want to get the facts and then think. This was such a like a mind blowing realization. Because you never know when like when you're reading something, when it just, it's going to something click or like kind of interact with maybe an idea that was previous in your mind or you didn't, you didn't, weren't necessarily like completely understood how important it was.

    - **Note:** Mindless inmatation and understanding sheep. 1 sheep hops out you don’t have 9 but zero. Get the facts then think.
