  That's the first bit. The second piece was just all about the people involved. So it's you identify the market, the wave of change. And you try to go out and identify the companies that are best positioned to take advantage of that. The challenge there is twofold. One, you got to execute and get in there because the best companies always have their choice of why they take capital from others. And then you've really got to understand the people involved. That was where the art was for him was the understanding the people and the keys to that were did they understand how to build a culture of attracting, retaining people. And I said that earlier, but for him, a lot of that came down to was the CEO, an A player willing to hire other a players and delegate.

But the best companies, and if you look at the best ones over time that he's invested in that we've invested in, it's been the ones run by CEOs management teams that it's just strength On strength on strength across the board. And from a leadership perspective down, there's just an expectation that this is a team effort over time. So those are some of the pieces to it.

Don’t own stock but they’re a partner in the business they come in respect others and come in very prepared. First meeting is about who the ceo is what they’re trying to build what they’re about because you can’t get that first meeting back. Understand the person above all. What are you trying to build here was his biggest question and priorities not about business model. He was focused on spending time with people and those relationships not the returns.
