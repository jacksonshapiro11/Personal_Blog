### Highlights

- Episode AI notes
  1. Human beings have two selves: an essence and a social mask that forms as they grow and interact in society, limiting their ability to explore experiences outside societal norms.
  2. True ethical behavior involves recognizing and accepting the dark side of human nature, understanding that it encompasses both good and dark aspects.
  3. Mastery is the ultimate level of expertise where ideas come naturally without conscious thought, achieved through deep understanding and immersion in the subject.
  4. Observing others and immersing oneself in external experiences can lead to personal growth, improved social interactions, and a deeper understanding of the world around them. ([Time 0:00:00](https://share.snipd.com/episode-takeaways/3e97eaf6-eb03-4916-86be-65f39bf2ee28))
- We live these lives with masks on constantly and we don’t even realize we are it obscures who we are we need to remove the mask. Treat life like a game. Becoming yourself vs your mask. Find sublime experiences that transcend the mask and get you to tap in deeper to who we are. Power is having a degree of control over the events of your life despite being full of randomness and controlling yourself. A greater margin of control. True power is keeping it and changing with the times. Some people rise to power because of the zeitgeist of the time but others can switch sides to keep power that is true power. Don’t get typecast play with your masks. Aware you’re performing and change the roles you play. Social media doesn’t alter human nature it emphasizes them even more.

    - **Note:** We live life with a mask on and it’s on us to transcend the mask and be our true selves every day. Power is having as much control over your life as possible it’s agency maybe you can only control 5% but in that 5% you can do anything controlling yourself. True power transcends traditional boundaries like ruling parties and movements real power is being in charge across all movements. Don’t get typecast play with your mask explore roles. Tech emphasizes human nature. Discover your thick desire.
      We all have masks power is agency power transcends masks.
- Embracing the Dark Side of Human Nature
  Summary:
  Human beings have a dark side, known as the 'shadow,' which encompasses our ugliest desires, competitive instincts, ambition, and even desires to hurt others.
  Emotions are never pure, and we all have moments of hostility even towards loved ones. True ethical behavior involves recognizing and accepting this dark side, rather than pretending to be virtuous.
  True virtue comes from self-awareness of both the good and dark sides of oneself, understanding that human nature encompasses both aspects.

  Speaker 1
  There might be, who knows, as far as I know. So personally, I like to not engage in a lot of those things. I'm revealing what other people do. But on the other hand, it's something that I wrote about in my book on human nature. We all have a dark side. We all have a shadow, what Jung would call the shadow. And a lot of us, the game that we play, we try and repress it. We try not to show any of it in public. It can be our ugliest desires, our competitive instincts, our ambition, even our desires to hurt people, our ambivalence. People have this notion that when we feel an emotion or even somebody we love, it's like this pure thing, but emotions are never pure. We're always ambivalent. So even our parents or our loved ones, we have little elements of hostility. We still have moments of that. So we have a dark side, and yet we don't want to admit it. So what annoys me are people trying to pretend that they're these saints, that they're these virtuous people. But the dark side, people who pretend the most, the dark side leaks out and all kinds of their behavior. So to me, to be a truly, quote unquote, ethical human being, if there is such a thing, is to recognize to be a self -aware that you're not as good as you think you are. You're not as virtuous, you're not as saintly, that you have a dark, maybe even an evil side to you, because that is human nature. That is how we're born. That is who we are. So I'm not going to wrestle with what exactly is good or what exactly is evil, but I do think true virtue, if you will, comes from awareness of your complete self, your good side and your Dark side as well.
  Speaker 2
  JS To take one of your ideas from earlier that the Zeitgeist today is so much about algorithms, and obviously with artificial intelligence, which I'm super curious for your read on, Just watching this get built and unfold up against all the research you've done, you would program an algorithm to be seductive?

    - **Note:** True awareness comes from understanding your good side and your dark side none of us are perfect people fake it but better to understand it and live with it. Know the dark side. Accept everyone is a golden mean of good and bad
- Mastery: The Ultimate Level of Expertise
  Summary:
  Mastery is the ultimate level of expertise where ideas come naturally without the need for conscious thought.
  It involves internalizing the subject matter to the point where the external world lives inside of you. This state is achieved when rational thinking is combined with intuition, transcending traditional levels of creativity.
  The mastery allows individuals to operate on a higher level where they effortlessly interact with their field, be it music, sports, or any other domain.
  It is described as a powerful state that goes beyond mere skill and requires deep understanding and immersion in the subject.
  By attaining mastery, individuals tap into the superpower of the human brain, experiencing a sense of exhilaration and ease in their pursuits.

  Speaker 1
  And his seduction attempts, he uses all the tricks, they're not working because she sees through and he's getting so frustrated. Finally, he reaches a point where he finds himself actually falling in love with her because he's tried so hard. It's never happened to him before. He's never let his emotions run. And the moment he falls in love with her, she starts falling for him. So the lesson I glean from that is, you have to have some of the emotions that you're trying to inject in the other person, yourself as well. And people are not good at that. They're too in their heads. And seduction is a game where you're getting out of your head into your body and playing this mating ritual that I don't think AI could ever achieve.
  Speaker 2
  JS I think that your very first law of power is to not outshine the master, which makes me think of just mastery in general. And I'd love you to define mastery. You wrote a whole book about it. It's one of my favorite things you've written. I think you define it as finding your life's task. It's one of the steps. We talk a lot about life's work and what we do, which I think are very similar concepts. What is mastery to you? What is it and why is it worth pursuing?
  Speaker 1
  Well, I have six chapters that are like these steps upward to this ultimate state, which I call mastery. And the level before that is creativity. And creativity is gold. It's like the philosopher's stone. If you're a creative person, you'll be successful in whatever event you do because you will always be coming up with new ideas, novel associations. But mastery is one step above that. And it's where you have this feel for your subject, for your field, for whatever it is. You don't have to think. Ideas come to you. You've internalized the whole world that you're doing. So you're thinking faster, you're on another level. And I give examples of people who play the piano who've been practicing for so long, but they don't have to think anymore. And they're interacting with the keyboard, they become the keyboard. So it's almost, I say it's mixing the rational with the intuitive. It's mixing the outside with the inside. You master a chess. That chessboard lives inside of you. Outside, it's inside of you. You're a great soccer player like Pele or Neymar or whomever. The field is out there, but it's inside your head. You've internalized it. So I call it this inside out phenomenon where the external world is now living inside of you. And when you reach that level, it's almost woo woo. It's hard to even verbalize, but I tried in that chapter to explain it, that you don't have to think anymore. Things come to you, and it's the most exciting sensation that you can have. So I wanted to give people the idea that this is a power. We're so interested in superpowers and Marvel comics and things that don't exist at all, they're pure fantasy. But the human brain has a superpower. This is it. It's an incredible instrument that we all have. And I wanted to interest people in attaining that level because they don't think about it. They think of hacking their way to something, to just finding tricks, to how to fake being good at something or whatever. ([Time 0:37:31](https://share.snipd.com/snip/080abfa8-8b93-4440-8a90-c68c00dff614))
    - **Note:** Mastery one step above creativity where you’re transcending paradigms. You don’t have to think what you’re doing is an extension of yourself things come to you. Mastery is finding what makes you different and that makes you one of a kind and pursuing that not letting the world change you but being yourself. Find your life’s task and why you’re different. Find what you love and hate investigate yourself deeply to find what works. Follow what gives you energy. You need to love it because when it gets hard if you don’t love it you’ll quit. Most people struggle because they can’t deal with rejection and failure and if you don’t love it you’ll let that failure consume you most of success is pushing through the failures others couldn’t. Mastery of human nature comes from constant socializing.
- Observation and Understanding of Human Nature in Literature and Psychology
  Summary:
  Authors like Jane Austen, George Eliot, and Marcel Proust excelled at dissecting human nature and psychology in their works due to their deep understanding of social interactions prevalent in the 19th century.
  These writers were keen observers of human behavior, a trait essential for understanding human nature. In modern times, the art of socializing and observing others has dwindled, leading to a lack of depth in contemporary literature.
  Similarly, figures like Chekhov and Milton Erickson, the founder of hypnotherapy, displayed exceptional insights into human nature by being non-judgmental observers of people's behavior and nonverbal communication.
  Erickson, who overcame paralysis and mastered nonverbal communication, demonstrated the power of understanding human behavior beyond words, showcasing how deep observation and empathy can unveil hidden truths about individuals.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  What other people that have gone on a similar path have impressed you the most with the way that they frame their understanding of human nature?
  Speaker 1
  Well, I must say one of the most brilliant people dissecting human nature and social codes was the writer Jane Austen. And a lot of the reason is, and a lot of 19th -century novelists were some of the most brilliant people at dissecting human nature, Adolst, Stegas, Jane Austen, George Eliot, a Flaubert, Et cetera. Marcel Proust was one of the greatest ever, is because these worlds, as opposed to our modern world, people were incredibly social. So imagine, put yourself in their shoes. You don't have the internet. You don't have television. You don't have film. You have theater and you have live musical performances, but they're very rare. If you were a modern person, God, you'd be bored stiff. You know, yeah, you had books, that's true. The main form was socialize. You were continually socializing. You were playing cards. You were going to parties. You were dancing. You were listening to music. You were never stuck in your home with your phone or whatever. You were out there socializing. People, people, people, people. And when you have a young woman who's very sensitive, as women can be, who are very empathetic to other people's energy, and they're socializing. Since the day they were a young girl, they're in their 20s and 30s, they're going to have a grasp of human nature, of human psychology that's on another level because they've been practicing, They've been observing. So writers, I know this for myself, although I don't write fiction, to be a writer, you have to be a master observer of people's character. And we've lost that now. We're novelists now. They're not really so into the social. They don't understand it nearly as well as we did because they're not doing it. So some of the people like Chekhov. Chekhov was absolutely brilliant at understanding human nature, mostly because this is the other quality in writers. They're non -judgmental. Not all writers are like that, but the best writers are depicting humans as they are, as they wish them to be, ballsack, et cetera, et cetera. So you're non -judgmental, you're looking at people as they are, you're observing them intensely on and on and on for years and years and years. That is to me are the master players to understanding human nature. Of course, psychiatrists, psychologists who deal with patients day in and day out, and individuals, they also like a Jung or a Freud or an Alfred Adler or a Kohut, they can also reach That high level as well. Are Milton Erickson one of my icons?
  Speaker 2
  What about Erickson? Why is he an icon for you? What did you learn from him?
  Speaker 1
  So he's a standard has been through all of my books. The reason I love Milton Erickson, he's supposedly the inspiration behind NLP, but that's a bit dubious, but really he's the founder of hypnotherapy. But Erickson, as I described in the Lost of Human Nature, came down with polio at the age of 17 or so, and he was completely paralyzed except for his eyeballs. So during the two years that he had to try and recover, he became a master observer of people's nonverbal communication, because that's all he had. It's the only entertainment he could read, he couldn't watch anything, he couldn't go outside. So his sisters mostly were coming in this room and entertaining. He observed every little aspect of their behavior. And he could decode it like he had learned French. He spoke it fluently. And then he became a psychologist. And unlike the talking therapist, he wasn't interested in hearing about your childhood. He was interested in how you moved your body when you talked about your childhood, how your eyes reflect. He watched how people walked into the room. He watched how tight their body was. There was one woman sitting in his chair undergoing therapy. She was going on about her problems and he goes, you know what? I know what your real problem is. She goes, what? He goes, you're having an affair? Wow, how did you know that? He goes, the way your body is, the way you're in this locked position, I could just tell the way you're crossing your feet. That's a power that he had uniquely, but it's a power that humans can have when you understand nonverbal communication. He was also just a really thinker about human behavior, and he was also one of those non -judgmental people. And he had amazing stories of how he cured people, not just talking, but through actions, et cetera. He had one person who is insane, who is in a mental institution. He had been a successful person, but he went crazy. ([Time 0:51:47](https://share.snipd.com/snip/471104da-82d9-48e0-b899-34e1bfa040f4))
    - **Note:** Best observers of human nature observe the world and people how they are not how they want it to be. Understand human nature through actions and non judgement. Mastery is about self absorption and seeing the world.
- Get Outside Yourself and Observe the World
  Summary:
  The key challenge is to break free from self-absorption by observing others.
  Immersing oneself in external experiences by observing people, animals, or nature can lead to personal growth and mastery. By making the external world part of oneself, individuals can overcome self-centeredness, improve social interactions, and develop a deeper understanding of the world around them.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  If you could take everything you've studied and learned and applied yourself and turn it into a challenge to be issued to people listening, how would you do that? What would you challenge people to do?
  Speaker 1
  I would challenge people to get outside of themselves and to be more observant. We're all too locked inside of our own worlds, inside of our own obsessions, our own problems, particularly it's a real problem now. It's been documented how levels of self -absorption are increasing. The best therapy of all is to get outside of your own brain and to get inside the world of other people and to observe them. It could be observing animals. It could be observing protozoa. It could be observing plants. I I don't care. Get outside of yourself and get into the external world and immerse your spirit and your mind and your body and your brain into something else and to try and enter into it. I said before, mastery is making the outside into the inside. I call it inside out. So you want to feel it, but first, you have to get outside of your brain and into that world and other people and other animals. That to me is the best advice. It's what all my books are about is observing people is not being self -absorbed to the point where you do talk more than necessary, where you do have these faults that I mentioned, that You are an anti -seducer, that you're a bad strategist, that you are fearful because there's the 50 Cent book, that you think that mastery is only for certain people. It's just about getting outside of yourself and observing the world. ([Time 0:56:25](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2386f176-35f9-4231-9fc2-a9eb6d07015c))
    - **Note:** Get outside yourself and see the world and become a keen observer of human and animal nature. Just sit and watch the world as it is. Give yourself up and feel the world. Get outside of yourself and emerse your spirit into something else.
