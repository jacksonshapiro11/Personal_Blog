- Focus on the Jewel to Flourish
  Summary:
  Successful companies often harbor a core strength or 'jewel' that can become overshadowed by less successful ventures, leading to diminished overall performance.
  It is essential for management to recognize and streamline their focus on this core asset. Historical examples, such as Coca-Cola in the 1980s and advice from Steve Jobs to Nike's former CEO, illustrate the significance of cutting out underperforming parts of a business to enhance value.
  Concentrating efforts on what truly works can lead to remarkable results, as seen in Coca-Cola's stock increase after shedding its less effective subsidiaries.

  He says, this often works because there's normally a jewel at the heart of most companies that has often been used to fund new ventures, that jewels been taken for granted by inpatient Management. As the JUUL becomes deluded by less successful projects, aggregate performance declines. And so Nick talks about the fact that Munger and Buffett saw this in Coca-Cola in the mid-1980s, because at that time, Coca-Cola had become a poorly defined conglomerate, including A shrimp farm, winery, and a film studio. As the poor businesses were cut away to reveal the jewel that is syrup manufacturing and marketing operation, the shares of Coca-Cola rose over 10 fold in the succeeding decade. There's a hilarious story that comes to mind when the Mark Parker, who's the former CEO of Nike asked Steve Jobs if he had any advice for him. And Steve said, Nike makes some of the best products in the world, products that you lust after. They're absolutely beautiful, stunning products, but you also make a lot of crap. Just get rid of the crappy stuff and focus on the good stuff. Just get rid of the crappy stuff and focus on the good stuff. This idea that a jewel can become diluted by less successful projects as aggregate performance declines. The reason I started here is because what's fascinating about reading these letters, but also, and I'm going to go through these in chronological order so we can see the evolution of Nick Sleep's thinking, it's also the same phenomenon that you and I see when you go through a biography and you go through somebody's life chronologically. ([Time 0:06:55](https://share.snipd.com/snip/af6c4124-6650-4db8-90c3-95bc7cd8c58e))
    - **Note:** Earned secret in investing. They found businesses with a crown jewel that was getting diluted by ancillary nonsense and when you forget about the nonsense and keep the main thing the main thing you’ll have success. Coke owned a shrimp farm when they divested in all their nonsense the stock 10xed. Focus. As a company have and commit to a common goal. Reading old letters makes you see how thinking evolves. What he was starting to think about in 2001 becomes foundational in his success. What’s best for the company is what’s best for the customer. If you serve the customer constantly you’ll win. If you even once try to put the company first you’re eroding trust and fucked.
- Focus Multiplies Returns
  Summary:
  Prioritize focusing on the most significant insights or ideas, as they should dominate your efforts due to their transformative potential.
  Dividing attention across multiple tasks decreases overall productivity, yielding diminishing returns. An additional hour devoted to a single project offers greater benefits than spreading efforts thinly across many.
  Therefore, evaluate the opportunity costs of pursuing new endeavors against existing commitments, recognizing that only highly valuable new areas warrant the diversion of focus.
  Concentrated effort in a few domains can lead to substantial success, as demonstrated by examples like investing heavily in a single stock.

  So the first thing is keep the thing the importance of keeping the main thing the main thing the importance of focusing and concentrating. And that is related to part two, which is one of my favorite ideas when they knew that they had uncovered a deep truth. And Nick says, if it's the single best thought you have ever had in your life, it needs to dominate everything, because you're not going to get many insights like that. And if it's your single best insight, your single best idea, then obviously it's what you're spending all your time on. There is a post written by one of the co-founders of Palantir. It talks about what he learned from working with Peter Thiel. And this part of the post I have saved on my phone, and I think it applies to exactly what's taking place here. Do not divide your attention. Focusing on one thing yields increasing returns for each unit of effort. At a micro level, an extra hour of focus on the current project has a much higher return than an hour on something new, or worse, five minutes each on 12 new things. Before you ever do something new, you should understand the opportunity cost versus existing things. Don't rationalize that something you want to do is complementary when it's not. At a macro level, understanding that applied effort has a convex output curve is a very useful discipline when considering new market areas. This convexity means that the opportunity cost of transferring resources from existing projects to new ones is high. Unless the new area is incredibly valuable, anything we can do to extend an existing convex curve is worth so much more. And so towards the end of the partnership, they're known for their heavy concentration in just three things. And like you and I talked about last week, in one case, 70% of their net worth, I think this was Zach's net worth, 70% of Zach's net worth was in Amazon, just one stock. ([Time 0:15:06](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e6d632e3-a8bb-453a-9ab2-0633e1a9932a))
    - **Note:** Deep focus concentrate don’t diversify you don’t have time.
- Invest Wisely, Wait Patiently
  Summary:
  Investing in the right companies requires a focus on those that are not only effective but also genuinely motivated to succeed.
  The emphasis is on building a 'terminal portfolio' that aligns with these positively driven, compounding businesses. Companies that behave well must genuinely want to excel, as opposed to merely having to due to external pressures.
  Identifying early-stage opportunities among these quality businesses, like Costco and Amazon, can yield significant long-term benefits.
  Time acts as an ally for robust companies, accelerating their potential while hampering mediocre ones.
  To prepare for advantageous pricing, investors must engage in extensive research and analysis now, ensuring readiness for future opportunities. This preparation involves learning about the business models and recognizing the patterns that distinguish truly exceptional companies. Moreover, awareness of common investment mistakes serves as a critical learning tool, as successful investing remains a rare achievement in the field. Ultimately, patience is key; the diligent preparation today can set the stage for profitable investments tomorrow.

  Honestly run compounding machines. We call this the terminal portfolio. This is where we want to go. The question is, why is this list not the same as the current nomad portfolio? And what I write there is answering the question on the previous page and I wrote fucking bingo on the previous page starting to change their mind when will their actions reflect that He's having a very honest conversation he's like this is the outcome of our own thinking we have this group we've identified a handful of potential honestly run compounding machines This is our terminal portfolio this where we want to go. But then we compare that list to our portfolio, they don't match. And so then Nick elaborates on the honestly run part of this. Now he doesn't want just a compounding machine, he wants an honestly run compounding machine. What does that mean? There are only two reasons, two reasons companies behave well, because they want to and because they have to. Our preference is to invest in those that want to. If we can find enough of these heavenly opportunities, they will in fact put us out of a job. We will be pleased if a little bored." And he arrives at that conclusion because he's like, well, if we can invest in them early, we can invest in Costco and Amazon early. We don't have to do anything else because time is a friend of a good business. In fact, I like the way Buffett put this in his shareholder letters He says time is a friend of the wonderful business and the enemy of the mediocre. And so Nick says, today in 2004, we have made two investments in wonderful compounding machines, and only one of those is meaningful, meaningfully represented in our portfolio. That's Costco. What is the probability that say over the next 10 years a good portion of these super high quality thinkers? Will be priced at 50 cents. So there's some kind of pullback in the stock, right? Our betting is that odds are reasonable. The trick is to do the work today so that we are ready. If you go back to the Leeloo's lecture with the Columbia Business School students, that's what he kept telling them. You have to be a learning machine. You have to be doing the work now. He referenced many times that it takes a long time now, but it makes you go faster later on, but that you'll study something he would study like an American company for like 15 years. It would take him 15 years to find the Asian counterpart. Nick is telling us something very similar here. We're going to think this through. We're going to analyze this business model. We're going to try to find these super high quality thinkers, these compounding machines. And then we are going to be patient. We are going to wait because the probabilities are high, they will be able to get a good price to buy in. The trick is to do the work today so that we are ready. And so in addition to spending time analyzing companies and industries and trying to find these compounding machines, they also talk a lot about or Nick talks a lot about all the mistakes That his peers and other people in the industry make. He says, successful investing is a minority sport. ([Time 0:20:27](https://share.snipd.com/snip/433b8769-8b2d-4c6a-bebf-0fa9036dd80f))
    - **Note:** Find compounding machines and be patient on building a position over time do the thinking up front to wait for the right opportunity so you’re prepared. They want to own compounding machines but they don’t own everything they want. Why is that. Time is the friend of the great business and enemy of the mediocre. Terminal portfolio. Most people can’t think long term enough to be a good investor. Costco low margin is their opportunity. Scale economies shared. The biggest mistake is in the sale too early not holding on too long. The best decision is not a decision at all it’s not selling. Long term view is such an advantage lowering pricing is against math but long term you can’t understand how the goodwill of low prices compounds. Short core optimized but long term its wrong. Math based decisions have answers judgement based decisions don’t but you differentiate through judgement. Judgement is how you win math is how you’re right. Judgement based decisions are controversial but they’re the only ways to grow.
- Invest Like a Founder: Focus on Future Potential
  Summary:
  Investors risk making significant mistakes by selling shares in high-potential companies prematurely.
  Selling Amazon today could mirror the regret of selling Walmart in its early stages. A unique approach to portfolio construction, reminiscent of founder mentality, favors concentrated bets over diversification.
  Historical examples of successful investors like Sam Walton highlight that true wealth accumulation often comes from maintaining stakes in one's own creations without diluting them through diversification.
  Events such as the 2008 financial crisis showcase how businesses with robust underlying strengths, like Amazon, can thrive even during downturns, emphasizing the importance of understanding a company's intrinsic value rather than reacting to market fluctuations.
  Amazon's capacity for sustained growth despite adverse market conditions illustrates how modern competitors struggle against its efficiencies. The narrative warns against the common inclination to diversify as a protective measure, arguing that it may inadvertently increase risk. Recognizing a few critical factors that underpin significant business successes allows for more informed, concentrated investment strategies. Ultimately, this insight advocates for rigorous analysis of potential investment opportunities akin to founding a business, focusing on long-term growth rather than short-term performance.

  Speaker 1
  In previous Nomad letters, we have argued that the biggest error an investor can make is the sale of Walmart or Microsoft in the early stages of the company's growth. We wonder, would selling Amazon today be the equivalent mistake of selling Walmart in 1980? And so he talks about let's invert, let's invert the way to construct a portfolio. The other way to construct a portfolio that's different from how other people do it is to invert and start at 100% waiting and work down. This is what founders do. He's really saying without saying what if you invested like founders invest. Right? It's 100%. Sam Walton's 100% of his net worth was in his company. And he says now we are not advocating all the fund in Amazon. Well, just not yet at least. And here's the crazy thing, that would have been their best performing decision, assuming you're going to put all your money into what you've already invested in. They didn't know it then, obviously, but the best performing decision would have to do just that, allocate the entire fund to Amazon. And he tells a wonderful story why this is so difficult. This is hilarious. He says, it was recently reported that oil had been found not in the far flung reaches of the globe, but under the headquarters of Exxon in Irving, Texas, and not by Exxon. Sometimes what you are looking for is right in front of you. If Exxon can make that mistake, we all can. So now we're in the great financial crisis of 2008. Remember, Nick said the greatest speech on investment wasn't about investment. It was about the psychology of human misjudgment. And he's talking about, you know, everybody's panicking. I think they're going to wind up being down like 40% this year, 45% at the end of the year. And he says in the letters, before this even happens, I think he's only down to 20% this time. He goes, I know it doesn't seem like it, but I promise you this is the best possible time to be an investor. And he's looking at the underlying strength of Amazon. It's completely uncorrelated to stock price, and he cannot believe it. This next section goes over many, many pages. It's one of my favorite parts of his entire letters. And so he's about to make the point using Amazon as an example that, hey, customers respond to incentives like all people do, and Amazon's sharing of these benefits of its scale will Make them grow much farther from here. And you can see it with how they're actually performing in the middle of this great financial crisis that's happening in 2008. And so he's comparing Amazon's strength with the lack of strength that normal retailers have. So he calls them high low, you know, people that say, hey, you know, they get you in the door by essentially heavily discounting having like a loss leader and in the hopes that once you're In the store, you're going to buy something that they have a higher margin on. So he's going to call them high street peers, okay. Amazon's high street peers could price their products at net income break even and still not undercut Amazon's prices or profitability. For these high street competitors, the game is over. He's writing this in 2008 when everybody's panicking. Nick is thinking very rationally and seeing things unbelievably clearly. They will leak revenues to more efficient rivals as customers respond to the incentives of consistently low prices and convenience. Scale economics works well in bad economic times as well as good. On the busiest day in the run-up to Christmas this year in 2008, order volumes at Amazon were 16% higher than the previous year, compared to the overall retail industry, which are down 10%. In the last few months, Amazon has been priced in the market as if it would not grow in the future, despite some of the best growth prospects we can imagine. That is a very rare combination. And there's a hilarious illustration of this point that Nick's right. Scale economics works well in bad economic times as well as good. This happened in 2008. There was a recession in the early 1990s, Sam Walton was asked about the recession that was happening and he said, I've thought about it and I've decided not to participate. When you have order volumes at Amazon growing 16% year over year in one of the worst financial crisis that the, you know, half a century or whatever the timeframe was. That's Jeff Bezos saying, yeah, I thought about it, I'm not going to participate. And so it's exactly when everybody's panicking when he's investing in Amazon. He says, in our opinion, just a few things in life are noble. And it is because just a few things are noble that no bad has just a few investments. The church of diversification is seen as an insurance against any one idea being wrong. We would propose that if knowledge is a source of value add and few things can be known for sure, then it logically follows that owning more stocks does not lower risk, but raises it. Sam Walton did not make his money through diversifying his holdings, nor did Bill Gates, Andrew Carnegie, or John D. Rockefeller. Great businesses are not built that way. Indeed, the portfolios of these men were more or less 100% in one company, and they did not consider it risky. Go back to that quote, the best investors of all time are not investors at all. They're entrepreneurs who never sold. And so he's asking the question, why is it that no one but the founding Walton family owned Walmart all the way through? Zach and I were told a story which we enjoyed enormously and might help illustrate this point. In the early 1970s, a large successful fund management company analyzed its portfolio and discovered that their sale of IBM 30 years earlier had been a huge error of omission. If they had instead kept their IBM shares for the last 30 years, that stake alone would have been larger than the total funds under management. They all agreed to learn from that particular mistake and as so often happens went back to their desks and got on with life before as if nothing had happened. Around the same time that they realized their mistake, they also made the decision to sell their stake in Walmart, which 30 years later would be worth more than their then-to funds under Management. In terms of dollars of opportunity loss, it is likely to be the biggest single error that firm will make. And so then he makes the point a few pages later, like you cannot just focus on the outputs. If you do, you're going to sell. You have to really understand the central engine of success. You have to understand that business deeply. This is why he says so few things can actually be known. And if you can only know a few things well, then of course you need to be heavily concentrated, bet heavily. It could be a... ([Time 0:40:06](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6c779ba7-a419-4070-890a-537ebcfd3c9c))
    - **Note:** Sometimes the obvious answer is right in front of you and concentrate don’t diversify. Don’t diversify. The best investors are entrepreneurs who never sold. You can’t know many things well so you need to concentrate there is no edge in diversification. It’s all effort and opportunity cost. The only way to truly win is to be willing to be mosunderstood. Cultures that care about the little things are hard to create and impossible to create if not put in place at the firms genesis.
