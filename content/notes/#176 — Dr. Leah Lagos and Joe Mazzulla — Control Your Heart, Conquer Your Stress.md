### Highlights

- Episode AI notes
  1. By practicing resonant frequency breathing at a specific rate, we can control the baroreflex in our autonomic nervous system, allowing us to regulate functions like heart rate and blood pressure.
  2. Resonant frequency breathing at a rate of five to 6.5 breaths per minute stimulates the baroreflex and strengthens it, improving overall control over the body.
  3. The power of three breaths and connecting with others can positively impact one's heart oscillation and help in decision-making based on internal state.
  4. Being attuned to one's internal state is crucial in making decisions to engage or disengage, and physiological state greatly influences decision-making and perception.
  5. A highly sympathetic state can lead to myopic thinking and limited blood flow, emphasizing the importance of managing stress levels. ([TimeÂ 0:00:00](https://share.snipd.com/episode-takeaways/497ad93f-ee27-426c-a9e0-b9c33d12659e))

    - **Note:** Resonant frequency breathing is a vital loop to control your body and bring you back to center control your hrv stabilize yourself. It can also make us more attuned internally which will make us more engaged and present in our every day life.
- The Baroreflex: Controlling Heart Rate and Blood Pressure Through Breathing Technique
  Key takeaways:
  - The process of controlling the baroreflex allows us to regulate certain bodily functions like heart rate and blood pressure.
  - Resonant frequency breathing at a rate of five to 6.5 breaths per minute stimulates the baroreflex.
  - Training the baroreflex through breathing exercises can help strengthen the reflex and improve control over the body.
  - Everyone has a slightly different rate of resonant frequency breathing, typically between five and 6.5 breaths per minute.

  You mentioned sort of turn it on and turn it off. What is it that we control that allows us to do that like a light switch almost? This process takes 10 weeks and I've done this for 17 years, Shane. I've sliced and diced it. I've had people call me from India. Can I please come, Doc? I'll train with you for seven hours a day for 10 days and then go back. Say it doesn't work like that. It's the chronic activation of what's called the baroreflex. The baroreflex is a reflex in your autonomic nervous system that controls heart rate and blood pressure. We identify a rate of breathing that strengthens this reflex. So think about it as an athlete. You train every part of your body that has a muscle, but most people aren't training their heart. We do calf raises. We do arm raises. Why? Because with a certain amount of frequency, we strengthen that muscle and we have control over that body part that's increased. And you're able to do that, so to speak, with the baroreflex. As you stimulate the baroreflex with resonant frequency breathing, a rate that we identify in my office, that everyone has a different rate. It's generally between five and 6.5 breaths per minute, but everyone is slightly different and we're able to maximize each RV on each breath.

    - **Note:** 15 minutes twice a day of breath training can raise hrv. This can help create an automated response to stress. Barrer reflex. Hrv is a strong mark of recovery and doing things we enjoy or that give us life can help our hrv and make us feel better about ourselves. Allow yourself to get out of sympathetic state into parasympathetic control your emotions and breathing so you can calm yourself down and gain control in the critical moment. It can lead to different emotional connections where you are breathing in and cultivating deep love you have for something or someone and then let go this can help strengthen your emotional response and resolve. Connection to your emotions and love.
- The Power of Three and Other Ways to Master Momentum in Decision Making
  Key takeaways:
  - The power of three breaths can help in focusing on a desired state and letting go of the rest of the world
  - Connecting with another person can also positively impact one's heart oscillation
  - Being attuned to one's internal state is crucial in making decisions to engage or disengage
  - Physiological state plays a significant role in decision making and perception of context
  - A highly sympathetic state can lead to myopic thinking and limited blood flow

  And sometimes it's breathing. Joe talks about the power of three he would take. Four and six out, focusing on a desired state on the inhale and letting go of the rest of the world. But there can be others too. And sometimes it's connecting with another person. It could be a spouse. If you're a coach, it could be a player that you're really close to. Things, there are other ways to move your heart oscillation in the moment as well. So that ability to master momentum and being really attuned to that internal state to make the decision on whether to engage or disengage, I think is really important. And it's interesting how much our physiology controls decisions. We think of decision making as such a mental process. But your physiological state prior to making that decision and even during making that decision will impact several different pieces. One, it will impact the kind of context you see. If you are in a highly sympathetic state, you're much more likely to be myopic. You're in a survival state. And by virtue of survival, it's like one track. And the body intensely restricts blood flow. And there are physiological reasons. ([TimeÂ 0:45:14](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2c02ed04-b333-4cd2-9f98-ff4f66c058fe))
    - **Note:** Our physiology restricts our mental state. Stress cuts off blood flow to your brain and these tips help you open those pathways back up. Centering yourself in the moment. Using rituals to center yourself. Transitions are a part of life. Gain control over your mind by controlling your heart. Heal mental strength and control the story we tell ourselves. Strengthen our mental state through control our heart and understanding stressors.
