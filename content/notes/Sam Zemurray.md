### Highlights

- A Russian immigrant who came from nothing to importing bananas to the us and built an empire. The book starts when he’s 33 and trying to stage a coup in hounduras to save and establish his business against the wishes of the American government. He was driven ruthless and relentless. He came to America at 14 and the immigrants of the day couldn’t afford to be children. They always needed to be hustling and working angles. He didn’t trust the reports he would see from the front and get hands on experience with his men he was also relentless mind and pushed hard constantly for success. He knew his business a-z. He tried many jobs then hatched a plan around a market opportunity he saw around bananas. Some bananas called ripes were discarded because by the time they reached the market a week later they would go bad. This was his opportunity ti go fast when his competitors moved flow and he ran with it spending all his money $150 on the bet. He was a farmers son and knew how precious food could be he transported the food from the market in Birmingham ti his town in Selma Alabama. Hustlers motivation while many are failing he’s confident he’ll be successful and get out before he gets got. He ended up traveling in the crate with his first shipment because he spent all his money on bananas. Use your ears more than your mouth he heard from a box car driver if you wired ahead to shop owners they’d meet you on the platform. He offered a telegraph operator a% of the profits for his services and in the end made $40 his first run when he previously was only making $1 a week. He found the opportunity in ripes and grew fast but he needed to be fast because his product was so close to expiration. He met the United fruit founders and went from selling 20k bananas to over a million in a decade. He would go on to run United fruit this all started when he was a kid.

    - **Note:** Sam saw from the front and thought he could be fast where others had been slow. He did this by betting all he had as a kid to sell ripes and made more than he had ever made. Importance of equity in ownership and creating valor where that mere had been none previously.
      He used incentive alignment and listening to establish an empire and overthrew a government
- If you’re on a man’s side you stay on that side or you’re no better than an animal. Zemurray was basically a millionaire in todays standards by the time he was 21 selling bananas he didn’t grow or transport but he was aggressive and wanted to expand. The interplay between him and United fruit is intertwined through the decades. The United fruit founders were much like zemurray the brought bananas to America and were in many ways the Rockefeller of bananas buying out or up all competition by choice or in a downturn with forced selling. Zemurray was a limit crasher always pushing the frontier and going the extra mile. He learned from all the old heads who had made millions and lost it. He crossed Honduras on muleback to scout where to grow his bananas. There are certain times when cards become available that will never be available again a great business man is dumb enough to act on that even when he cannot afford to. He was playing with borrowed money and because he grew up as a farmer he knew which lands were fertile when he traveled across the country on mule. Then he bribed the government to keep things cheap.

    - **Note:** Sam zemurray was very high agency. Always working hard and seeing from the front. He crossed Honduras on muleback to scout for the best banana fields which he understood from his childhood as a farmer. He just did what he wanted and had no regard for anything else. He had no rules or limits he was a robber baron
      There are times when certain properties become available and you need to be stupid enough to take advantage
      You need to back your men or you’re no better than a dog. See from the front rules don't exist crazy agency
- He understood every part of the business and worked on the plantations with the men believing the hard labor releases the soul. He risked yellow fever and terrible conditions he was a hustler. Honduras got bailed out by the us and the terms would’ve killed Sam’s business by making it uneconomic he plowed all his money into this and was willing to lose it all. The Secretary of State says he needs to not meddle in foreign affairs he instead says fuck you and organizes a coup to install a more favorable government holy fuck. He was a legit madman. He would never write things down he kept it all in his head. By the time he was 40 he worked in every role his secret to success. The United fruit people had a ton of respect for zemurray as they were cut from the same cloth but couldn’t own his company for anti trust reasons. He didn’t attend a banquet in his honor because he was busy working in shipments at the dock.

    - **Note:** This dude is about as high agency inner scorecard as it gets. Doesn’t go to a banquet in his honor and overthrows the government because his company needed it to happen. He knew every job in the trade because he worked them all he stuck by his men risking harm to see from the front.
- Zemurray was a founder forever on the attack constantly attacking. United fruit was run by executives and zemurray was a founder. There was a banana war over 5000 acres. United fruit tried to acquire the land which was disputed with lawyers while zemurray just paid both the claims for their land saving money in the process vs the lawyers. Success limited zemurray options and have him something to lose. He sold his company and retired but the company was struggling and zemurray always had agency and when he saw this company failing he acted he went not to the boardroom but to the docks to see the issue. He would sit in the boardroom and hear people debate things and he said this guy is the manager of the area either listen to him and trust him or fire him. The board never listened to zemurray so he went around in secret get proxy shares from shareholders and used this to gain a majority and fire the board reinstalling himself. His second coup he was relentless. When he took over he lays off 25% of people because he goes to the plantations and sees who’s good and who’s not up to task in 60 days he turned the company around in a time of crisis the mere evidence of activity can be enough to get things moving. This first 60 days saved the company there were restrictions placed on bananas during the war so Sam just grew different more valuable crops. When his son died in WW2 in completely changed his life he was never the same. Aligned his interests with the interest of the people in government not the needs of the country but the people. Edwin bernaise methods were selling through indirection he wanted women to smoke and sold cigarettes not as healthy but as empowering. His defining characterist was the belief in his own agency and unwillingness to despair. With cleverness and hustle anything can be conquered

    - **Note:** Sam had belief in his agency saw from the front and was default aggressive. Trust your men completely or fire them. He’s constantly faced with life or death situations and uses his high agency for overthrow government or stage a coup. He figured what needed to be done then charted the path believing totally in himself. Death of loved one.
