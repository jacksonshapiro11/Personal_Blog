### Highlights

- Test with Purpose: Act Only on What Matters
  Summary:
  In medical practice, tests should only be ordered if their results will influence treatment decisions.
  The rationale for ordering a CT angiogram hinges on understanding how both abnormal and normal results will affect patient management. For younger patients, like a 35-year-old with high cardiovascular risk but typically normal CT results, ordering a CT angiogram may not yield actionable insights, similar to a smoker with a normal lung scan whom we still advise to quit smoking.
  Conversely, older patients with high risk factors but strong familial longevity may benefit from a CT angiogram to evaluate underlying health, as they may not need aggressive treatment despite poor biomarker scores.
  The most effective use of CT angiograms occurs with positive findings in younger individuals or negative findings in older patients, as these scenarios can prompt significant changes in management.
  Tracking key biomarkers remains crucial outside these specific cases, ensuring that medical decisions align with the most relevant health risk indicators.

  Speaker 1
  Yeah, I mean, I think there's different ways to think about this. I think there's a principle in medicine that most doctors try to adhere to, which is don't order a test unless there's a chance the test will change your management. And it's easy to deviate from that. I certainly know I do at times. But as a general rule, I try to ask myself the question, before I order this test, how will the outcome change what I do with this patient? So through that lens, you could make a case that the only time you should be ordering a CT angiogram is if you go through the following experiment, which is if it comes back normal, how Will it change what I do? If it comes back abnormal, how will it change what I do? So if you were sitting in my office and I said, well, look, Rhonda, you're 35 years old, your APOB is really high, your family history is such that people get cardiovascular disease in Your family, meaning it's not like you've got a bunch of relatives who are in their 90s who have never had a cardiac event. So you don't have some genetic protection of cardiovascular disease. Do I need a CT angiogram in you to convince me to do anything? Because the truth of it is at 35, your CT angiogram is going to be normal. I mean, it might not be. Mine wasn't at 35, but it probably will be for most people. And if it's normal, will I then say we don't need to do anything about this? No, because that's sort of like saying you're a smoker who has a normal CT scan. You don't yet have lung cancer. Therefore, we should let you keep smoking. No, we should stop you from smoking. So in other words, I just wouldn't have a huge appetite for doing that test in you. There are other patients at the other end of the spectrum where, you know, they come to me, they're 75 years old, their APOB is through their roof. But I noticed like all their relatives live to be 100 and they never had heart disease. And I look at them and I think, do I really want to put this person on lipid lowering medicine at the age of 75?
  Speaker 3
  Why don't we do a CTA?
  Speaker 1
  If the CTA is normal, which by some miracle it could be, I don't think we need to do something. There's clearly something this person has going on that is beyond our understanding of the science so far. So in that sense, I wouldn't do anything about it. The way I think about it is there's a two by two, which is age versus finding, positive or negative. I think CT angiograms are mostly helpful when they have a positive finding in a young person or a negative finding in an old person. That's where it can really cause you to act differently. Outside of those findings, i.e. Positive findings in old people are to be expected, negative findings in young people are to be expected.
  Speaker 2
  I think you should just track the biomarkers of interest and go off that risk. Okay. I mean, like, is a 45 year old considered? I would still put that in a young category. Okay. You still think that CT angiogram would still kind of look maybe good.
  Speaker 1
  It should. And again, I would only think about it through the lens of if the patient is hesitant. So we had a new patient that started a couple of weeks ago. He'd never had one of these tests before, but he had a lot of risk factors. Elevated APOB, elevated LP little A, two big risk factors. But insanely healthy individual, very, very healthy individual. So on the surface, like nobody thought anything of this person. We decided we were going to treat him regardless, and he was completely on board with that. But the question was how aggressively would we treat? And we said, let's let the CTA decide that. If the CTA comes back clean as a whistle, we're going to treat you to like an APOB of 60, which is still aggressive by most people's standards. By our standards, it's sort of middle of the road aggression. If the CTA comes back and there's a problem, meaning you have calcification and soft plaque, we're going to treat you to 30 or 40. So there the CTA helped us make a difference, a real treatment difference. And this is a person who's middle age, so not too old, not too young.
  Speaker 2
  That makes a lot of sense. Before we kind of shift gears on the test, some other things I want to ask you about, have you looked like, I know you've mentioned, it's been a many years since I've heard you talk about Burbling. Every once in a while, I'll get a question and I decide, I want to dive into literature and see if there's anything new.

- Small Changes in Glucose Can Have Big Consequences
  Summary:
  A fasting blood glucose level of 100 mg/dL indicates a critical threshold for health, with only a slight difference in glucose levels (a teaspoon) separating health from type 2 diabetes.
  The liver plays a key role in regulating glucose levels between meals, while muscles act as a sink for glucose during and after eating. Insulin is vital for glucose disposal; it facilitates glucose entry into muscle cells, but exercise can enhance glucose uptake independently of insulin.
  Chronic elevated glucose levels lead to detrimental effects, particularly in microvascular health, affecting organs like the eyes and kidneys.
  Insulin resistance can occur as insulin levels rise in response to chronic high glucose, with both high glucose and insulin linked to serious health outcomes.
  Lifestyle factors like exercise, sleep, and energy balance critically influence insulin sensitivity, with exercise emerging as a powerful tool for improving glucose metabolism. Finally, maintaining lower average blood glucose levels, even slightly below the diabetic threshold, correlates with better long-term health outcomes, making glucose control pivotal in mitigating chronic diseases.

  Speaker 1
  So most people who have had a blood test would recognize that a fasting blood glucose of 100 milligrams per deciliter is sort of right on the cusp of being just, just starting to get to Be too high. So what does that mean? Right? What is a hundred milligrams per deciliter? Well, it means that in, you know, someone my size, in all of my plasma floating around all of my body, all of my blood, I have five grams of glucose. So do I have more than five grams of glucose in my body? Of course I do. I have way more than that. But the majority of the glucose in my body is either in my liver or in my muscles. There's only five paltry grams, 20 calories worth of glucose in my entire circulation at this moment in time. Now, if you assume for a moment that I'm just sitting here at rest and nothing in my body is demanding glucose, meaning my muscles aren't requiring it, the only organ that should be really Demanding it at the moment is my brain. Now of course my red blood cells demand it because they don't have mitochondria, so they're going to have to use glucose. Of course the kidney uses it and all sorts of other things. But basically the majority of the glucose in my bloodstream at this moment in time is being, is there for the purpose of my brain. And you know, you can do the math on this, anybody can do the math on this. Within a number of minutes, I will go through that five grams. So where does the next drop of glucose come from? Comes from my liver. My liver is constantly titrating just a little bit of glucose into my circulation to make sure that number never goes from say a hundred where it is now down to 50 because that would be Way too low. But it's never putting so much in that that number would be 150 or 200. At that point I would be full fledged type two diabetes. So the difference between you and me if I have type two diabetes is literally a teaspoon of glucose in our circulation at any point in time. Think about how tiny a difference that is. And that speaks to this enormous capacitor and buffer system of our liver and our muscles. So if the liver is the thing that is responsible for the doling out of glucose into circulation, the muscle is primarily responsible for where we put glucose when it gets flooded into Our system. And that happens every time you eat. So you eat and again, let's just do some easy math on this. Like you eat a bowl of pasta, like not a Peter Bowl, which is like the size of my head, but just a normal size bowl. You're easily getting 60 grams of glucose. So you eat 60, 70, 80 grams of glucose. Well remember what I just said a moment ago, like if your blood level goes from five to 10 grams, you're hosed. That's a really big problem. Now acutely it's not the end of the world, right? But a healthy person would probably never go from five to eight, more than eight grams. So how do you get that other 60 grams of glucose away? You have to put that into the muscles. And so the muscle is the sink for glucose disposal. And there are two ways that that happens, but the majority of it is an insulin dependent way. So insulin is released by the pancreas when glucose levels are sent to the pancreas sits very high in the GI tract. So very early in the absorption of glucose as it exits the stomach into the duodenum, does the endocrine system vis-a-vis the beta cells sense this increase in glucose? The beta cells release insulin. The insulin results in a signal that goes to the muscle. So the insulin hits an insulin receptor. The insulin receptor triggers a kinase in a cell and that brings a glucose transporter to the surface of a muscle cell so that passively, without a gradient, glucose can flow from outside The cell to inside the cell. So that's called insulin dependent glucose disposal. In a person who's particularly fit, there's also an insulin independent system where just the contractile aspect of the muscle itself is enough to get glucose transporters up to the Surface of the muscle. So people who do a lot of cardio training have this capacity to, and I've seen this in patients with type 1 diabetes who do a lot of training because that's a pure experiment where you have No insulin, you can actually see them lower their glucose without insulin just by exercising. So the act of exercising itself can produce glucose transport across the muscle without insulin. So how does all this figure into health? Well, as we alluded to, glucose is toxic when you have too much of it. Now I'm not going to talk about acute toxicity. So if you ever walked around with like 40 teaspoons of glucose in your bloodstream, you would go into a coma. So there's an acute toxicity, but luckily that's very, very rare and only really would occur in somebody with ketoacidosis. But the chronic toxicity of elevated levels of glucose is significant. And that's where the difference between having four, five, six, seven, eight grams of glucose as the benchmark concentration is a difference in 10 years of life expectancy. And again, like it seems hard to fathom that that makes such a difference, but it does. And it does for several reasons. But one of them is that glucose is involved in the process by which proteins become sticky. And so as the proteins in our blood get glycosylated and get stickier, one, their function is lower, but two, they also tend to obscure the narrowest part of our vascular system. So the tiniest, tiniest, tiniest capillaries become more occluded. And therefore it's harder to deliver oxygen to those tissues. So the canary in the coal mine, believe it or not, of microvascular damage is within the eyes. So a good ophthalmologist is generally the first doctor to tell when a person is on the road to type two diabetes. Because by looking at the retina and by looking at the capillaries in the back of the eye, they're actually able to do something that no one else gets to do in the body, right? Like we don't look directly at the vascular system elsewhere in the body. And they get to do that. They get to shine a light directly onto those capillary beds. So as a general ([Time 1:41:00](https://share.snipd.com/snip/829603f4-a6e9-476a-9f08-4d0cadcb85f6))
    - **Note:** The small things that can effect diabetes and where in the body is shows first. The importance of sleep and exercise in body regulation. Glucose in the body.
