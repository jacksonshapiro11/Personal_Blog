- Summary: Amaryllis Fox, a former CIA agent, shares her experiences in the most elite clandestine operations unit of the CIA in her memoir, "Life Undercover." Fox conducted operations abroad without diplomatic protections and focused on counter-terrorism, infiltrating terrorist networks in the Middle East and Asia. She emphasizes the importance of listening with intent and humanizing the enemy to extract information. Fox believes that understanding someone's fears, dreams, hopes, and aspirations allows for a deeper understanding of geopolitics. She also discusses the power of relationships, following one's instincts, and recognizing each other's humanity.

### Highlights

- Although Fox was trained how to use a Glock, how to get out of flexi-cuffs while locked in the trunk of a car, and how to withstand torture, the bulk of her work was focused on the most simple skill of all: Listening with intent.
  Her work required her to meet with dangerous arms dealers and people who wanted to see Americans dead, but she had to put all of that aside for a period of time. She learned that in order to extract information from her counterpart, she first had to humanize him — not as an arms dealer, but as a fellow parent, for example.
  "The only real way to disarm your enemy is to listen to them," she [says](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/amaryllis-fox-undercover-cia-video_n_57600d31e4b0e4fe5143afc6). "If you hear them out, if you're brave enough to really listen to their story, you can see that more often than not you might've made some of the same choices if you'd lived their life instead of yours.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqhf5x0vf3fkvb4yg0jkyggr))
    - **Note:** Path dependence and listening to others. WE need to recognize others humanity someone may be a terrorist but find common ground maybe they're a father. Take off the mask you project to the world and be you. Words mean different things manifesting something and praying for something are the same thing but one is a conservative idea the other a hippie one. Having dignity and respect for others loosens the knot of conflict in-between you two and good and evil all depend on perspective and are subjective. Humanize strangers
