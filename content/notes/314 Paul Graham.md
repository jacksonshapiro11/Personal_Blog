  Number two, you have to have a deep interest in it. And number three, it offers the scope to do great work. In practice, you don't have to worry much about the third criteria. All you need to do is find something you have an aptitude for and a great interest in. And right away, we get to one of Paul's first footnotes. He says doing great work means doing something important so well that you expand people's ideas of what's possible. But there's no threshold for importance. That's something he's going to repeat many times in different ways throughout the essays. Just keep that in mind. There's no threshold for importance. It's a matter of degree and it's often hard to judge at the time anyway. So I'd rather people focus on developing their interests rather than worrying about whether they're important or not. Just try to do something amazing and leave it to the future generations to say if you succeeded. Back to the top of the essay, he left off. He says, all you need to do is find something you have an aptitude for and a great interest in. That sounds straightforward, but it is often quite difficult. When you're young, you don't know what you're good at. And some kinds of work that you end up doing may not even exist yet. It's funny because that's the same advice I went and I went and talked to the career day at my daughter's school when she was in fourth grade. And I don't think the teachers liked it very much because I started the conversation with, don't worry about what your parents or your teachers think. Just find out what you're naturally interested in and become a learning machine. And so in my own way, I told a bunch of nine year olds that because I was like, listen, when I was your age, there was no such thing as podcasting. It didn't even exist. Back to what Paul said, the way to figure out what to work on is by working. If you're not sure what to work on, guess, but pick something and get going. You'll probably guess wrong some of the time, but that is fine. And this is an idea that you and I have talked about multiple times. You see it in these biographies over and over again, the act of finding your life's work for an entrepreneur usually requires that you're going to have to start more than one business. I'd have to go back to the episodes to see if I could even find somebody that got it right the first time. Maybe I think the closest example of this might be Mark Zuckerberg. Back to this. It's good to know about multiple things. Some of the biggest discoveries come from noticing connections between different fields. Develop a habit of working on your own projects. Do not let work means something that other people tell you to do. And that is such an important sentence. Don't let work means something other people tell you to do. That is the lived experience of most people alive and dead. In fact, Paul has another essay called How to Do What You Love, where he says only a few hundred thousand and his guests, a few hundred thousand people ever actually figure this out. Let me read. I'm going to just read an excerpt from that other essay real quick. He says with such powerful forces leading us astray, it's not surprising that we find it so hard to discover what we like to work on. Most people are doomed in childhood by accepting the axiom that work equals pain. Those who escape this are nearly all lured onto the rocks by prestige or money. How many even discover something they love to work on? A few hundred thousand perhaps out of billions. And so I think that sentence hits even harder after you read the excerpt from his past essay. Don't let work means something other people tell you to do. If you do manage to do great work one day, it'll probably be on a project of your own. What should your projects be? Whatever seems to you excitingly ambitious as you grow older and your taste in projects evolves, exciting and important will converge.

    - **Note:** Find or guess at what you’re interested in and good at and get working. It doesn’t really have to exist just be a learning machine. Don’t let work mean something someone tells you to do. Have your own agency. Only a few out of billions get to do great work. What are you obsessively interested in that would be boring to most people. Learn what you’re excessively interested in the get to the frontier of knowledge and notice the gaps then boldly chase outlier ideas. Choose and Study a field notice then explore promising gaps. Work that feels like play. You need years to understand work in a field and you can jump from field to field and never find anything. A lot of great work is a crazy series of lucky events.
- The Importance of Curiosity and Luck in Finding the Right Work
  Summary:
  Being curious and lucky plays a significant role in finding the right work.
  Mark Twain's journey exemplifies this, starting with a fortunate break that led to a successful book and changed his life. Paul Graham emphasizes the importance of taking action and being open to chance encounters or unexpected sources that guide one to the right path.
  Curious individuals cast a wide net, increasing the likelihood of discovering the ideal endeavor.
  Optimizing for interestingness helps in navigating career choices, as fields should become more fascinating with learning.
  Having unique and diverse interests can be advantageous, leading to strong and productive work outcomes while exploring uncharted territories.

  That scoop leads him to his lecture career, which further enhances his public profile, which then leads him to this 23-week trip in Europe, which in turn is going to lead to the source Material for his first great book, the first publishing success that he ever has, which then in turn changes his life forever. That example from Mark Twain is a microcosm of exactly what Paul Graham is talking about here. What she should do if you're young and ambitious, but don't know what to work on. Mark Twain was young and ambitious. He had no idea what to work on. He put pen to paper. He took action as another way to think about that, right? When you read biographies of people who've done great work, it's remarkable how much luck is involved. They discover what to work on as a result of a chance meeting or by reading a book that they happen to pick up. At the end of that paragraph, Paul has a fantastic footnote. There are many reasons curious people are more likely to do great work, but one of the most subtle is that by casting a wide net, they're more likely to find the right thing to work on in The first place. Okay, so back up top, when in doubt, optimize for interestingness. Fields change as you learn more about them. A field should become increasingly interesting as you learn more about it. If it doesn't, it's probably not for you. Do not worry if you're interested in different things than other people. The stranger your tastes are, in interestingness, the better. Strange tastes often are strong ones, and a strong taste for work means you'll be productive, and you'll be more likely to find new things if you're looking where few others have looked Before.

    - **Note:** Cast a wide net and the job should get more not less interesting over time. Make what you’re excited about. If you don’t love or use your product you’re fucked. If you’re interested you’re not astray you’re good there is no clear path. Most of it is just figuring it out on the way. Working too hard yields diminishing returns. Intense concentration for hours. It will be harder and less important than you think but play that up. Make sure you’re working on what you most want to work on. Unreasonable amount of time working on a problem. Excessive commitment. Do small work every day. We underrate exponential growth in the beginning and getting started is the hardest. Exponential growth is powerful. Let your mind wander to progress. Cultivate and try to be the best. Don’t aim to be good. You need to be genuine and earnest in your convictions. Don’t seem or signal work just get it done.
- The Importance of Earnestness in Doing Great Work
  Summary:
  Earnestness is crucial in doing great work as it involves showing sincere and intense conviction, being intellectually honest to seek more truth, focusing on what matters rather than formality or affectation.
  Nerds have an advantage in great work due to their innocent boldness and lack of effort in seeming a certain way. The path to great work is challenging and requires putting ideas forward rather than just criticizing.
  Paying no heed to critics is essential, as the harshest criticisms often come from those who contribute the least.

  And so it's like a negative role. You could say, hey, avoid being fake, whatever the case is. But he's like, well, how do you actually express this idea positively? How would you say what to be instead of what not to be? And he says the best answer is earnest. And so we're going to define earnest resulting from our showing sincere and intense conviction. I love that definition. Intense conviction. The core of being earnest is being intellectually honest. You're trying to see more truth than others have seen so far. Key to doing great work. And how can you have a sharp eye for truth if you're intellectually dishonest? Another subtle component of earnestness is informality. It means focusing on what matters instead of what doesn't. What formality and affectation have in common is that as well as doing the work, you're trying to seem a certain way as you're doing it. That's one reason nerds have an advantage in doing great work. They expend little effort on seeming anything. Nerds have a kind of innocent boldness. This is hilarious. Nerds have a kind of innocent boldness. That's exactly what you need in doing great work. It is not learned. Be the one who puts things out there rather than the one who sits back and offers sophisticated sounding criticisms of them. It's easy to criticize. It's true in the most literal sense and the route to great work is never easy. And another thing like who cares what the critics say. The loudest booze always come from the cheapest seats. ([Time 0:31:42](https://share.snipd.com/snip/dd26d253-4a8d-4095-97d2-ff2b1e949e2d))
    - **Note:** The loudest boos come from the cheapest seats don’t listen to critics. Focus be earnest and redo things. Great look is a mix of creation and discovery. Don’t be passive be active. Be very curious about a few things and semi curious about many things. Investigate where your model breaks. Change breaks the brittle you must break the rules. Ideas being the models. A good new idea must seem bad to a lot of people or it would’ve been done already. Ignorance of rules can lead to independent minded studying unfashionable problems. Life is short so you need to not care and do what you like. Try a lot of small things you can do a lot of things without first trying and failing at many more. Be default aggressive and start instead of delaying and start small. Great things evolve over time and it becomes more clever and ambitious over time. Spend time lavishly but don’t waste time use it intentionally to explore a lot. The young people think everything is important while the older understand the few important parts. School tells us everything is important we must distill that down based on our skills and abilities to the few points of max leverage.
- The Problem with Schools and the Importance of Doing Good Work
  Summary:
  Schools confuse by focusing on everything equally instead of the important things, filling minds with nonsense and inducing passivity.
  They mislead about work by presenting problems with predetermined solutions and teaching to win by hacking tests. Schools cultivate dependency on shortcuts, while the key is to do good work and focus on skills rather than influential connections.
  True excellence comes from originality and mastering a field through imitation to understand its workings.

  And a source of this confusion about, okay, well, like they're worried about everything equally when it's like just focus on the really important things and ignore everything else. So the source of the confusion goes back to this is the problem with with school. It just fills your head with a bunch of nonsense. So everybody almost by default will arrive at adulthood with a head full of nonsense. And he says much of that nonsense left in your head is left there by schools schools induce passivity the sooner you overcome this the better schools also give you a misleading impression Of what work is like in school they tell you what the problems are and they're almost always solvable using no more than what you've been taught so far in real life you have to figure out What the problems are and you often don't know if they're solvable at all. But perhaps the worst thing that schools do is they train you to win by hacking the test. You cannot do great work by doing that. So stop looking for that kind of shortcut. Do not skimp on the work itself. Don't think of yourself as dependent on some gatekeeper giving you a big break. Even if this were true, the best way to get it would be to focus on doing good work rather than chasing influential people. It's that idea that you should try to be so good that people can't ignore you. People new to a field will often copy existing work. There's nothing inherently bad about that. There's no better way to learn how something works than trying to reproduce it. Nor does copying necessarily make your work unoriginal. Originality is the presence of new ideas not the absence of old ones. ([Time 0:48:56](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0985923a-a65c-4285-ab1a-fe9744330ab6))
    - **Note:** Schools teach to test and feed you problems with solutions when in reality the world is much more confusing. Copy stuff from distant fields/ mental models from fields as philosophical points. Spend time with ambitious people seek out the best colleagues. Great work happens in clusters so colleagues are vital. Get away from negativity it’s hard enough to do great work internal negativity will kill you. Inner monologue and your morals compounds and con positively or negatively effect your work a lot. Keep this cycle going and do easier things to get it going. Consider set backs and backtracking part of your process. Get direct audience feedback. Direct relationship seek out people who give you not take energy from you. Don’t be guided by prestige. Curiosity is the best guide the discoveries are there you need to want to want to
