### Highlights

- I’ve come to realize that my “laziness” actually comes from two deeper issues.
  ***Am I Just Not Good Enough?***
  Whenever I’ve tried to sit down and write, I can barely manage a sentence or two before I freeze. It’s easy to blame a lack of skill—and to be fair, skill is part of it—but I think the real reason is that I don’t believe I can write at the level I expect of myself. I’ve been stuck in a loop, where fear of not being good enough keeps me from practicing, and not practicing keeps me from improving.
  Recently, with a bit of encouragement from a friend, I’ve started to break out of that mindset. I know that the only way to get better at writing is to *actually write*. So my plan is simple: write often, read more, and slowly improve until I reach a point where I can be proud of my work.
  ***Do I Care Too Much About What Others Think?***
  This ties into my fear of not being good enough. I’m constantly worried about what others might think of my writing. If *I* don’t think it’s great, how can I expect anyone else to? When I read articles on Hacker News about people doing incredible things and writing brilliantly about them, it’s hard not to feel overwhelmed. It’s that classic feeling: there’s so much to do, but because there’s so much, I don’t even know where to start.
  But I’ve realized that this too has to change. I’ll never get anywhere if I’m paralyzed by the fear of what others might think. It’s time to put that aside and focus on my own growth. The only way forward is through action. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01je1jc856e89q70pwpmy6z850))
