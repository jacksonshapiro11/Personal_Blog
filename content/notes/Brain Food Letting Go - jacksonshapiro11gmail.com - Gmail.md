### Highlights

- “You deserve to be loved and chosen — not almost loved, or almost chosen. ... Have the courage to let go of the people who leave your heart confused. Let go of the people who make you feel like you are compromising all that you desire, and all that you hope for, and all of the goodness and the beauty that you know exists in this world, for a skinny version of love. ... Let go of the fears you have that keep you holding on to something that hurts, something that is so heavy, something that has only left you feeling misunderstood, or unworthy, or at war with yourself. Let go of waiting for the people you have always treated kindly, to treat you kindly. Let go of waiting for the people you have always treated with respect, to treat you with respect. Let go of waiting for the people you have always chosen, to finally choose you. Let go of waiting. Let go of holding your breath, just hoping that things change.” — Bianca Sparacino, A Gentle Reminder
- “Being happy with what you have doesn't prevent you from pursuing what you want.” ** “The difference between average results and exceptional if often found in what you don't do. Everyone can say yes to great opportunities but only a focused person will say no to average ones. You can do anything, but you can’t do everything.” *** “Keep the goal. Change your mind about how to reach it. One sign you're getting in your own way, is not changing your tactics when you're not getting the result you want.”
