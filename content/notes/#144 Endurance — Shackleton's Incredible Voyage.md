  Speaker 1
  Think this will give you a better understanding of why it's so important to understand Shackleton's story and why so many other historical figures have referenced him. This is the basic plot of The Forgotten Highlander. Alistair Urquhar, who's the author and he's telling his story, was constricted into the British military to fight during World War II. He was 19 years old. He was sent to Singapore. The Japanese invaded and he was taken hostage. He survived 750 days in the jungle working as a slave on the death railway and the bridge on the river Kwai. Most of the time he worked completely naked. He contracted dysentery, malaria and tropical ulcers. A lot. He was transferred to a Japanese hellship. The ship was torpedoed. Almost everyone on the ship died. He did not. He spent five days of drift at sea until he was picked up by a Japanese whaling ship. He was then sent to Nagasaki and forced to work in a mine. Two months later he was struck by the blast from the atomic bomb. He was freed by the US Navy shortly thereafter. He returns home to Scotland and finds out his best friend died in the war and the girl he loved got married and moved to Canada. At 90 years old he writes this book to inspire others to persevere when they are faced with hardship in their life. That last line right there. He says 90 years old he wrote the book to inspire others to persevere when they are faced with hardships in their life. I think that's the same way people use Shackleton. I used the Forgotten Highlander. I'm now moving forward. I'm definitely going to reference this book in Shackleton's story. Anytime you're going through struggles and that's inevitable that we all do. It could be a death of a loved one. You could have troubles at work. Whatever it is. I think it's extremely helpful to step outside of yourself. Things are not going well right now but I'm not naked in the jungle and I don't have malaria. I just want to relate the two stories together with this quote from Steve Jobs. Why am I bringing this up? Why is this so important? Because they came across this quote from Steve Jobs a long time ago and I've never forgot about it. He says I'm convinced about half of what separates successful entrepreneurs from non-successful ones is pure perseverance. I don't think that just applies entrepreneurship. I think it applies to doing anything that's really, really hard. What Steve is telling us there is most people quit. They give up half of what made him successful. Half of what he fuses makes other people successful is the fact that they just refuse to. I want to go back to right where I left off in the book. Their ship has been crushed and they're forced to evacuate on these giant flows which are just giant pieces of ice floating in the ocean. This is an insane coincidence when I'm going to read you and then I'm going to give you some background on the trip and more on Shackleton. The nears known place where they might find at least food and shelter was Tiny Paulette Island which is 346 miles away. ([Time 0:04:13](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c87ab40d-225a-4b84-a8fd-e6e4a03b14a1))
    - **Note:** Struggles are inevitable and in these times it becomes much more important to step outside of yourself and transcend yourself. Half of what seperates success and failure is pure perseverance. Shackleton wanted to visit the South Pole not because it was easy but because it was hard. Shackleton was incredibly self reliant believed deeply in his own agency. He was very purposeful in his life. He wanted to achieve a position in the world in which he was rich for life. He rose through the ranks of the navy young but would get dilusioned and would always have new schemes and side projects. He was willing to go into mining whaling jumping around to many ideas. He was unwilling to conform to the demands of everyday life he was a misfit and excitement to unrealistic ventures made him seem very immature and irresponsible but rarely are the greats fitting in the mold. He was a great leader of men. He needed something bold for his ego and his drive. When you’re in a hopeless situation with no way out pray for Shackleton. By endurance we conquer was his family motto.
- Shackleton's Uncertainty and Government Approval for the Expedition
  Key takeaways:
  - Shackleton's uncertainty about whether to stay or embark on the expedition
  - The government's one-word telegram response to Shackleton's inquiry
  - Focus simplifies things and reduces complexity
  - The stowaway and Shackleton's warning about potential cannibalism
  - The rapid deterioration of conditions after leaving South Georgia Island
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Begins right as they're about to leave, Shackleton's uncertain about, you know, I need a, he felt fierce loyalty to his country. Should I stay? So he winds up asking them, but let me read this part to you first. Shackleton's position could hardly have been worse. He was damned if he did and damned if he didn't. He was just about to leave on the expedition he had dreamed about and worked towards for almost four years. This was four years of prep went into it before they were even able to get on the boat. Vast sums of money, much of an involving future commitments had been spent and countless hours had gone into planning and preparation. At the same time, he felt very strongly about doing his part in the war. So he asked, he asked the government, what they think it should do. The reply was a one word telegram. Proceed. Two hours later, we're going to get, Churchill has to pop up in the story. Of course he does. Two hours later, there was a longer wire from Winston Churchill, who was then the first lord of the admiral, admiral, admiralty stating that the government desired the expedition to go on. So after four years of a lot of uncertainty, they finally embark on their journey. And I love this part. And really the summary of this part is that focus simplifies things around you. All the ambiguity of the planning is gone, right? And now they're just, they have one goal and one goal only. If it'd been reduced from a highly complex existence with a thousand petty problems to one of the barest simplicity in which only one real task remained, the achievement of the goal. So Shackleton picked 27 men to go with him. They find out there's a stowaway. There's a 28th person that was not invited. And this is what Shackleton said to him. If we run out of food and anyone has to be eaten, you will be first. Do you understand? So they went up leaving South Georgia Island on December 5th, 1914. Things go bad very rapidly by January 18th. So what is that? A month and two weeks later, the endurance is stuck in the ice. They call it bessette. ([Time 0:18:03](https://share.snipd.com/snip/00df782a-9154-4c5c-9faa-c306794ee8d9))
    - **Note:** His interviews for crew members lasted no more than 5 minutes. Focus simplifies things. When the planning was gone and they took off on the expedition everything became more clear. They were deeply stuck in the ice and it was going to sink and they had to abandon their ship in the arctic but but he needed to remain composed and stoic for his men. They’re on an auxiliary boat for hundreds of days. We’re all influenced by the words and actions of those around us more than we realize he needs to manage all the mental health of all the men. He would personally associate with the most negative as to keep them at from the rest of the men.
- Shackleton and the Drake Passage
  Key takeaways:
  - Negative roommates are deliberately chosen to influence thoughts
  - Temper overconfidence and arrogance
  - The plan is to march towards Paulette Island with two boats
  - They have to drag the boats over ice and snow
  - Diaries reveal the changing state of mind
  - No one likes uncertainty
  - Travel light for ultimate survival
  - Equipment burden is detrimental
  - The journey begins the next day
  - Shackleton's burden is heavy
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So he'll make sure if they're picking roommates for tents, he'll pick the people that are more negative so he can influence their thoughts. And if they are saying negative things, it only influences him. So there's a, there's a, as you can imagine over this long story, there's all these peaks and valleys, peaks and valleys that continue to repeat over and over again. And so during a peak where they're elated, he has this great parable about tempering your overconfidence. You don't want to be overconfident too early. So she says, Shackleton said, there once was a mouse who lived in a tavern. One night the mouse found a leaky barrel of beer and he drank all he could. When the mouse had finished, he sat up, twirled his whiskers and looked around arrogantly. Now then he said, where is that damn cat? So at this point in the story, the boat is finally gone. So they know, okay, this is not temporary. Now they're, this is what they're forced to, this is what happens after they're forced to abandon the endurance. This is the actual plan that they have. The plan as they all knew was to march toward Paulette Island, 346 miles to the northwest. And they would be dragging two of their three boats with them since it was assumed that they would eventually run into open water. So these are like lifeboats. This is what's going to make the story even crazier. They're about 20 to 22 foot long. Now they have to drag them over ice and snow because eventually they're going to say, hey, the only way we're out of this, we're going to have to take these tiny boats through, they don't know this yet. They're eventually going to take it through the Drake Passage, essentially the worst part of the ocean on the planet in a 22 foot boat. That's what Shackleton does. It's insane. There was even a, now this was interesting, what I found very interesting about reading the book is you get insight because a lot of the men are carrying, keeping diaries. And we see how their state of mind is influenced and changes constantly. So it says there was even a trace of mild exhilaration in their attitude. At least they had a clear cut task ahead of them. The nine months of indecision of speculation about what might happen of aimless drifting were now over. So it just speaks to, you know, no one really likes uncertainty. This is what he told the crew and why speaking with the utmost conviction, Shackleton pointed out that no article was of any value when weighted against their ultimate survival, meaning travel light. And he exhorted them to be ruthless in reading themselves of every necessary ounce regardless of its value from, no, this is really, really, really smart. From studying the outcome of past expeditions, he believed that those who that burden themselves with equipment to meet every contingency had fared much worse than those that had sacrificed total preparedness for speed. The journey would begin the next day on the eve of setting out. Shackleton wrote, I pray God, I can manage to get the whole party safe to civilization. So just want to pause for a moment and try to put yourself in his shoes. This is one of the heaviest burdens a human can have. ([Time 0:22:44](https://share.snipd.com/snip/584052a5-106e-4ac3-bc3f-02696cfcc436))
    - **Note:** They set out for and island with supply after being stuck for 9 months the men were excited because people hate uncertainty even though they were leaving security of the boat they were no longer stuck. they’re basically dragging 3 22 feet life boats 180 miles that they’ll neee to later cross the Drake passage. He said travel light he wanted to sacrifice optionslity to raise the mean survival by lower the transport amount. He had the life of everyone in their hands. They had to hunt wildlife and they were drifting on a block of ice originally they were squeamish about killing things with their hands but their will to survive prevailed over their feelings very soon. Shackleton was the boss and continued to push through and lead his men. He never let his understanding of this duty waiver. You can make heaven or hell out of every situation and thought demoralization was a bigger threat than the cold or seas. Understands the deep power of the mind.

  Speaker 1
  So this is an example of that. Shackleton reluctantly announced that they could not go any farther. Most of the men received the news with dismay. To hear Shackleton himself say that they had been beaten sounded almost unnatural and a little frightening. None of them however could possibly have felt their defeat so intensely as Shackleton, to whom the thought of quitting was abhorrent. Go back to that Steve Jobs quote, half of what makes you successful is pure perseverance, meaning you are not going to quit. The Shackleton's version of that, the thought of quitting was abhorrent. He wrote in his diary that night. I turned in but could not sleep. Thought the whole matter over and decided to retreat to more secure ice. It is the only safe thing to do. I am anxious. I do not like retreating but prudence demands this course. And so we see in the story of Shackleton something we have seen over and over again that sometimes your strengths, your greatest strengths can also be your greatest weakness. And we get that insight into how this befell Shackleton as well. Shackleton was not an ordinary individual. He was a man who believed completely in his own invincibility. So that is a huge strength, right? But it could also be a weakness in certain circumstances. It is very hard. It is not black and white. And to whom defeat was a reflection of personal inadequacy. Who might have been an act of reasonable caution to the average person was to Shackleton a detestable admission that failure was a possibility. Alfred Lanzing can write his ass off. There is going to be some sentences in the book. Just the writing in this book is insane. It is one of the best books I have ever read. I could not put it down. I cannot tell you how good it is. So the point where I fell asleep reading it, I could not wait to wake up the next morning and find out what happens to the story. It is fantastic. There is going to be some sections I share with you that I have nothing to add other than this is just a great sentence. And especially the description you really feel when Shackleton finally makes it. I had tears of joy in my eye. I am not hyperbole. You feel like you know who this person is, the way he describes him. And then I really like the fact that there is a lot of quotes from all the men's different diaries in here. You get an insight. You follow them along to several hundred pages in our life. But almost two years in their life of just intense struggle. And you really are towards the end rooting for them to survive. Which they do. Which is insane. Okay. This indomitable self-confidence of Shackleton took the form of optimism. But at the same time the basic egotism that gave rise to his enormous self-reliance, remember that is at the positive traits about to be turned into a negative, occasionally blinded him to realities. He tacitly, I think I already pronounced that word, expected those around him to reflect his own extreme optimism. ([Time 0:30:58](https://share.snipd.com/snip/32cb7d94-23e3-4980-a437-9646e4b8f145))
    - **Note:** Shackleton sometimes had to backtrack but believed deeply in his invinciblility which was his greatest strength and a weakness. He was a formidable individual who expected others to maintain his extreme optimism but this was unrealistic to expect from others. He was constantly attempting and failing and doubt was creeping in and he was wearing down but he could not rest of dispair he had to keep pushing. His mental health started to degrade heavy burden of 27 men living wet and below freezing with no sleep. They’re floating on giant piece of ice making life of death decisions under deep uncertainty. They were on this mile wide piece of ice that had shrunk to 50 yards. The ice opens and closes really quickly so if you don’t launch we’ll you can get taken out by the ice. Shackleton decides they have to go for it knowing failure is certain death and issues to order to proceed. They key to surviving wasn’t the next 12 hours but next step and that step was to row. Focus imtentently on the present moment. Focus on the current moment.
- Desperate Attempt for Survival: Rowing Towards an Unknown Destination
  Key takeaways:
  - The key to surviving is not thinking too far ahead, but focusing on the next step.
  - In desperate situations, the focus should be on the present and the immediate actions needed for survival.
  - The men endured sleep deprivation and physical exhaustion to reach Elephant Island.
  - Arriving at Elephant Island was a significant milestone after 497 days at sea.
  - Shackleton and a small group plan to travel 650 miles to South Georgia Island for help.
  - The journey to South Georgia Island across the stormy ocean is treacherous and requires skilled navigation.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  One of the people that he hires to run his cruise tells Larry a story. I think they're down eight to one. They wind up coming back and winning whatever boat race they're in. And he talks about how he manages his own perspective, this guy that Larry hired. And he says something he learned from his friends that went through Navy SEAL training is the ones that got through the training never thought too far ahead. They're not like, oh, I have to do three more days of this or I have to do 12 more hours. They're like, I have to do one more step. They only focus. The key to surviving is don't think too far ahead, just focus on the next step. Now, that I think is a good lesson that we can learn not only in physical feats like Navy SEAL training or what Shackleton has to endure right now and where we are in the story, but what we're doing. So there's no point in looking too far ahead. I just need to, what's the next step? And let me get to that next step and then I'll do the next step. And then that's it. And I'll just keep doing it. And if I do that over a long period of time, I'll get to where I need to go. So it says they were in the boats and that was all that mattered. They thought neither of patients camp, meaning the past, nor an hour in the future. There was only the present and that meant row, getaway, escape. It's just like, we don't know where we're going. We don't even know where we're at yet because we haven't been able to take a reading because we can't see the sun. But you know what? All we're going to do is I need to row once, then I need to row again. And then when I'm done with that row, I'll row more and keep going and just focus on the next actual movement that I need to do. So once they launched a boat, there's no turning back. They're about to get out of the pack of ice and they're about to go into open sea. They're trying to navigate towards an island so they could at least not be in boats for, they might be in them for several weeks. I can't remember the exact time, but this is a description and this is just insane when you think about what's happening. They made a pitiful sight. Three little boats packed with the odd remnants of what had been once a proud expedition bearing 28 suffering men in one final, almost ludicrous bid for survival. But this time, there was to be no turning back and they all knew it. And this is going to give you a good idea of how desperate things get while they're trying to get there. They're eventually going to land on this thing called Elephant Island, which is there's no, nobody lives on it. It's just literally to get out of the boats and try to get on solid land. I'm going to describe this to you right now. They had no sleep for almost 80 hours and their bodies had been drained by exposure and effort of almost the last vestige of vitality. But the conviction that they had to land by nightfall gave rise to a strength born of desperation, more great writing here, a strength born of desperation. It was pull or perish and ignoring their sickening thirst. They leaned on their oars with what seemed to be the last of their strength. So what did I forgot to I left out a part there? Why they said thirsty? They bought two packs of water. One of them was tainted. So they have to drink the blood of seals to avoid dying of thirst very similar to the story I just told you where they're drinking the blood of the birds so they don't die of thirst. They finally make it on an elephant island. This is the description. This is just a more great writing. They were on land. It was the merest handhold, 100 feet wide and 50 feet deep. A meager grip on a savage coast exposed to the full fury of the sub-antarctic ocean. But no matter, they were on land. For the first time in 497 days, they were on land. Solid, unsinkable, immovable, blessed land. Okay so there's a really helpful map at the beginning of the book that I referenced over and over again. It was reading the book. So right now in this story, all of them are together. They're on elephant island. They are 650 miles away from South Georgia Island, which is where they started this expedition from, which is the only place they know for sure. There's a whaling station there. So they know for sure there's people there that can help them. And so what Shackleton has to make the decision now, he's like, okay, I'm taking one of the boats. It's called the James Canard or James Cared. It's 22 feet long and it's going to be me and five people. We are going to risk our lives to try to go get help because at the whaling station then you have these gigantic ships that you can go back and rescue the other, what is that, 22, 21 other men that are going to be stranded on elephant island. And this is a great description of the difficult tasks that's going to lay ahead of them. They would travel perhaps a thousand miles across the stormiest ocean on the globe. The ultimate goal was an island no more than 25 miles wide at its widest point. Remember, this is 1915. There is no GPS to guide an open boat that distance under conditions that were frightening to even contemplate and then to strike a pinpoint on the chart where tasks that would solely tax even worse, worse is his navigator that he's going to have to take with him, worse the skill as a navigator. So if they go too far south, they miss it. The next land is 3000 miles east. They cannot miss it. So they have to travel. They think it's about a thousand miles. I'm not sure. The ones that are being 650 I think is the course that they actually chart and they have to hit. I mean, think about that, a 25 mile wide island in the middle of the sub-antarctic ocean. So spending a few days on elephant island getting ready for this journey. ([Time 0:40:32](https://share.snipd.com/snip/363709b7-e814-474f-aa6f-93a08ec26276))
    - **Note:** They shipped out after being reduced to very little of a proud expedition to go on their life or death passage back. They initially rowed for 80 hours straight. They had conviction to make land by nightfall it was their only option. Strength born of desperation. They set out after reaching land to cross the Drake passage across 650 miles to reach and island 25 miles wide that was the only land for 3000 miles. This was testing the resolve and skill of the men to their core. Shackleton starts to really doubt himself needing reassurance from his navigator about his decision to split then men and his abilities they encounter 40 foot waves and hurrican force winds. The only thing to do was to hang on an endure. They were posed by an angry determination to see things through no matter what. They were subjected to these conditions for 13 days. They believed they deserved to make it. 522 days to get back. They had to land on the west side and needed to get to the east side but couldn’t because of a hurricane so they need to cross this 30 mile island of mountains and ice that had never been crossed before. It takes 4 attempts to recover is crew but all 27 survive. In 1960 when this booo was written only one other crew had ever crossed south George island and that was with the aid of expert climbers full equipment and helicopters. Shackleton did with 3 people and 36 hours and no sleep because if you fell asleep you’d die in the cold. 3 men with a 50 foot rope and axe vs this group of experts who plotted everything with all gear at their disposal. We are all more capable then we think. There is no way they could’ve done it other than they had to.
