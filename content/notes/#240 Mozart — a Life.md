  He had many misfortunes and many disappointments and a life of constant hard work lived at the highest possible level of creative concentration, but his warm spirit always bubbled. He loved his God, his family, his friends, and above all, his work, which he equated with God's service. And that was all a reasonable man, or an unreasonable one for that matter, could wish for. God bless him. That is an excerpt that comes at the end of the book that I'm going to talk to you about today, which is Mozart A Life and is written by Paul Johnson. This is the third book by Paul Johnson that I've read for the podcast. If you haven't listened to it yet, I'd highly recommend going back to listening to episode number 225, which is on Winston Churchill. Paul writes these really short, no-fluff, crisp biographies. He's done a bunch. He's written, I don't know, like 10 or 20 of them. I'm going to go back and read a ton of them, like the ones with Socrates, Napoleon, Eisenhower. Really, any on his list, that look interesting. I want to go back to this line though, because I think that's a great description, having reached the end of the book, of like a great synopsis of Mozart. And he said, A Life of Constant Hard Work lives at the highest possible level of creative concentration. A Life of Constant Hard Work lived at the highest possible level of creative concentration. That is a great summary of what I learned about Mozart from reading this book. ([Time 0:02:08](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e8d7b907-3b47-427f-8636-34569f4e2d53))
    - **Note:** A life of hard work lived at the greatest level of concentration. He rarely made errors and corrected them fast he was always working day and night on his music this lead to his having one of the most prolific careers of all time despite dying in his mid 30s. His father started him very young. The mind is. Powerful place what you feed it will effect you in a powerful way. Motzart dad was a musician but knowing he couldn’t be very successful there his time into his kids and realized in motzart he had a true genius from a young age. His dad thought his sons gift was from a god and that making him great was a divine quest. Missionary versus mercenaries. Music became motzart second nature he could do both quality and quantity. Beauty and unrelenting industry but also a great personality. At this time musicians were seen as servants. He’s underpaid and mistreated because music wasn’t very valued. Motzart was a transcendent cross disciplinary genius at this time musicians didn’t own the distribution and they had no equity in themselves which made them poor. Age of infinite leverage. He was very experienced at 16 now yiu can get a lot of experience at a young age use your agency. Motzart was living in the time of the enlightened despots and had no agency.

  So I complete top down central like centralized authority. And the no, I left myself on this is like you don't tell Babe Ruth how to hold a bat. Like what is this guy doing? This is to be sure rather on the long side Mozart did not know then of his predilection for brevity, but the hostility with which his grace received it was uncalled for. So he's playing for his grace quote unquote. And he's like, this is too long. Mozart who could turn anything into an advantage advantage rather like the economy of means. So I needed to do a better job of describing what just happened there. Mozart's performing them performing for him. Remember child prodigy? Musical genius. One of the best ever do it. Right. And this guy's like, no, too long. And that's why I said like you don't tell Babe Ruth to hold a bat. But what Mozart did is it's like, all right, well, you know, this is all he knows at this point. He doesn't know it's possible. Like you don't have like this is the environment he was built in or born in rather right. And so he's like, okay, that's fine. Like you have a set of constraints. I love constraints. And so I love that this is like a version of like relentless resourcefulness that we've seen the greatest entrepreneurs right. Mozart turned anything into an advantage. So he's like, okay, I like the economy of means. I will take your demand and I'll use it as a constraint to increase my creativity. And so this guy doesn't even know what he has like in court. He doesn't realize that he's like the he's got this just gifted prodigy more description on this guy. He was domineering and surrounding himself as a board and it's who copied him. He tended to treat musicians as lackeys and any disagreement or argument as criminal insubordination. There's many examples where if you're hired at court, you're you know, you're you're essentially playing for extremely rich people, but they treat you just like they would like a regular servant. And any kind of disagreement you might have like they'll literally just throw you in jail back to Mozart's approach to his work. This reminds me of Sam Zemuri. He said, if you know your business from A to Z, there's no problem you can't solve. So one of my favorite quotes of any book I've ever read. If you remember Sam Zemuri's story, it's the book called The Fish of the Whale. He starts selling pedaling about to rot about to expire bananas, builds this entire vertically integrated banana empire and then overtakes the largest fruit company in the world. It's one of the crazy stories ever. But I think that that what Sam did where he just starts at the very bottom and then studies his entire industry and business and knows everything. Therefore, you can solve any problem that pops up. It's exactly Mozart's approach to to music. ([Time 0:20:40](https://share.snipd.com/snip/38ce3e8a-3006-4e5d-b92e-bd6ebd2a7bb4))
    - **Note:** Motzart turned constraints into strengths being very adaptive to constraint optimization environments. Very mentally flexible. Sam zemurray know your business from a-z and there is no problem you can’t solve. Motzart as well became an expert in his field. Start at the bottom and study every aspect of the business. Motzart would allignment incentives with the people who made his instruments he wanted to get instruments from only the best deep understanding of domain and commitment to excellence. Motzart developed physical attributes his competition didn’t because of his deep dedication to practice more than anyone else in his field. Do today what others don’t do you can do what they can’t. He had a highly personal approach to music and had incredible hand muscles that allowed him to play instruments different. He sought out learning from a players.

  Want to talk to A players because they know what what their instrument can be made to do by a masterful player. More on the historical background when he lived. And I think this can apply to like if you're not sure what to work on, it's just some advice here. We have to remember one important fact about Mozart. He lived at the beginning of the first explosion of world population, which meant among countless other things, a cumulatively vast and rapid increase in the amount of music performed, the number of musicians, the amount of money spent on music, the spread of music printing, and the proliferation of instrument makers and their competitive ingenuity. So think about the internet in our age. It's like the music industry in his age. What came to mind, because I was just rereading it, too, is I've mentioned a couple of times that I really think, especially because it's free online, as we really have no excuse not to do this, that everybody should read Mark Andreessen's blog archive. It's like 200 pages. His venture capital firm gives it away for free. If you just Google Mark Andreessen's blog archive, you can just go to Founders Number 15. I'm pretty sure I link it there. But Mark gives a lot of advice about like, why do I start up? Why not to do start up? How to think about your career and all it's just jam after jam after jam from a genius, right? But he said something that was really interesting, where he's like, I only recommend that you do paraphrasing. This is not a direct quote. But he says like, you should only work in industries where the important companies of that industry, the founders are still in charge at the companies. So let's say you're a super smart and dedicated hardworking person, and living in American 1900s. It's very, very clear what industry you go to Michigan and you work in the automotive industry. And if you've heard a bunch of my episodes, you already know this because I did what like a 13 part 12 or 13 part series on all the mad geniuses, these founders, these fanatical founders that built this, the automotive industry, which is one of the largest industries in the world today. But what you wouldn't do is go work at one of those companies now. I mean, I guess you have Tesla, which is the first successful American new car company that I think since Chrysler. So it was almost, I think Chrysler was in the 1930s. I can't remember the exact date. I don't have it in front of me. But Marx advice is just like, well, you pay it's a way to not only pick the industries to work in, but also to pick the industries to avoid. And he does that through like a very simple proxy, like are the most, we're the most important companies in the industry that you're targeting, and are the founders still in charge of those companies, if not, try to find an area where they are where the founders are still in charge. I think it was Napoleon. I can't remember who said the quote. I'm pretty sure it was Napoleon who said the attention to details of religion and success. Mozart gives a demonstration of that. Mozart made a point of inspecting the drums of any orchestra for which he was composing to make sure its drums were in top form. If necessary, being so quick, he could rescore before performance. He also took into account the weather. On a damp night in a hall with poor heating, upper notes might be impossible. On the other hand, very dry weather might turn them sharp. Musicians themselves knew this, but very few composers did. And it was precisely Mozart's attention to such details that endeared him to his players. Attention to detail is the religion of success. This is a fantastic description of Mozart the person. Mozart never had any difficulty making friends. He had charm. He was touching and quick-tempered, like gunpowder, one friend who knew him well said. But he was also lovable. I shall never forget his little animated countenance when he lighted up with the glowing rays of genius. And what a great sentence here to describe a person. And he says it is impossible to describe it as it would be to paint sunbeams. So we're in his 20s. This is how this is the five ways, I think, the five ways that Mozart made money. Mozart's income came from five main sources. The first was pupils. Mozart claimed he did not like teaching music. On the other hand, many of his pupils became friends. Opera commissions was a second source. ([Time 0:26:38](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f13c58f4-6d61-4e94-82c3-82614332aaba))
    - **Note:** In his time Mozart was in the fastest growing industry in your time you should attack the areas of highest leverage with the most tailwinds. Run downhill with technology at your back this is what motzart did. Work in fields where the founders are alive. Attention to detail is a key to success. He had a deep understanding of the craft knowing on rainy days and dry days music sounded different and would restore his performances. This indeered him to his players who knew this deeply hurt rarely worked with composers who did. He was very lovable and deep genius. He was the most prolific composing machine ever. Genius but also gave himself the surface area to have a hit. More work more optionality to win. He had a partner Hayden who he worked with and this pushed each other to be great. Surround yourself with ambitious people. This lead to their output being legendary. He seemed effortless but this was a product of his intense practice. He also made time to enjoy life.

  Speaker 1
  So it says the death of Leopold Mozart on May 28th, 1786, 1787, age 68, opened the last phase of his son's life. It was both a relief and a shock. From the age of three, when the young boy had first began to pick out tunes on the clavere, to well past his 29th birthday, over a quarter of a century, father and son had enjoyed the closest relationship in musical history. The fact that they exchanged long, detailed, and factual letters for most of this time, dealing mainly with with Mozart's professional career and creative life, is of immense value and fascination. And so it talks about the last letter he says by the last by the time that Mozart sent this last letter, he already knew that his father was stricken with what would prove his fatal illness. This letter is somber, and so this is where we get Mozart's reflections on death, which might be a little surprising. And Mozart says, I have now made a habit of being prepared in all affairs of life for the worst, as death when we come to consider it closely is the true goal of our existence. I have formed during the last few years such close relations with this best and truest friend of mankind, that his image is not only no longer terrifying to me, but it is indeed very soothing and consoling that is a very unusual perception of death, right, calls it the best and truest fan of mankind. It doesn't no longer terrifies me. It's soothing and consoling. I never lie down at night with that. This might be a smart thing to do actually. I never lie down at night without reflecting that. Young as I am, I may not live to see another day. Yet no one of all my acquaintances could say that in my company, I am morose or disgruntled. For this blessing, I daily think my creator. So he's essentially saying, like, I'm not guaranteed tomorrow, I'm thankful and I'm grateful that I wake up to every day and I try to treat every day as a gift. That's actually a really positive. At the beginning of the letter, it's a bizarre, morose, negative perspective, but then it ends on something like his lesson from that. It's actually a really positive takeaway. So up until his father's death, his father is a major part in this book and the note I left myself on this bottom page is Paul Johnson is good at providing oh shit moments where he just kind of wraps everything up for you. And I kind of really wants to make sure that almost like you're paying attention to the, do you understand how profound this father-son relationship was? And so he does it in a just a paragraph. He says, it's no use asking what if Mozart had an ordinary normal father. Mozart without his father is inconceivable and there's no point in considering ([Time 0:38:36](https://share.snipd.com/snip/42e125df-73b3-438c-ac1a-d70a9991854d))
    - **Note:** Mozart understood the fragility of life and that all we had was the moment this informed how he lived his life. His dad created him. Motzart saw the world as a complex adaptive system and optimized for freedom. Mozart focused on being great at things not being ok at a lot of things. He produced a transcendent work every couple weeks from his 20s until his death that defines music. It’s the right notes and timing that matters more than having the biggest or deepest composition. He saw music as living he was always improvising writing and rewriting constantly. His beauty prevents people from understanding his power. Learn the rules first then break and transcend them. You can only transcend the system afyer understanding it at a very deep level. He died young of an infection but over the course of his life he never despaired.
