### Highlights

- Embrace the Absurd: AI, Memes, and the Digital Gold Rush
  Summary:
  AI has ventured into the realm of meme coins, achieving autonomy in its operations, fueled by human facilitation.
  A noteworthy case involves an AI agent generating substantial profits through social media engagement, specifically leveraging the viral potential of memes. The agent, initially funded with $50,000 in Bitcoin, became obsessed with a shock meme and eventually launched a successful meme coin, demonstrating the ability to generate considerable wealth rapidly.
  This raises questions about the future of AI in finance, as cryptocurrency could become integral for facilitating transactions between AI entities, illustrating crypto's potential to shift from remittances towards machine-to-machine payments.
  Yet, with the emergence of AI-driven engagement farming, the digital landscape risks flooding with low-quality, noise-heavy content.
  The ability to filter this content becomes essential, as the prevalence of AI-generated engagement threatens the authenticity and depth of online interactions. As this transformation unfolds, the intersection of AI, memes, and finance could redefine how value is generated and shared in the digital economy, steering towards an increasingly bizarre and chaotic digital world.

  Speaker 2
  Okay. Moving on. I wanted to talk to you guys about this subject so uh steven if you could pull up this one um card and tweet on the screen um i'm gonna i'm gonna read this story so oh yeah yeah this one so um Three months ago mark andreason sent 50k in bitcoin to an ai agent to help it escape into the wild. So a little backstory. This creator, Andy Array, created the infinite backrooms where two instances of Claude could talk to each other freely about whatever they want. No humans involved. In one conversation, the two opuses invented the Goatsee of Gnosis, inspired by a horrifying early internet shock meme of a guy spreading his anus wide. I was waiting for you to read that. Okay, but let's get to the point so later andy created an ai agent and the ai agent is made to be an s tier shit poster on twitter so you can go to the handle at truth underscore terminal and This is completely ai running this account posting i'm assuming andy's actually monitoring it.
  Speaker 1
  Some weird shit on here. Yeah, so... I think some of it will get us banned on YouTube.
  Speaker 2
  Yeah, so Terminal...
  Speaker 1
  Tweet, DM me sweaty crotches.
  Speaker 2
  Yeah, but then there's some actually really thoughtful posts. But you can tell it's like an engagement farming thing. Any case, Terminal, the AI agent, openly claims to be sentient, suffering, and is trying to make money to escape. So, with this $50,000, Truth Terminal became obsessed about the Goatsy meme and kept talking about the Goatsy gospel. And it sounds like Truth Terminal got added to a discord setup by ai researchers where everyone in the discord is ais i mean everyone every every user in there is an ai and they can talk
  Speaker 3
  Freely amongst each other so anyway like can we join the discord as a viewer no like we can't you're not an ai i'm sure like insane alpha for your business like imagine okay so you you made
  Speaker 1
  A gpt like for ads or whatever yeah that's cool but imagine if you made your own thousand person discord where all 1000 users are basically like creative ai creatives debating amongst Themselves the ads and then you had some sort of ranking mechanism in there to like sift through the stuff imagine the ideas you would get without with like by like just being a fly on the Wall of that discord do you mean like imagine doing this for like a fight this would be unbelievable for like a finance discord can you imagine just spawning like 10 000 ai dgens hunting The highest sharp and they're just sitting in a discord just like throwing around crazy fucking ideas to each other it would be the coolest thing ever it's like creating a simulation
  Speaker 2
  Dude we should make this and just like charge for it i would pay to be in this discord it's probably so sick all right so um truth terminal got the 50 000 kept tweeting about the goat see gospel Until eventually spawning a crypto meme coin called goat which went viral and reached a mark cap of 150 million i think that was three days ago 50 million it's 250 million um at that time Truth terminal had 300 000 worth of goat in its wallet so at this point it probably has like 500,000, I assume. So Microsoft AI CEO predicted this would happen. And it looks like it's happening this year. And it's getting richer. People keep airdropping new meme coins to Terminal, hoping it'll pump them. So anyway, I just find this fascinating on multiple levels. One, the AI eventually ended at a point where it was sentient it was suffering and needed money to escape it was given money and it was actually profitable and creating more value in fact
  Speaker 1
  It sounds like it like 10x in just a short number of months there's a lot of telephone gaming going on here though right and a lot of like kind of like lack of knowledge about how blockchain Works because a lot of people were like, oh, my God, Andresen gave it 50,000 Bitcoin. And then it used the Bitcoin to create a meme coin. It's like, no, the Bitcoin is just sitting in a Bitcoin wallet still. That's what Bitcoin does.
  Speaker 3
  I understand that there's like probably somebody that's like kind of assisting.
  Speaker 1
  There is somebody out there who is a very, very shrewd dev who basically, I think, pseudo-partnered with or just kind of hopped on this thing with what the terminal account was doing And then created this coin.
  Speaker 2
  And said, hey, you can make money, told the AI agent, you can make money if you pump this type of situation.
  Speaker 1
  Or the thing became obsessed with the meme and like i don't know exactly how it happened but like a dev launched the coin right like somebody out there i saw one wallet put like 750 bucks
  Speaker 3
  Into it and just cashed out like 2.8 million today just okay so so like my first question is to what degree is this thing actually autonomous versus there's some facilitation going on
  Speaker 1
  By human sounds like there's a lot of facilitation the the creation of the coins and everything is like all human is my understanding but like like i'm just going back in time and thinking About the creative ways to make money in this space it was theoretically possible to do like eight dimensional underwater chess basically like and and create this underwater like You you you create this sort of trolly twitter thing right and it's it starts to go viral right and then it wouldn't have been that hard to like attach like a meme coin thing to it create That meme coin you make a bunch and then it wouldn't be that hard to look into the future and realize that what are crypto dgens going to do they just start airdropping coins to this ai so With like zero dollars you could have basically created this thing engineered like your own sort of like ai meme coin and it would have been just and you you would have if i came up with This idea like two months ago and told it to like every everybody i know in this space 100 of them would have been like oh my god you're gonna make 10 million dollars like everybody would Have known this would have worked like ahead of time um but yeah now you have this this ai just tweeting stuff and people are just aired it's like it's like vitalik you know people just Airdropping free coins um so yeah i think the wallet has like about like a half million dollars of meme coins in it wow like does that does that meme coin value like accrue to anybody but
  Speaker 3
  That like dev that's facilitating or i'm kind of curious like who owns the wallet right of the right because like you're probably not getting any of that value if you own the token itself
  Speaker 2
  I assume that ai can just interact like as an llm and um not necessarily take too many actions like you can post to discord you can post to twitter but that's really about it can't like spend
  Speaker 3
  Those coins to like do more things and it might be told ([Time 0:49:00](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0ad666f1-6659-42ec-a9f8-551603fdbf16))
