    - **Note:** Jimi was always practicing always getting his work in. He loved his craft and was deeply committed. This made him the best guitar player of his time a legit monopoly. His personal life was very hard and he just wanted to play guitar he slept on floors and streets with the singular focus of being the best guitar player. He did not want money just enough to play guitar and this unintended consequence partly destroyed him
      People are in cages with open doors
