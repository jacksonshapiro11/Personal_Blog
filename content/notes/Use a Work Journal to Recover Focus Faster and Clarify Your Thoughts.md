### Highlights

- Mitch called me to ask for that doc again, which I gave him, not without mentioning that little “star” icon in the url bar. And then got back at it.
  And boy oh boy did that help! I just re-read what I was doing, and boom! I was back in.
  I started listing all the commands I was running, and their results. Writing down my train of thoughts, the things I was doing and what I wanted to do next. And I have been doing that for the past 3-4 months. I feel like I invented something new. It helps me think more clearly, and restore the context so, so much faster when I switch between things. I’m almost looking forward to an interruption to get a chance to marvel again at my genius!
  Except that it’s nothing new, right? “Writing helps you organize your thoughts more clearly”: everyone and their grandmother know that! Writing a plan, writing a diary? People keep listing how transformative that’s been for them. I’m not proposing a new framework. I’m just saying - every movie has a scientist recording themselves on one of these shitty little cassette recorders. They might be onto something. Write notes of what you’re doing and what you’re thinking. When you drop the pen and get back at it, read the last bit. That’s it.
  I’ve just been too lazy to ever do it. Or not necessarily lazy, but more: I didn’t trust the tool enough to think it was a good use of my time, and instead just mash on the keyboard till it works. After all, I’m writing pages of text, of which I will never read more than a fraction. But that’s not the point. The point is structure, and the point is caching.
  I guess that’s kind of it: if you’re having trouble switching between things or getting focused, try writing what you’re doing, and read the last couple sentences when you resume. Maybe it will help you. Maybe it won’t. Or maybe I’m an idiot who needs crutches. But hey, who knows! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3ba1e1wa44tzjk37jrd3e2f))
    - **Note:** keep a running document of what you're doing and your thinking at the moment and then use that if you get distracted to drop things off and pick things up. Write down stream of consciousness circle the important and timely things and if you get distracted you can jog your memory
