### Highlights

- People need to testify to their beliefs ie the engineer should be on the plane and we need a margin of safety
    - **Tags:** #ownership-(take/create), #risk-and-return, #margin-of-saftey, #incentive-structures, #allign-incentives
    - **Note:** We need people to own their ideas.
- Getting rid of bad things is much better than adding good things. Getting rid of smoking lengthens life expectancy more than every medical advance since ww2
    - **Tags:** #inversion, #utopia-(issues-with), #good-intentions-(have-caused-more-suffering-than-anything), #self-determinism, #first-dont-lose-then-win
    - **Note:** This is similar to poppers idea of utopia by getting rid of evil instead of pursuing good then let each person decide what good means to them
- Things that are natural are assumed robust and ok if they have been done for decades but things that are new have to prove their worth over a long time horizon. Intervention and new medicine has a high burden of proof
    - **Tags:** #innovation, #system-construction, #lindy-effect, #antifragile
    - **Note:** We assume the Lindy of nature but place a higher burden of proof on new inventions
- Time destroys all lindy effect benefits of natural things and fractals bottom up is better than top down because top down is so hard
    - **Tags:** #long-term-mindset, #bottoms-up-not-top-down, #lindy-effect, #emergent-behavior
    - **Note:** Time Carrie’s much of the weight and it’s easy to be bottom up vs top down you have to be right about a lot more the other is more emergent.
- You should look for key reasons or root causes to validate or invalidate someone ie if someone is a serial killer that’s enough to to invalidate them as a good person without knowing much else
    - **Tags:** #root-vs-proximate-cause
    - **Note:** Look for root not proximate causes
- Knowing something is wrong is more powerful than proving it is right because with more evidence right can become wrong but for wrong to become right is a lot harder
    - **Tags:** #truth-seeking-(vs-being-right), #objective-truth, #critical-approach-(conjectures-and-refutations), #hold-beliefs-lightly
    - **Note:** Objective truth may be unattainable so we should constantly criticize our ideas to grow.
- Positive randomness payoff is the square of the square function. The squared payoff of the function is higher than the payoff squared for ie rolling a dice free money but the square root function is concave square of the square root payoff is different than the payoff of the square roots squared
    - **Tags:** #trends-(riding-the-wave), #randomness, #convexity, #risk-and-return, #asymmetric-outcomes
    - **Note:** This doesn't make a ton of sense maybe i am an idiot but make sure you play the right games and expose yourself to positive tail convexity.
- Average is good but must be paired with variability to get the right picture
    - **Tags:** #mean-vs-deviation, #perspective-taking
- 3 categories those that like randomness are neutral to it and dislike it
    - **Tags:** #emergent-behavior, #randomness, #antifragile, #tail-risk
- Negative convexity and randomness are bad because things with negative convexity will have proportionally worse outcomes for the same amount of risk ie traffic being light leads ri you showing up 5 minutes early but being heavy 50 minutes late risk return
    - **Tags:** #motivation, #definitions, #convexity, #risk-and-return, #asymmetric-outcomes, #randomness, #tail-risk, #favorite, #lottery-tickets, #expected-value, #mean-vs-deviation, #negative-convexity, #risk-control-vs-avoidance
    - **Note:** Negative convexity is when the best case is exceeded in magnitude by the worst case. A flight can only be early by 30 minutes to maybe an hour but it can be delayed or cancelled. Avoid these bad risk return trade offs when randomness is added and a wider range of outcomes your wipe out risk is higher.
      Avoid asymmetric downside and when randomness is high that downside is more likely. Negative convexity likewise select for volatility when you have upside.
- Asymmetric risk and scale. When risk is even but pay offs are non linear the important news of scale and how some systems scale up and down as power laws a big Boulder has a different effect than that bolder broken into 1 mm pieces
    - **Tags:** #scale, #power-law, #risk-and-return, #non-linear-effects
- Don’t put theories into practice develop theories from practice
    - **Tags:** #good-explanations, #science-starts-with-problems
- We are narrative seeking creatures but the world doesn’t need narratives dint conflate two different things because the narrative makes sense ie war in the middle east with oil prices or a pandemic with a long market drop
    - **Tags:** #bias-(engrained/unnoticed), #stories-we-tell-ourselves, #narratives, #anomalies, #psychological-biases
    - **Note:** We need to create stories to make sense of the world but the world is just events and narratives are irrelevant.
- Guy who traded green lumber thought it was green you didn’t need the complex models to trade but a deep domain understanding
    - **Tags:** #focus-on-what's-important, #domain-dependence, #games-(understand-the-game-you-are-playing)
    - **Note:** Focus on what's important. He didn't need to understand what is was just how it fit within the system.
- Scholarship and education are different you don’t need to have a formal education to learn. Ideas of cause and effect are sometimes backwards education has resulted from wealth poor countries who increase wealth increase education but poor countries who increase education don’t increase wealth
    - **Tags:** #lifelong-learning, #personal-curriculum
    - **Note:** Education is a personal process that only you can under take not schools who can guide but ultimately do nothing.
- Domain dependency when recognizing things is important and so is understanding path dependency it’s easy to see an option contract on a stock but hard to see the same exact metrics in another area recognize the signs and then execute the plan ie another one of those
    - **Tags:** #mental-models, #domain-dependence, #path-dependence
    - **Note:** Domain dependency can blind us to certain mental models, but we need to look at a deep level to see structural similarities.
- Buy optionality when possible if you can get a free or cheap option do it. Everything good and bad is driven by the tails so push out there could be very good or bad variation is good an average of 50 with no variation is very different when variation is added
    - **Tags:** #convexity, #mean-vs-deviation, #positive-optionality, #favorite, #optionality, #tail-risk, #power-law, #antifragile, #free-options, #exposure-yourself-to-positive-convexity, #buy-optionality
    - **Note:** Being long tail outcomes an optionality is key to expose yourself to big upside. Realize that you can take moonshots especially when cheap in some regards and expose yourself to positive convexity
- Barbell mitigate fragility risk to you don’t ruin and maximize exposure to upside with small calculated bets. Balancing life instead of being in the middle with mitigated upside but not fully mitigated downside. Remove risk of ruin expose yourself to additional risk
- Wait before action especially when emotionally charged so kind deeds because these can’t be taken away
    - **Tags:** #emotions-cloud-judgement, #emotional-consistey, #kindness, #empathy/sympathy-(understand-others-perspective), #be-kind-to-others
    - **Note:** Be nice to others and take a deep breath before an emotionally charged decision.
- Don’t view the catalyst as a cause it’s more the straw that breaks the camels back after a lot of garbage has build in the system
    - **Tags:** #activation-energy, #catalyst, #system-vulnerabilities
    - **Note:** Catalyst is activation energy not systematic problem
- Naive intervention means intervening without thought intervention isn’t bad but it should be purposeful and careful to make the system stronger not short term optimization
    - **Tags:** #long-term-mindset, #naive-intervention, #systems-thinking, #system-intervention
- Stability doesn’t make a system resilient to an outsized risk so the garbage just builds in the system which is bad. We want stability but eventually smaller shocks that we avoid leads to a larger earthquake
    - **Tags:** #fragility-in-systems, #stability-in-uncertainty, #antifragile, #resilience-vs-stability
    - **Note:** Stability. Hides fragility. Resilience versus stability.
- Adding randomness to a system can strengthen it ie shaking it could avoid settling a local max in search of a global max
    - **Tags:** #grow-through-hardship, #local-vs-global-maximum, #pressure-creates-diamonds
- Risk of a distributed system is different than a centralized one ie all systems have different risk profiles. Fixing prices with high monitoring of the market leads to mostly good times with huge downside eventually bill comes due
    - **Tags:** #markets, #risk-and-return, #favorite, #hidden-built-up-risks, #decentralized/centralized-systems, #fragility-in-systems, #tail-risk, #risk-profiles, #trade-offs, #diversity-(within-systems)
    - **Note:** Different system designs have different design trade offs that create different benefits and fragilities. Hidden built up risks.
- Risk for extreme events is in the future not past so need to be anticipated from the present not abstracted from the past interesting note on human thinking
    - **Tags:** #emergent-behavior, #crisis-(the-next-wont-be-like-the-last), #tail-risk
    - **Note:** We abstract from the past when the next crisis is emergent and wont be like the last
- Extremistan is when one event drives outcomes ie black swans and financial crashes mediocristan is when outcomes are driven by daily random variation but the system can’t be overhauled in a day ie weight you can’t double your weight in a day or even a month but you can 10x your network in a day. Absence of evidence is nothing evidence of absence know the unknown unknowns ie the turkey diesnr know about thanksgiving but this fact is key to their life
    - **Tags:** #unknown-unknowns, #ignorant-of-our-ignorance, #signal-vs-noise, #favorite, #tail-risk, #risk-and-return, #systems-thinking, #extreme-outcomes, #definitions, #years-when-decades-happen, #power-law, #mediocrastan, #absence-of-evidence-vs-evidence-of-absence
    - **Note:** Tails can drive outcomes one day can have a bigger effect than an entire decade. We cannot be ignorant of our ignorance. Absence of evidence vs evidence of absence. Understanding what systems are exposed to extreme tail risk and which ones are not. Embrace positive tails avoid negative ones.
- Bottom up systems lead to less of an ability to be swayed by special interests or abstract statistical decisions because those who make decisions have more distrubuted power and that leads to on the whole more ownership of decisions because they know their constituents
    - **Tags:** #decentralization, #bottoms-up-not-top-down, #incentive-structures, #ownership-(take/create)
    - **Note:** Bottom up and distributed power leads to more ownership and aligned incentives because there is clear and direct benefit and harm instead of abstract
- Professions that benefit from randomness give you optionality ie taxi driver you can be your own boss and choose your areas of improvement smooth steady with large shocks ie wipe out risk is worse than high variability and often shocks without career wipe out risk small mistakes help people learn but could hurt someone in a less dynamic open system ie small mistake in white color job can linger forever
    - **Tags:** #antifragile, #long/short-term-incentive-misalignment, #career-advice, #black-swans, #grow-through-hardship
    - **Note:** Expose your life to benefit from randomness without swipe out risk. You want to grow from hardship and avoid small built up risks that fuck you. Your day to day comfort can lead to long term failure vs grinding every day leading to success
- Procrustean bed when you cut or stretch something to fit a scale instead of dynamically scaling the system to the inputs leads to fragility
    - **Tags:** #procrustean-bed, #systems-thinking, #mental-flexability, #fragility-in-systems, #scale
- Take your own risk humans may have to die or fail for the success of the species but we should celebrate the failures as long as they die honorably on their sword
    - **Tags:** #failure-(as-a-necessary-part-of-learning), #value-creation, #expected-value, #risk-and-return, #volatility, #risk-profiles
    - **Note:** Risk seeking in positive ev kills people but overall helps the species.
- Good systems are built to allow small independent mistakes that will help the system without causing future harm ie airlines while economic systems small mistakes can compound and be hidden but eventually the bill comes due. One crashed plane leads to procedures making another less likely but one store failure makes another who depends on it in the interconnected network more likely increasing fragility. Those who don’t introspect or exploit their mistakes for future gain but instead tries to satisfice and provide bs explanations is an idiot those who do will grow and be successful don’t feel defensive feel enriched with new info don’t be a victim those who have made many errors but not the same one twice is more reliable than those who have never eered
    - **Tags:** #antifragile, #risk-and-return, #value-creation, #systems-thinking, #failure-(as-a-necessary-part-of-learning), #favorite, #system-vs-point-change, #system-construction, #grow-through-hardship, #definitions, #decentralized-experiments, #decentralized/centralized-systems, #good-system-design, #learn-from-mistakes, #writing-topics, #success-=-mistakes-well-handled, #exploit-your-mistakes, #failure-(only-is-a-lack-of-knowledge), #failure-(don't-let-it-compound), #introspection
    - **Note:** Good systems allow for independent failures that can be integrated for the better of the whole while back systems enable and encourage the compounding of failure. On leads to fragility the other anti fragility. Make mistakes embrace, failure, introspect, and get better.
      Decentralized experiments vs systematic failure. Exploit your mistakes.
- We need stressors to build anti fragility. In complex adaptive systems it’s very hard to find cause and effect you need to understand the states of the system and how/why they might change and adapt accordingly
    - **Tags:** #pressure-creates-diamonds, #grow-through-hardship, #antifragile, #complex-adaptive-systems
- Stressors with recovery is important for the growth of biological systems all publicity is good publicity dint make yourself fragile and subject to the opinions of the mob make yourself interesting and rise above that
    - **Tags:** #pressure-creates-diamonds, #stress-is-good, #grow-through-hardship
    - **Note:** You need stress for growth.
- Assume worst harm is possible don’t use the past build resilience not to the high of the last worst thing
    - **Tags:** #antifragile, #tail-risk, #critical-approach-(conjectures-and-refutations), #favorite, #future, #crisis-(the-next-wont-be-like-the-last), #models-(create-false-confidence), #black-swans
    - **Note:** Our future tail risk should not be defined by past tail risk but should use conjecture and criticism to understand the true worst case scenario. Black swans resiliency in systems.
- In certain domains we see something one way but in another domain we might see it differently ie lifting weights vs lifting luggage create strong mental models and transfer concepts
    - **Tags:** #domain-dependence, #mental-models, #cross-disciplinary, #bias-(inherent-in-models)
- Fragile is less mistakes with greater magnitude anti fragile likes mistakes usually small and leads to improvement
