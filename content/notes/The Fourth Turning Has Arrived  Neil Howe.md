    - **Note:** Generational forgetting we forget how to do thing and how bad things were over time. Currently people are afraid of their own shadows because easy times create weak people. This is why cycles exists because of generational forgetting. The bad thing is this ends in war and strife but crisis creates opportunities to learn and grow which is good for peoples growth.
- Generational Agent and the Concept of Generational Forgetting
  Summary:
  Each generation carries values and behaviors from its youth to its grave, adapting and changing but keeping a basic life framework intact.
  As generations age and pass away, they take with them the memories and experiences of past crises. This generational forgetting phenomenon makes crisis management difficult, as those who recall past crises and behaviors that worked are no longer present.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Or or view contains a an implicit explanation, and that is it is generational agent, and that each generation, whence it comes of age, takes those values and those behaviors with it To his grave, to a certain extent, ra it doesn't really change after that. It adapts, obviouslya it changes. It gets older. It has given responsibilities as it gets older, but its basic framework and lioking at life remains the same. And and so what happens is it eventually, the generation which rends things passes away. Ah. And every time you have a crisis, what you find is every one who any living memory of the last crisis is gone. So you wonder why we find it so hard to manage a crisis? Well, every one that recalls having any right impact on it, or whose were invested in the kinds of behaviour that got ess tog the earlier one, has disappeared. Well, nowi it's a very powerful venim i now im ly agree with you.
  Speaker 2
  I mean, at that concept of generational forgetting. I think it's so, so powerful. So look, the title of your your magnum opas. I'm sure oullhave more magnum opi after but is the fourth turning, right? And that's the phrase that many people listening to this podcast will be familiar with, you know. ([Time 0:23:24](https://share.snipd.com/snip/adc754de-9155-4482-8fcf-6407ffcd20d5))
    - **Note:** Generational forgetting leads to future crisis because these happen on generational time scales and societally we forget how people who weren’t us dealt with similar issues. These times of great generational strife happen every 4 generations or turnings creating intense strife and this is when most of the progress is made then oscifies over time. Chaos creates opportunity for change. We fight change in times of piece and push amazing things through like social security or broad public school or constitution during strife that was during WW2 civil war and revolution respectively
- Participation in community through generational perspectives and global conflicts
  Summary:
  Younger generations feel disconnected from community participation due to lack of institutional encouragement.
  The current conflicts in Ukraine reflect a shift where ordinary citizens are participating in something bigger. Historical insights from World War II highlight a different national feeling and existential threat faced by nations.
  The delay in response to crises like in Ukraine may stem from a sense of indifference and powerlessness.
  The rise of populist leaders globally challenges the assumption that democracy is the only path to order and security.
  Millennials express a growing distrust in democracy, feeling it primarily benefits the older and wealthier population.

  Speaker 1
  A. There's no way in which a younger people are asked to do things for the community, really, except you ought and volunteer, kind of on your own, right? But there's no institutions which really encourage that. I mean, even military is now sort of mercenary, you kno w sort you know, we we hire a select bunch of people go out and do these things. I think, actually, it's fashinate. One thing i've seen millennials rudely respond to are all these videos ind ucrane of these guys saying, i used to be a cook, i used to be a poet, i used to be a health care worker, but now av On fighting and o wheny they they got 30 seconds instruction taus to the calecniko, you know, and a bunch of bullets, and they're opt of the i think that has been an absolute tifany from Alanst. It's like, yes, just people like us, we're suddenly being asked to participate in something bigger. I and i, i thinktets fited, sort of, you know, an interesting insight into what makes what's happening in the ukraine so fascinating to as ordinary citizens can make that difference. And i do think that that's the tragedy. But, you know, that's another thing that the fourth turning solves, because ultimately it cannot help but give this generation an opportunity, although many of them, albeit a sto Ma belated one, a. The same was true of olgor too, by the way, to to a to fulfil you know, tose those ambitions, to to do something profound, to actually change their community, this country, possibly een The world, rather than just spend all your time, you know, for some boss, you know, improving there. You know, you don't brand attractiveness on some b s product that nobody cares about.
  Speaker 2
  I'm with you. I, you know, part of what you stud is really resident. I my grandpa fought in regi or two. I've recently, i've known that, i recently learned from my mam, that he left college with one semester left to go volunteer to fight in the war. And that blew my mind, because i just can't imagine doing that. I i can't imagine what he must have felt like at that time, because that's such a foreign feeling for me. I suppose it was just stark reminder that, like mana, it must have just been a really different national feeling at that given point of time.
  Speaker 1
  Well, remember that, tom, you know, america. It wasn't, it wasn't like any of the kinds of conflicts that we fought, we'v seen in our lifetimes, right? This was a conflict that seemed existentialom, you remember that i i an dominated the pacific. I dominated the indian ocean. I just and nd and the ac in our germany, italy, i completely kind of waked out any opposition on the mainland europe, and was moving intoai, was moving intoto, the soviet union. It looked as though i, you know, f t ar did that. In his fireside chats, he talkd about how whence one's briton goes, here are the various ways in which the germans could kind of come into greenland, if they gon to come over into brazil. And, you know, we don't have any effective navy. We don't have any effect, if dit, to stop anyone from doing anything right now. A, and it was, and it was u existential. And i think the other question wa if we, if there are no other democracies in the world, riht, which at that time, we were practically just down to us. Ah, and a few other, you know, angliphone countries, i like, you know, canada and australia. But the question was, who would help us any more, right? You know? And, and so thers is great, and there's a litl bitof feeling about that about ukrane. Ah, the sense that we waited so long to respond, we looked the other way. We really didn't want to see it, right? And you have a, you know, you have a latimer putton in russia whose, you know, openly assassinated people in other countries all around the world, and everyone kind of knows it. Ah, and he's the tactics we're now seeing, by the way, new crane. Ah, im just bringing in allof the, you know, the russian artillery and just blasting cities into submission. Well, heren, he did those. He's es demonstrated tos. He did those ingroge when he whent he ad subdued chechnia. And and he did that. Andr help to organize it in innaside. Syria just loke what they did to alepa, right? I mean, they just brought in and they basically just blasted to smitherens e, they didn't terror tactics was part of it. Ah. But my point is, we all saw it. We even created red lines. You remember, you remember the famous red line. But we chose to ignore it because we thought, well, it was always an exception. You know, i'll come to reason and thi history is moving basically the other way, right? And i think suddenly we brak opan, see, no, maybe history isn't moving that way.
  Speaker 2
  You know, look round the world.
  Speaker 1
  Who's running governments around the world?
  Speaker 2
  Usi realization too, fresi, i hade this realization too recently. It's like men, you know, ii live in a bubble. I live in america, live in the northeast of america. And i realized recently, as like, why when you look around the other great powers, not all democracies at all, actually, but some of its, some of the biggest ones.
  Speaker 1
  I mean, you see that a lot of the large countries of the world who are run by kind of populace who appeal only to the sort of ethno centre of ther country, a norendramodi and shejin bank was Stretched out with us two. Then you had to, you know, then you had russia, then you had a whole bunch of other countries. And you begin to realize, i you know, from from central and easter europe and many of the additional ones in southeast asia, you cald add, and you begin to realize this is not where history Has to endright? And that, and by the way, this millennial quest for order and for security and for the collective can be by an authoritarian regime as well as by a democracy. Don't assume that these traits necessarily lead to a democracy. And in fact, i would say that the the hisis millennial. These millennial attitudes, we notice rit of wanting more collectivized social systems and more security, ah, rather than just always opportune ais global.

    - **Note:** Millennials don’t want freedom but security. People just want to be told what to do and be subservient instead of taking risk. Hard times creafe strong people ect.
