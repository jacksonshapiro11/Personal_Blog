- Summary: We are influenced by the moods of those around us, often without realizing it. Instead of mirroring negative vibes, we can choose to be a "thermostat" and set a positive tone in conversations. By noticing shifts in energy and using calm communication, we can help others feel more comfortable and understood.

### Highlights

- Thermometer vs thermostat
  I like to use the metaphor of a thermometer and a thermostat for this idea. If you’re looking for signals about how someone is feeling, it’s kind of like you’re trying to take their emotional temperature. You’re being a thermometer. When they’re subtly giving off weird vibes—they’re frowning, answering your questions with fewer words than normal, etc.—you’ve noticed that their temperature is different. When their amygdala is hijacked, you might see large changes in their behavior (they’re picking a fight with you, going completely silent, skipping your meeting, etc.)—in the thermometer metaphor, they’re running a fever, and you’re picking up on it.
  And since we know that one person’s behavior change can cause *others* to change their behavior in response, we can think of it like they’re being a thermostat: they’re setting the whole temperature for the room. Even if it’s unintentional on both sides. It’s just how we’re wired: to mirror the “vibes” that someone else is giving off.
  Rather than let that cycle play out subconsciously, you have an opportunity to become the thermostat as soon as you notice that another person’s temperature has changed. **You** get to set the new temperature of the room, in a positive and healthy way.

    - **Note:** curate the vibes of a conversation don't just be along for the ride. Use your agency to direct it maybe you need to bring up the elephant in the room. Body language and tone is vital. When you need to be there for someone being in control doesn't mean dominating it could mean ceeding power too
