- Embrace the Unplanned for Meaningful Moments
  Summary:
  To experience deeply meaningful moments, one must be willing to care less about structuring time for significance and instead allow moments to unfold naturally.
  The pursuit of meaning cannot be achieved through mere productivity or completing tasks. True fulfillment often arises in hindsight or in flow states, where the conscious effort of self-analysis dissipates.
  A sense of purpose emerges during times when choice is limited, often in crisis situations where one knows exactly how to help others without hesitation.
  Relationships, especially with others, are pivotal in defining joy and meaning, despite the inherent challenges they present.
  Even those who identify as introverts find that true joy often resides in connection with others. Attempts to isolate oneself with all desires met, such as on a metaphorical desert island, reveal that happiness heavily depends on interpersonal connections. Engaging with other consciousnesses forces individuals to confront their limitations and the complexities of life that cannot be managed through intellect alone. Meaningful experiences often require collaboration and cannot be tailored solely to personal agendas, as they involve the unpredictability and richness that arise from shared human experiences.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  You do have to be willing to just sort of care a bit less about whether a given afternoon, given weekend is spent in a deeply meaningful way in order to maximize the chances of it sort of Lucking out into one of those deeply meaningful times because you need to not be fixated on trying to force the matter.
  Speaker 2
  And what do you think that means? I mean, is that something that can only be appreciated in retrospect, or is that something that will also be appreciated in the moment? You mean the sense of meaning? Is that what you're talking about? Yeah, this experience that I think we're acknowledging we want, we're acknowledging that we want to feel a certain way. Yeah. And I think you're doing a pretty good job establishing, especially for anybody who's tried, you're not going to achieve that sense of meaning by achieving. Getting more things done on the to-do list is not going to be the path to make that happen. And so what is that thing that we're trying to make happen? And do we know it when it's happening?
  Speaker 1
  Huh, that's a really good question that I don't know that I really know what I think about. Certainly just in my immediate direct experience, the best times in life are either best in recollection in hindsight, or they are, you know, flow states in the moment, which as we know From flow states, right? It's like it's, can you be aware that you're in them? I think in some bodily sense, you can be aware that you're in them, but you're not in them once you're thinking too hard about them in a verbal way. I don't know if it's quite the same point, but maybe it connects. I think that one of the strangest parts of this is that is that happiness feels like sort of the wrong framing for what we're talking about here. I'm always really, really fascinated by those moments in people's lives. And I've had a couple of them myself where somebody close to you is going through some sort of immediate, serious crisis. There's nothing good about what's happening. If you could have chosen for it not to be happening, it wouldn't be happening. And then in the middle of this emergency, you, it's just obvious that you've got some, your job is to like, I don't know, do their dry cleaning. It might not be being a shoulder to cry on. It depends. You know, it might be your job is something very mundane to just make your contribution to somebody weathering this crisis. And that sense of knowing that you're in exactly the right place, that there is no question. It makes you realize how I feel, among my friends, I have a good reputation of being quite good in a crisis, which feels very flattering until you think about it. What it really means is you're just incredibly ambivalent and indecisive in all other times, right? It's when you have a choice about what you should be doing. There is this great sense of sort of second guessing and fretting and being indecisive. And yet I think we all have these experiences when there isn't really a choice, when choice is taken away, when it's incredibly obvious what you should be doing to help in that moment, Which are in some sense deeply fulfilling, even though they're not happy. And I think there's a clue there to what we're looking for in other times of life. It is this sense that there's not really any option of manipulating our experience, fitting a few more things in, worrying whether we're missing out on something else, all that sort Of goes away in those times. I don't know if it's the same point, but it does seem really important to me.
  Speaker 2
  Can that exist without some interaction with another person? Because the example you gave requires another person. In this case, it requires that you are there to help another person. I want to talk much more about the use of time as a good versus a shared good, but we'll come to that because I think that's one of the most important points of the book. And there are many. But as I sort of rack my brain to think about the most joyful moments, and I say this as a 10 out of 10 introvert, I mean, I need endless amounts of time by myself to function. If I don't have that, I come off the rails. But the truest joy I have, even as a 10 out of 10 introvert, is with others. And it makes me wonder is what we're talking about here so much about the relationship of not just time, but time with others. I'll give you an example. I play this game with patients where I sort of say like, if you could be in perfect health indefinitely, we're going to grant you eternal life. But you have to do it on a desert island. Now it's a great desert island because you don't have to find your own coconuts. Like everything you want is there. So we've somehow solved every problem. And away from the island, there are robots churning away, giving you everything you need. So you've got your Netflix, you've got your food, you've got your to your heart's content, you can have anything. The only thing you can't have is another human being. Are you happy? And most people, when they think about this for just a few minutes, come to the conclusion, no, it would be very difficult to be happy. Whatever we define happiness is, that's such a sloppy word. But fill in the blank, your positive valence, very difficult. I mean, what do you think of that? And what does that tell us here?
  Speaker 1
  Super interesting. I think it's basically right. I think that we're talking about things that can only happen in some form of relationship. I would say that there probably can be such a thing as your relationship with parts of yourself. That I think when people are journaling, for example, they are maybe in a relation with unconscious parts of themselves. I think you can be in relationship with the natural world in certain ways. But by and large, I think you're right that the deepest ways in which we're in relationship are with other people. And I mean, there's a million different angles to endorse that point. It stated like that. It doesn't sound super controversial. I think where it connects to what I'm so interested in and I'm writing about in the book is that there's a sense in which other people, other consciousnesses are kind of, in some way, they're Sort of an affront to any idea that we can use our intellect to control our world. Because as soon as you're in any kind of even slightly intimate relationship, friendship with somebody else, it's like people have their own agendas. You're brought into an encounter with your limits because you can't just make the rhythms of family life go exactly as you want them to do. If you manage that, you find everyone else is very miserable and that's not what you wanted. So we're sort of brought into this encounter with the fact that we are these finite beings. And I think that's really important and edifying for us somehow because part of what is goin... ([Time 0:25:07](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2aec9372-9cc2-4036-ac0a-60fcad310d18))
    - **Note:** Being fully present in hardship can be a good model for life. We can only have happiness in relationships to others. We should want to live a full life and get to the end happy that likely comes through relationships with others. Times value is only truly realized when shared.
- Prioritize to Simplify Life
  Summary:
  Establishing clear priorities in life is crucial for simplifying one’s existence.
  By creating a ranked list of the top 25 meaningful goals, individuals should focus their time and energy exclusively on the top five. The remaining 20, while still significant, can distract from these primary goals and should be avoided to prevent unnecessary stress and overextension.
  Recognizing that it's impossible to achieve everything not only liberates individuals from the burden of unrealistic expectations but also fosters a healthier perspective on life.
  Embracing the finitude of human capability allows for a more engaged approach to the possible, leading to a more satisfying and meaningful existence.
  This acceptance of limitations enables individuals to concentrate on what truly matters, enhancing both productivity and well-being.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Yeah. And when people come up with like wise sayings, it's either Confucius or the Buddha or Warren Buffett, basically, who gets them attributed to them. Right. He's allegedly asked, how should I sort of set my priorities in life? And he replied that you should make a list of the 25 things that matter to you most in your life goals, priorities, rank them in order from one to 25. And the top five are the ones that you should sort of pour your time and energy and attention into. But the next 20, and this is where most of us might come to a different conclusion, right? Many people might say, well, the next 20, those are kind of pretty important. So whenever you get a little corner of time, do something on one of those. And he says, no, those 20 are the ones you should avoid at all costs, because they're the ones that matter to you enough to lure you away from the top five, but don't matter to you enough To be the top five. Even in this story, there is a little bit of not quite facing the truth of the matter, I think, because it could simply be that there are many, many things that all belong in the top five, More than five things. I mean, you're still implying that you can do that ranking. But I think what's so important about it as a way of approaching life is that it doesn't ask you to believe that everything you're going to decide to not do, that all the things you're going To neglect, you have to convince yourself didn't really matter in the first place. It's like, no, they did really matter. It would have been good. To do those things. But finitude, our state as humans demands that we make some choices anyway. And actually, I think it's very comforting in the end, right? Because if you feel that you want to not only be great in your work and be a great parent and pursue a couple of like leisure activities, but also do these other 20 things, and you feel that There must be a way of doing it. That's a very tormenting way to live. When you see that like, oh, right, there's just always going to be more that I want to be doing than that I can be doing. I think that actually allows you to let go of some of those other things, to see that it's just our job as human beings, to like pick a handful of the things that really compel us and focus On them, rather than to somehow make infinity fit into a finite container.
  Speaker 2
  What is it that you sort of realized circa 2014, you write about this sort of moment of clarity. I think you were sitting on a bench somewhere in Brooklyn. Oh, yeah. Prospect Park. Yeah. Yeah. How did this sort of coalesce for you then?
  Speaker 1
  This was very much on the sort of productivity and work side of this whole thing. And it was a kind of an intellectual epiphany. I don't know. You might resonate with this, right? You can sometimes figure things out in an intellectual level. And then it takes kind of years to live into them in a real way. So it wasn't like my life changed that moment, but it was a winter morning in the middle of the week, I had like a huge, even more number of larger number of things I felt like I had to do by The end of that week than normal. And I was on my way to my co-working space where I worked then in Brooklyn. Sitting on this bench, like trying to game it out, trying to figure out like what combination of scheduling and what order I could do things in and how I could make it work to really power Through and actually get to the end of all these things that felt like obligations for that week. And just suddenly being struck by the thought, the understanding that like, Oh, it's impossible. Oh, I see. I'm trying to do something impossible. And feeling that as a sort of like a burden being lifted, right? In that moment, it's like, Oh, right. I can't be expected to find a way to do all this. I've taken on more things than I can do in the time that I felt I had to do them. And maybe there are going to be some downsides to having to renegotiate things or fail to meet some deadlines. But then I'm going to have to deal with those downsides because, you know, there's no alternative. And I find this to be, I think it runs through a lot of what we're talking about here, a lot of what I've written, maybe this move where you sort of see that your problem is worse than you thought It was. And that is incredibly liberating because you go from thinking that you face an incredibly hard challenge to seeing that actually it's not really hard. It's impossible. And the shift from really hard to impossible is actually quite important because you can stop beating yourself up for not being able to do something impossible. And I'm thinking now just in terms of what you were saying before about the initial motivations for your interest in the physical stuff, I think there's a similar liberation to go through, Right? And seeing like finding a way to live forever, that's impossible. Then you drop through into the ground of, okay, we can work on that certainly one can maximize one's chances of a longer life. You can certainly maximize the quality of the life that you have, but you sort of drop away from that kind of me against the universe thing that you can throw years of energy into, but you're Never actually going to win. And then there's something much more engaged with the world about being in the realm of the possible, right? Because then you're like getting stuck in. I don't know if that, do people say getting stuck in in America? I don't know. But in Britain, that's the idiom, right? It's like getting actually into the activity of doing real things in the world.

    - **Note:** Write down the top 25 most important things in your life and then ignore the bottom 20 and focus on the top 5. Infinite things finite life. Don’t worry about the impossible focus on the possible. Don’t lie to yourself burden being lifted.
- Embrace the Ordinary: Finding Meaning in Life's Simplicity
  Summary:
  Dropping the need for life to have extraordinary cosmic significance can be liberating, allowing individuals to focus on the meaningfulness of everyday experiences.
  This perspective counters the nihilistic view that life is meaningless, suggesting that true purpose can be found in small, personal interactions and responsibilities, like being a good parent or neighbor. Setting unrealistic standards for meaning leads to unnecessary dissatisfaction; instead, by defining meaning in relatable and attainable ways, such as influencing those directly around us, we affirm the value of our lives.
  The urgency that comes with this realization often results in a paradox; heightened awareness of limited time with loved ones can lead to overwhelming pressure to maximize every moment.
  Embracing a more grounded approach to meaning focuses on cultivating human connections rather than aspiring to unattainable ideals.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So in the section of the book on cosmic insignificant therapy, I'm sort of first of all explaining how I feel that it's very, it can be very energizing and empowering to sort of drop the Requirement, the inner requirement that we everything we do in our lives has to be sort of extraordinarily important on a grand scale. Because obviously, if you zoom out far enough, you can make anybody's life completely unimportant. And you can do that with like Mozart, if you zoom out far enough. I mean, some people might be remembered for several thousand years, but just make it a million years instead. So there's nothing we can do that matters in that sense. And I think that can be very liberating. It means that if you're prone to indecision and spending time feeling like you've got to do things exactly right, then it's a good reminder that doesn't matter enough to worry about. But yes, then of course, the risk is that you're sort of lifted out of that terrible kind of like, Oh, no, am I doing things extraordinarily enough with my life? Am I getting things right? Or am I going the wrong way? You're lifted out of it so far that it becomes sort of lighter than air. And it's like, why am I even here? What's the point? I've been really, really influenced here by the work of a philosopher called Ido Landau who wrote a book called Finding Meaning in an Imperfect World. One of the points I take him to be making there is just like, it's quite strange that when it comes to thinking about what meaning is, what purpose is, we insist on using these criteria That either no human, or maybe in some cases, sort of a tiny number of humans in each generation could ever hope to meet. There's something sort of cruel to ourselves in saying that meaning is only at this cosmic level. It's slightly arbitrary. It probably is motivated by our fear of death and wanting to feel like we're immortal and that our legacy will last forever. But you can sort of drop it to some extent. You can say, well, if what I'm doing with my life, influencing a number of, making life better for a number of my contemporaries, or even just being a good parent, being a good member of My neighborhood, if I'm using a standard of meaning that is defining that as pointless, well, maybe I can just use a different standard rather than have to feel what I'm doing is meaningless. And so I think Landau would argue that the nihilist, the person who thinks like, there's no point in anything, he thinks he's being really sort of facing the hard facts of life, right? He's saying like, don't kid yourself. There's no point to any of this. But in fact, he's kind of still clinging on to a fantasy, which is that like that he should be able to, he's got very high standards for what meaning should be. And then he finds that the nihilist, then he finds that life doesn't measure up to the standard. So he's like, well, it's all pointless. But in fact, those standards, I feel like we even know that those standards don't apply. Again, we're talking before about meaningful times when you're helping a friend through a crisis or something like that. Like, there's a feeling of meaning in those times or a feeling perhaps of aliveness, some people might say, that is kind of feels self justifying. Sure, you can still point out that in any X number of thousands of years, it wouldn't have mattered that you were there for that person, but it mattered then. And Landau has this great line about we always doing this thing to ourselves where we're saying like, well, it's not a meaningful human existence because something that we couldn't Be expected to do as humans is something that we're not doing that thing. If someone loves their dog, you don't kind of correct them and tell them that actually their dog is no good because it can't drive. If someone has a really nice chair in their house, that's real pleasure to sit on, you don't say, well, no, it's a useless chair because it can't boil water for a cup of tea. We don't expect those things of those things. So fine. And can we maybe not expect of ourselves as finite humans, these kind of godlike acts of cosmic meaning, and still find that the meaning that is available to us as finite humans is actually Like really, really something serious and important and that becoming more and more wholeheartedly human is maybe a better goal in life than trying to sort of escape the human condition And become a super human.
  Speaker 2
  That makes a lot of sense. And that's the only place that I can reconcile with Oliver is, yeah, in the big picture, I'm never going to bend the arc of the universe. I have no delusion about that, but I'll matter to my kids and I'll matter to my wife and I'll matter to my friends. And that's the focus, which then brings us back full circle to the trap of productivity. Because at least for me, this is maybe, I don't know if you struggle with it in this warped way, I then say, well, gosh, I have this real sense of urgency. I'm back to now wanting to control time, because I know the statistics. Once my kids are 18, I have virtually no time left with them. They say on average, you have 19 years with your children. 18 of them occur in the first 18 years of their life one year of total time with them occurs once they go off to college. That's it. Humulative time. So I then think, oh my gosh, I have to master my time, because I have such a, it's not just the finitude of my life. It's an even greater finitude of the time I have with my kids. Now I'm doubly whipping myself to make the most of my time. And my wife and I have this discussion all the time, which is like, God, I wish I didn't have to do anything. Like, I wish I could do nothing until our kids were all gone. ([Time 0:54:51](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ffec345c-1957-4957-bd6c-7b1be6307a21))
    - **Note:** Cosmic insignificance theory vs finding meaning in our finite lives. Being a nihalist is as wrong as expecting too much from yourself and setting goals you could never reach they’re both negative. You need to balance them both. Sometimes deep meaning is just helping someone through a tough time not changing the world. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t want to change the world but that you can do that in ways big or small and you need to love and appreciate that ability in an equal and balanced way v
- Acceptance of Inherent Trade-offs in Life
  Summary:
  The conversation emphasizes the importance of recognizing and accepting the inherent trade-offs in life, particularly in balancing time between various valued domains such as work and family.
  It suggests that attempting to master time management with the expectation of maximizing capacity for everything often leads to unrealistic stress and anxiety. Instead, understanding that certain sacrifices are unavoidable can lead to wiser, more strategic decisions that prioritize meaningful experiences.
  This acceptance is framed not as a path to complete happiness, but as a poignant acknowledgment of life's limitations, fostering a different kind of emotional experience that emphasizes living meaningfully despite these constraints.
  Furthermore, the notion of seeking a unifying theory or solution to the human condition is critiqued; rather, embracing the absence of a definitive solution can be liberating and allows individuals to engage fully with the realities of life, moving away from the pressure to find a cure for existence itself.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  It's funny, the format of conversation like this is such that you say that. And then it's like, I feel like now I'm going to offer the solution, but I'm just like, yeah, I totally get it. I think that I totally feel it too. And I'm not sure that there is a solution. But I think that a lot of what we're talking about is, I think there's a shift from doing things unconsciously to doing things consciously that is really important. And that, you know, knowing and seeing that there is this trade off is in some ways the best that we can hope for, that trying to solve the problem through time mastery is not going to make Things better. Because that's going to be undertaken in the unconscious belief that there's a way of maximizing your capacity so much that you can spend all the time that feels like it matters with Your kids. And you can spend all the time that feels like it matters on the work. And it's like, if the starting point is that that isn't possible, then firstly, you make wiser decisions around the edges. Maybe you do backpedal a little bit on certain work things in order to maximize a bit more time with kids. Maybe you do organize your time in certain strategic ways to sort of make those gains around the edges and free up capacity. But more fundamentally, I feel like you can just sort of see, yeah, it's a sad truth about being who we are and being fortunate enough to have these different domains of our lives that We value, if people who are parents and people who have worked that gives them meaning or whatever other things might be competing in their lives. And so this comes back before, actually, I wanted to say in response to you talking about the person you were talking about who died and the fact that one doesn't stop feeling sad about Those things or struggling with these things, the person who thinks they're going to find a way to master their time and make enough time for everything is trapped in this kind of future Oriented anxiety. The person who sort of sees the truth about trade-offs and the truth about finitude doesn't suddenly become happy and reconciled to it all, but it's a different kind of feeling. It's a kind of poignancy, right? There's a sort of sad tinge to life that you don't get away from. But I'm sort of struggling to articulate this, but it's part of living a meaningful life is to just sort of be consciously in that fact that we don't get all the time we would wish to have. I didn't know if that made sense.
  Speaker 2
  It does. And I think going back to what we talked about earlier, I think that's why I have yet to construct this unifying theory because a unifying theory in some ways suggests a solution. It's a series of equations. Unifying theories in physics are equations. I don't think there's an equation here, even though my engineering background wants one. And there isn't. And a lot of the physiologic stuff can be broken down into equations. We can talk about cardiac output as a function of contractility and stroke volume and heart rate and systemic vascular resistance and all these things. We can really talk about physiologic stuff that way. Now, of course, at the cellular level, we're still hosed. I mean, there's a lot we can't talk about in that regard, but we still have biological mechanisms that we somewhat understand. This is much more difficult. And if people are sitting here listening to this on a podcast that's about longevity and asking, why are we talking about this? Well, I would argue if you're not talking about this, what the hell does that other stuff matter? Right. And I think you really put your finger on it with the idea that a unifying theory suggests a solution.
  Speaker 1
  It's the acceptance of the fact that there isn't a solution that is such a powerful psychological transition, I think. And it totally goes along with doing everything you possibly can to sort of maximize both the quality of your experience and the amount of time you can have the probability of having More time to have those experiences. But it steps away from this idea that one day you're going to find the solution to the human condition. There are all these great sayings and phrases and ways of putting it that come out of Zen Buddhism, where people are sort of pointing to this notion that what drives us crazy is thinking That there has to be a solution to the condition in which we find ourselves. So, quote, I use at the beginning of the book from Jocko Beck, the American Zen teacher, is she said, what makes it unbearable is your mistaken belief that it can be cured, which is quite An interestingly sort of medical way of stating the problem. A friend of mine years ago, who's a meditation person as well said, from a certain point of view, everything is palliative care. Because, you know, none of us is getting out of this alive. There are plenty of sort of mukliches, sayings that pinpoint the same problem. I don't think that's a recipe for nihilism. I think that's a recipe for letting go of a quest that wasn't possible in order to really, really get involved in the quest that is possible. ([Time 1:00:47](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8ea5718b-3590-4592-800e-b7698682c0a9))
    - **Note:** Accept that we will die and there isn’t an answer or solution to every problem there isn’t a finite end or right answer. There just is this process of life. Future oriented view leading to anxiety. We must see the truth of the sad trade offs of human life. There is no solution to life. The hard thing about maki g a decision is there is no right answer there are just 2 paths and we pick one and like to think it’s right but ultimately there is no right just ways and turns.
- The Importance of Atelic Activities and Embracing Mortality
  Summary:
  Engaging in atelic activities—those pursued for their own sake rather than for a specific goal—highlights the value of experience over instrumental use of time.
  Activities like hiking, arts, music, and dance embody the concept of enjoyment inherent to the action itself. Pursuing life strictly through a goal-oriented lens leads to a perpetual postponing of fulfillment and a disconnect from meaningful moments.
  This mindset, as illustrated by Keynes' quote, reflects a tendency to live for future experiences rather than fully engaging in the present.
  Such avoidance may stem from an unwillingness to confront mortality, prompting individuals to constantly project satisfaction into the future.
  The resulting cycle can undermine the richness of enjoyable experiences, as one often finds themselves anticipating the next event rather than appreciating the current one. Accepting the finite nature of time, rather than avoiding it, encourages a more profound engagement with life. A shift from a productivity-driven standpoint to a balanced recognition of mortality allows for a deeper appreciation of moments, even if achieving a complete acceptance of life's transience is unlikely. This perspective underscores the necessity of integrating awareness of mortality into the experience of present activities to cultivate a meaningful existence.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  The idea of an atelic activity, which is coined by a philosopher, Kieran Setia, is this the notion that of an activity that is done for itself alone, not to get somewhere, not to get something Else, that it's not the kind of thing that you will ever have done enough of. And so the example I use in the book, just because it's something I enjoy a lot, is hiking. You can't make hiking any meaningful sense more efficient because you're just, I'm sure you can walk in more efficient ways than others. But the point is simply that the reason that people are drawn to an activity like that is for the experience itself. Sure, there are some ancillary health benefits, absolutely. But you're not trying to get somewhere either in terms of training or in terms of geographically trying to get somewhere, it's just it's done for itself alone. A lot of kind of activities around arts, music, dance can be pursued in a more sort of in a way that culminates in something, but they don't have to be and a lot of the enjoyment people get Is in itself alone. And yeah, I think what Ryan means by stillness is also something that almost by definition can't be an instrumental use of time. And so I think the unifying idea here is that there is something wrong with pursuing a life in which time is considered exclusively instrumentally, so that you're always assessing The value of how you're using your time by where it's leading you and how well it's getting you to that goal. Because of course, at some point, either this has to cash out in a present moment of meaning or you're always postponing. It has the effect of sort of always postponing the moment of truth into the future. And there's a great quote that I use in the book as well from John May now Keynes, the economist, who I think gets at the point of why we do this, why we want to live for future activities, Even though it's a kind of anxious way to live, even though we're never quite at the moment of fulfillment. It's because by projecting our interests in what we're doing constantly into the future, you're sort of securing what Keynes calls a spurious immortality for them. So he's got this quote where he says, the purpose of man does not love his cat, but only the cat's kittens, nor in truth the kittens, but only the kittens kittens, and so on, forward forever To the end of captain, as he puts it. And it's kind of a terrible way to live because you never get to actually love your pet, or plug in there, whatever the other benefit or value of an activity would be. But it has this great advantage on a subconscious level that like it's all because of some way you're getting. And as long as you're still getting somewhere, then you don't have to fully kind of face the pain of the fact that like, no, this is it, that it's not a dress rehearsal, that this is the time You have to use meaningfully if you're going to have a meaningful life. I fall into this trap all the time, you know, of sort of catching myself seeing that I'm really thinking about two days time, when this stuff's out of the way, when this other stuff has Been completed, when I figured out how to do something like then I'll start living in a present way and really getting the value of life. But what we're really doing, I think I agree with Keynes about this is constantly projecting that moment forwards because it kind of feels like you don't have to die.
  Speaker 2
  Yeah, and I think it's worth saying that again, Oliver, because it's so profound. I think this is the jugular issue. I think it is this connection to our mortality and our finitude that is underpinning all of this difficulty because on the one hand, it just shouldn't be this hard. I sometimes laugh at my struggle with this, where I'll have a number of things over the next month that ostensibly all are enjoyable. Oh, I'm doing this thing with my kids on this day and we're going to go camping on this day and oh, I've got a day set aside to go racing my car on the track. I mean, these are all things that are just pure bliss to me. And when I look back at the month after the fact, I realize every time you were in one of those moments, you were thinking about the next one. It's tragic. And I think this point of am I doing that because subconsciously, I need to do that to avoid confronting the finite nature of time. I don't know if that makes sense, but that's kind of how I'm hearing and processing this.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, it makes total sense. And I think, you know, certainly in my experience, but I take solace from the fact that in, I don't think the great philosophers of history found any alternative to this, it's not that We need to aim to leave that mindset behind in favor of a kind of total, perfect reconciliation to mortality. It's just that you shift from this kind of avoidant stance, which triggers so much kind of saps the meaning from life to a stance that kind of looks it in the face and feels kind of sad about It. It's like it's not that you don't want to get tripped up on the idea that you're supposed to become, you know, totally zen about this awful human fate. You can just kind of integrate some extent, only to some extent in my case, but you can sort of integrate that poignancy into the experience. And then you do sort of land, you know, you do sort of fall back into the moment that you're in. It's tricky because I think that those of us in this kind of productivity mindset have spent a lot of time kind of beating ourselves up for not doing enough yet or not getting to a certain Point. And it's very easy to take that same stance towards the challenge of reconciling yourself to it all, right? And then feeling that you're somehow falling short because you don't feel completely zen about mortality. I don't think there's any reason to believe anyone ever does.

    - **Note:** Life for the moment do things you like for themselves don’t live in the future for some spirulus immortality. Don’t keep optimizing then you never live. Atelic activity. Don’t look at the benefits just the thing. Look the horrible inevitabilitirs in the eye and radically accept them. That’s the way forward. It’s not more optimization it’s just acceptance

  Summary:
  Engaging deeply with art or literature demands a commitment to patience, as hasty engagement diminishes the experience.
  Taking time to explore artworks reveals details overlooked initially, illustrating the discomfort of slowing down in a fast-paced world. This struggle against speed shows that genuine experiences require surrendering control over pace.
  While discomfort in adjusting to a slower tempo can be prominent, the exploration of art and meaningful reading can lead to significant rewards and deeper understanding, revealing insights that quick engagement could never afford.

  Yeah, Jennifer Roberts, she has her incoming art history students at Harvard, choose a painting or a sculpture in the area. There are many, many venues to do that in the Harvard area and then go and look at it for three hours straight. And I did this with a painting by Degas in the Harvard Art Museums. And the idea here, the motivation for her came from seeing the students who were coming into her course and feeling that their whole lives were so geared to speed, both just generally Because of the way the technological culture works, but also because of the pressures of highly competitive university, right? There's all these kinds of incentives to get stuff done as fast as you can. That it was actually her job, she felt to kind of try to influence the tempo of what they were, of what they were doing to slow them down. And she did it herself and I did it. And the really fascinating thing that you learn in this context, in the art case, I'll explain why it's relevant beyond that, but in the art cases that like, if you can sit with the intense Discomfort that is involved in looking at a painting for such an obviously absurd amount of time, right? She knows it's an outrageous length of time, that's the point. After that first sort of hour or whenever it happens for you, when the discomfort begins to fall away a bit and you really just sort of get into a different zone, you literally see things In the painting that you hadn't noticed before. And I don't mean you come up with smart, fancy sounding new interpretations of what you're seeing. I mean, like literal objects in paintings that you apparently didn't see for sort of 45 minutes of looking and looking at that painting. So the reward for kind of you're giving the experience the time that it takes, instead of trying to dictate the time that it takes, which is extremely tempting for us in all sorts of contexts. And so I'm sort of using that in the book as one example of the benefits of sort of being willing to take experiences at the speed that they need. Reading is another really classic example. You can sort of do a certain amount to read faster and to train yourself to read more efficiently, but it's very small really before you start losing the experience, especially with Kind of creative writing fiction. And I think that a lot of the time when people say that they don't have time to read or that they don't like reading anymore or so whatever, what they mean is that they really hate that it Needs them to slow down that a sort of mind conditioned to speed and to going faster has to kind of surrender to the fact that reading, especially if it's like a good novel, something is Just going to take a certain amount of time that you just have to let it take. And it's really striking how uncomfortable that feels, how deeply unpleasant it is to sort of give up control over the pace of something like that. Because like, it doesn't feel like it doesn't make any sense that it should be as painful as it is, but it is. And then I think that on the other side of that, there are huge rewards.

    - **Note:** Stopping and taking an absurd amount of time in being bored for an unreasonable amount of time. Staring at a painting for 3 hours. Don’t hurry to solutions take a step back and enjoy/ appreciate complexity. It gives you a better deeper understanding of the world
