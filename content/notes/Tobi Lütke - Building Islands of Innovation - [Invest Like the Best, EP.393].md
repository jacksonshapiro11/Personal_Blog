### Highlights

- Ignite Passion, Protect Innovation
  Summary:
  Companies often operate at a 'room temperature' equilibrium, where energy conservation leads to stagnation.
  Effective leaders, often exothermic individuals, energize their teams and challenge the status quo, introducing heat into the business. These leaders not only foster a culture of innovation but also protect their passionate individuals from the political machinations that stifle progress.
  Founders inherently possess the drive to inject energy into their organizations, demanding that teams focus on a common mission, especially more essential during chaotic times.
  Political dynamics in organizations can lead up to 60% of employees' time being wasted on political maneuvering, contrary to the best companies where it is only around 20%.
  Protecting innovative individuals requires promoting their strengths and bypassing conventional career ladders based on seniority, instead prioritizing merit. Success lies in creating an environment that celebrates speed and agility, focusing on high merit with low ego, thereby facilitating true innovation and progress. Founders and change agents must find a delicate balance between maintaining motivation and harnessing energy while not allowing political resistance to undermine their mission.

  Speaker 1
  I think what happens in most companies is they converge on, let's go with temperature. I think companies run at room temperature because that's the entropic equilibrium of temperature. That's not a problem if everyone else does it too. So in room temperature, everything is just soul. Then there's people who inject heat into businesses. Brilliant product managers, brilliant people in any job do this. They're dissatisfied with status quo. They pump energy. The best leaders are literally exothermic. They are just like this complete wellspring of heat into the system. Every atom jiggles faster around them. There's no chance for stasis. Nothing is frozen over time. However, people mean well, but they fight it. They do because everyone's allowed to try to conserve energy. Everyone's allowed to be intelligent actor in the local incentive system. And there's a lot of heat in a project. Everyone go faster, do this better. And the best way out of it is to just politic that person away, then the people will do it. At least someone will do it in a large team. And if that works, then those people are gone. And then room temperature prevails. Founders are not room temperature people by definition. The act of starting a company is you're trying to inject heat into planet Earth. You're trying to do something like fighting against entropy. You're trying to make something better or something different. So I think founders are recruited out of a set of exothermic people to begin with. Here's the thing that founders end up doing. Not just are they injecting heat from the top into the whole thing, they also protect the others. When things are going well, they make the politicking against them not work. So if you do this well, I have a company that many of my reports, I think almost all of them, are the founders of the company. I literally collect them. During COVID, I had a lot of executive turnover. I went to the founders' Slack channel, which is people who over the years brought into Shopify for talent acquisitions and so on, and said, hey, we're in a crazy time and you all have been Responsible for people's livelihoods before, and therefore you know what that's like and who can do what. Let's go. Let's dance. And I think this is a real thing. Companies have a clock speed. Companies have a temperature. And it's just powerful to preserve it. And then it's powerful to be able to use all that energy and direct it into a mission where you can re-derive from first principles what the next best step is on this mission, especially During times where the fog of war has settled and the map is not quite clear, the mission gives you a direction and you need to figure out the best path through it. In a game of perfect information, in a time of perfect information, maybe this is sort of a 2017, 18, 19 era. This is actually not ideal for companies. I think you actually want potentially lack of heat in the system, lack of jiggly atoms, pick your metaphor here, is not fatal because actually the plans will work because the plans are Not going to be invalidated by a changing environment. And therefore, it's way simpler to lead a company this way. All these stories about hire good people and get out of their way actually work, but they work accidentally because everyone's just following the plan. The plan is the thing that's telling people what to do, not the CEO.
  Speaker 2
  Especially interested because it resonates so much with my own experience. The act of protecting the exothermic hot people seems like where the rubber really meets the road here in terms of what your job is. Obviously, you got to get them in the seats in the first place. You talk about that too, but you can probably identify those people, even if it's just those that have been founders, like you said. Can you tactically tell me how you have protected those people and the steps that you've taken to not let the political machine oust them from the system and reject the organ?
  Speaker 1
  Look, the difference between the best companies in the world and the worst company of the world is probably that humans are political creatures. And the best companies in the world, people spend up to 20% of the time on politics, and then most companies is up to 60%. There's a very small margin in which you can operate. You can harness politics, too. It can be good, it can be bad. It's not even all that. But it usually means that people have a different hierarchy of goals than the company itself. So the top goal is not the mission of a company. It's your own career or something like this. How do you protect people? Well, you just make the exothermic thing work. That's what you promote. Again, I pick people from individual crafter roles and put them in charge of large hundreds of people departments after they ran a code red. For me, that just really worked. And they have the abilities to do this. But they skipped many, many rungs that other people think they should have really passed through on the ladder of a career. And I just don't agree with that. And the people that really, really need this to be all just so and everything being seniority based, I suppose. I think there's a lot of great companies out there that are structured so and I don't have a product that they want to buy in terms of a way to think of a career. I think of merit. And I'm actually not arguing in favor here of a brilliant jerk and keeping them and building because I think that's actually can end up being toxic. I think also like the ego to merit ratio has to be enormous to just bother with people, I think. Life's too short to surround yourself with mean energy vampires like that. That's not a good idea. So high merit to ego ratio is important. Some people are incredibly good at what they do, and they are allowed to be self-confident about them. I know some people misconstrue this as arrogance, but it's arrogance if you're no good at thing. If you're actually good at a thing, you're just communicating it. And people might not like that, but that's just aesthetics at this point. It's a complicated balance and you have to figure it out. The second way is malice in behavior amount. So there's a code of conduct, minimum requirements. I think that's a valuable thing to just break up in this context. So how do you protect them? Well, you do. You say, hey, we have a company built for these type of people and we celebrate going fast and it's what this place is all about.
  Speaker 2
  Can you have a team full of hot people, of exotropic people, or do you need some room temperature people no matter what?
  Speaker 1
  I don't think it's possible to try that at any kind of scale just because it's just not that common. But I think, quote, absolutely. I think that's the story of the greatest agents of change. I'm sure the founding fathers had no passive players in them o... ([Time 0:18:20](https://share.snipd.com/snip/270e5532-4a0b-431b-add1-85003823df10))

- Build Your Own Island, Invite Others
  Summary:
  Creating your own unique space—your 'island'—is essential for self-expression and fostering innovation.
  Individuals who build their islands harness the power of their distinct experiences and insights to create meaningful work, often benefiting from periods of separation to cultivate their ideas. Successful projects, like open-source initiatives and companies such as Shopify, arise when creators focus on their visions, inviting others to join based on shared value rather than conforming to external pressures.
  This approach emphasizes the importance of legitimacy and merit in product development, highlighting that effective products emerge from a genuine care for quality and community.
  Avoiding the pitfalls of commodifying customers ensures sustainable relationships, keeping the focus on long-term value rather than short-term gains.
  Ultimately, the act of building something worthwhile attracts others and creates a vibrant community around shared values and aspirations.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Who makes decisions? And we're doing something for a completely different purpose. Then again, if you can find something that is of value, other people will do it. If not, no one cares, and that's fine too. The participants of an island are getting exactly what they want.
  Speaker 2
  They don't need everyone else to also use it. I think that's important. Can I ask about maybe two dimensions of this and get your reaction to it? So one is I'm obsessed with this concept of life's work. And increasingly, I have realized that the thing that attracts me to people is those who are doing what you say, like building their own island. And everyone's got a unique experience. Well, maybe we can talk about that, like how different people's experiences are could be a problem here. But people do have unique experiences. And if they find a way to self-express into whatever it is that they do, a business, art, whatever, that's where real magic happens. And that a lot of that comes from separation. Always love that Joseph Campbell idea who studied the history of mythology and that he credits all of his findings with going into the woods for five years and reading books by himself And talking to nobody and just being separated. Being on an island. Yes. Yeah. Being on an island. So I'm curious, I want to talk about how we can promote more islands in general, all the ideas you have for doing so. My own idea would be this concept of life's work plus maybe separation, which are different ideas, but really important, can be ways of doing this. Because I think a lot of people listening will find the idea appealing and say, yeah, I want to create one of those, but not know how to do so. So I'm curious for you to riff on that.
  Speaker 1
  The two ones I now work extremely well is in the programming world, we have open source, which is always iron producing. And I think actually the purest implementation of a market, open source is totally misunderstood by the way. People always think about this as the commons produces something that's better, but literally it's the opposite. Everyone can fork the project if they have better ideas and send gifts from there. And if those gifts end up being better than the previous version, then it's a marketplace that doesn't run for money. It just runs purely for legitimacy and merit. And every good open source product is led by a very small group of people surrounded by a clear and highly legitimate leader. So it teaches us a lot about human organizational structures that work. And then companies. Look, Shopify is an island from the beginning and it's my life work. So you might be talking about my book here, but I was part of a real main continent, real world, let's call it. I looked at the software that was available to me and I just didn't want to use it. I built my own because I didn't think people were doing this right. I built it for myself. I built the software I was looking for that I didn't find. I figured, man, I'll just build that because I think other people will find that useful. And then I invited people over. The amount of times I heard, hey, this shopper thing, I like that you're doing something like this, but this will never work in the real world. It's basically every day. This will never work within the real world for real retailers. This will never work in the real world for real businesses. This will never work with customers or enterprises or any of these. I've heard it all. And here's my response every single time. It's like, yeah, that's fine. I'm not building for a real world. I'm building for my own island. And I'll invite you over. If you think what I have is better, use it. So I think that's important. This separation is important. And again, I'm going to give myself a B minus to C plus here. Because again, when we went into, I think I could have survived 10 years of a boom cycle intact, but year 11, 12, 13 of zero interest rate phenomena appended to a 10 year bust cycle. I got washed. Someone built a bridge to mainland and I didn't notice. I got infected by some ideas. I would not cross with myself about this. So my defenses weren't good enough to be permanently outside of this, but I still have some semblance of success here. And I think I've reestablished sovereignty. So again, we are not building for real world. We are building based on insights into the problems from first principles. And then if people like it, they use it. And then those trend lines we talk about, Jeff gives me the update points. I throw the trend lines between the points. And if those go in the right direction, that's really good. But it's a consequence of making sound decisions for particular problems that we as a company, me as a patient zero, and then we as a company have just fallen in love with and give a shit About. Because at the end of the day, I know this is all very abstract. I'm saying it's all probably terribly confusing. So just say something a lot more actionable, because the place you arrive at, at the end of all this philosophizing is products are good when the people who make them give a shit. And because what they do is they fill up the products with giving a shit and everyone feels it on the other side. And that's just wonderfully simplifying realization at the end of the day. And I'm sure there's hundreds of paths into navigating a new position where you can create products that give a shit. And the beautiful thing about products is they are one of these things which causes community. And community is one of those things which bootstraps separation to some degree. And that is the substrate from which true lasting differentiation can be done. And again, we're 20 now in Shopify. And so it's gratifying to have done so. I aspire to what Matt's did with 31 years of a difference in a Ruby world. And I hope to spend my entire career soon.
  Speaker 2
  So there's this island that let's just presume its existence. And then there's constantly attempts from the mainland to build bridges to it and infect it. One of the things that's so fascinating to me as you're a big public company is that Wall Street always has lots of ideas for what you should do. And one of those ideas, if you go read the expert transcript libraries, which give you a nice window into what people are asking about, is why does Shopify not go monetize its end customer More? Why has it remained so focused on the merchant? It has this massive network. Why is there not a Shopify Prime equivalent? Why aren't you figuring out some way to take this thing that you uniquely have and drive more monetization from the consumer side rather than the merchant side? This is like island and bridge to me and a tangible example to make it real for people. Walk us through that specific pressure from Wall Street.
  Speaker 1
  I don't disagree with all those things. I just think people always are made for value of an idea. An idea is worth one good bottle of scotch. Everything else is in implementation. And here's the thing, the implementation matters. For instance, it will be trivial to do this, but there's an understudied, underacknowl...

    - **Note:** Joseph Campbell needed to go into the woods for 5 years to figure out his life. We all need to do this in our lives. We all go into the woods at different times in different aspects we’re all lost travelers for some period some of us are destined to be lost forever others find ourselves again on our journey some never even leave but we are all faced with this and we never know when it comes or when we grab it.
- Empowerment Through Complexity
  Summary:
  Empowering individuals with tools that simplify complex processes enhances entrepreneurial journeys.
  By minimizing friction and confusion, technology allows more people to reach their business aspirations, fostering independence. A user-friendly interface that retains necessary complexity caters to both novice and seasoned entrepreneurs, encouraging rapid progress toward billion-dollar business potential.
  With advancements in AI, the interaction with technology will evolve toward more conversational and integrated experiences, making it easier to conduct business and shop.
  Future environments will blend digital and physical realms, enabling personalized recommendations based on user data, enhancing convenience and trust.
  This vision relies on leveraging cutting-edge software to connect users with technology's vast capabilities and ensure accessible paths to success.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Partners if that's what people need or just deeply competent logo designers if that's what you reach for or just explain how to actually set up a domain and how to incorporate business Wherever you are. People will get so much more support on their journeys that just more people can reach for it because there's a lot of white space. There's a lot of pirate-themed poker sets to be done in basically every other intersection of multiple awesome things that can be put together. And I think my most hopeful belief here about this AI age is that a lot of the products, lots of the things that don't exist, a lot of value that wasn't added to a global GDP happens because Friction, confusion, lack of access to information, and too much difference to naysayers who say reaching for independence is not the thing to do with a career. And I think that'll change over next years. And it's already changed in the last 10 years. I think that's awesome. Can you re-articulate your product philosophy? At core, my philosophy is humans are absolutely awesome. And computers are absolutely incredible networks we've built and the international network we've built. The infrastructure that humans have built is awesome. And I want to put this stuff together in such a way that you give those awesome powers to as many people as possible and then let them have a go at it. At a different Zoom level of a fractal, we follow a philosophy of make the important stuff super easy and make everything else possible. That's why you can get a store in a minute that could power your business for life. You can dive into the miniature of a template language or compile a web assembly extension for Shopify to customize it just so you can do both things. So that's important. But all of it, I think from day one, the killer feature of Shopify has been that it's retained complexity into super approachable user interface that can be used by people with minimal Training. And hopefully, in most cases, the significant power of a system only reveals itself to people in the moment that they actually have such problems. And it's very hard to build software that scales as far as we do. And we're not talking about technical scaling, that's also hard, but super fun. And I'm never worried about the stuff that's hard and fun. The stuff that's hard and not seen as significant fun is much harder to do, because that's where the exothermic energy needs to come in. You know what unfun causes? Freezing. At some point, at zero and then nothing ever happens anymore. So one thing that's unfun sometimes is this taming of complexity, which is building software that actually works for people that try to reach for independence and glory in their lunch Break. And still the same software works for multi-billion dollar businesses. Everyone's like, man, that is clearly the people up here in the market make all the money. They have money, they have sophistication, they They have dedicated staff. They have training programs. Why don't we just build for them instead of everyone? That would be much easier to do. And yeah, the answer to that is 100%. And by the way, it would be very hard for a not founder mode company, like a managerial run company, for someone to create a plan that the consensus will sign off on that says, hey, let's Build software for people in their lunch break. That can also power billion-dollar businesses. That's not a sensible thing to do, yet it's exactly the right thing to do because what is missing in this equation is, well, if you do that, you can help people become the billion-dollar Businesses fast. The billion-dollar businesses on Shopify started on Shopify now. We've been around long enough to see the other side of something that was only a hope at some point. So we can now take a very active role. If a business could be many million-dollar businesses, I think the software can just push people to get there faster than they thought was possible. And we can reduce the complexity of the entire journey. And frankly, we are going to reduce the complexity of that journey absolutely tremendously for all the AI stuff that's coming. So I think we can remove so much friction that at some point business can just grow very, very, very fast. I think that's awesome. So my life feels like build the best possible software that anyone could possibly go find for who wants to do this thing. That is what our mission is about. And then compromise to the point of currently technological possible and then build that. But know what insanely great looks like, and then compare the changing landscape of technology capabilities to what we actually really, really want. The ideal Shopify version of product is you have a quick conversation or email tell us about products that you have and want to sell. And then there's a beautiful website doing it perfectly for everyone. Maybe it's it's customized to every individual person visiting it, or is talking through AI as an advisor to other AIs to tell them why you also need pirate-themed poker sets. And then if someone orders it, we teleport it to people. That's the ideal state. This is everything working perfectly, but let's compromise because we haven't beaten physics on the teleportation. But boy, have you gotten a lot of AI now. So this is what keeps it fun. And my product principles is pull as much value out of what the smartest people in the world of computer science and logistics and computer networks have figured out to be helpful on Our entrepreneurial journey so more millions of people can do it.
  Speaker 2
  I love the product philosophy of connecting people that want to use the tools to the most magical elements of what technology enables. I'm curious in the face of AI, how you think the way we interact with computers in the first place might radically change. Someone talked to me recently about a world post applications. What if the way we interface with computers is incredibly fluid and not in separate panes, not in separate windows or applications, and that it just starts to feel more like a conversation. I'm curious if you think that will come to merchants, to the way that we shop and bigger picture, just the way we interact with machines and how you deal with that. I 100% agree that this is what's in store.
  Speaker 1
  Now, you're not moving from one thing to another. For instance, all of us technologists, especially programmers, have lived through many such changes. We are all using a paradigm of hopefully nice high DPI screen. It has windows on it. Most computer programmers will have somewhere a terminal window and that reaches into the command line. That's the old Unix. The Unix is still alive, still sits below all this stuff. And the people who know how to wield it like an intricate, incredibly powerful instrument reach through the Windows back into the Unix system. So it's there. I think a lot of what we're doing on computers is going to take a similar form. It's just like programmers reach to the Unix command line. Our generations of computer users will appreciate Windows and applications. Many of these applications might exist only on our computer because it was bespoke created by an AI for us, for our purposes. But I think it...

- Trust Builds Through Truth and Accountability
  Summary:
  Building trust within an organization requires working with trustworthy individuals and consistently demonstrating reliability.
  It's crucial to convey that not everything will succeed, yet trusting in people's abilities accelerates the development of trust. Distinguishing between conventional opinions and true correctness, grounded in first principles, fosters a culture where diversity of thought is encouraged.
  Organizations should prioritize actual truth over consensus to avoid mediocrity and political dynamics.
  Encouraging members to present their ideas, even if they challenge existing projects, contributes to a more engaged community.
  The concept of the 'trust battery' emphasizes the significance of micro-interactions, where the collective perception of correctness within the community shapes trust dynamics. Ultimately, if truth is the primary value, trust can flourish at an accelerated pace, coupled with a culture that accepts failure as part of the growth process.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  I'd love to close and collect all of these ideas together into a final question. What's really standing out in my memory from the conversation is these exothermic people, the role of heat inside of organizations, the role of hopefully getting those people on an Island somewhere to build something with variance, with uniqueness to it. These are beautiful ideas. Shopify is one of them. Maybe you had a little detour there for a couple of years in years 11 and 12 of Zerp, but you're back. So you've got one and it's big and there's a lot of people there and it serves a lot of people. How do you build trust inside an organization at this scale? Because for this to keep going, that seems like the core element that you need. And I'm curious how you do it.
  Speaker 1
  Work with people deserving of trust and repeatedly show that they come through whenever you trust them. Explain why this is non-negotiable and also explain that this is not everything has to succeed. Actually, people build more trust with me quicker than they disagree with something and are right, or at least right based on everything they know, and then articulate that. And then we can have a conversation about why this still isn't correct and what perspective they might not have missed. I love these conversations. I think you have to have a culture, but the important thing is what is your definition of right actually? Yeah. Because I've learned that a lot of people's definition of right is actually the opinion that most people hold is the right opinion. You're trying to converge on the consensus decision. I think that's deadly. I think that's a fitness function of the mainstream again. It can't be a fitness function of your island. Your fitness function of your island, I think if you're trying to be different and you're trying to be on the good side of different, aka better than mainstream, you need to make actual True correctness the thing. So I think when people are correct in a first principle sense and are willing to say so, even if it's inconvenient, what happens next is the thing that really shapes your culture. If that is appreciated, you're going to go places. If that isn't, then you're dealing with either wrong assumptions about the culture by some people or politicking. So that is very important that that doesn't work. So then it becomes a way for people to help themselves to having opinions that's distributed, because again, is it true? Is the thing that's important? And that allows people to step out of the org chart and just put up their hands saying, I've got something here and know that this is going to be going well for them, even if it contradicts Potentially what the project has been doing before. It's also lots and lots of interactions. I do have an entire thing on the trust battery. It's micro interactions too. I think the big one is what is the opinion about correctness, about truth and about right that is at the core of a particular community that you are part of. And again, if it's truth, then trust can be built across the company at a fairly high rate. And then the cost of failure has to be very, very low there.
