### Highlights

- The Electra, Clarence Kelly Johnson, and the Skunk Works Division
  Summary:
  The Electra and Casablanca brings us to the first core part of our story, which is World War II. Clarence Kelly Johnson started the famous Lockheed Skunk Works division. And listeners, you know this plane. It's one of those romantic early aircrafts that were always sort of perched up at an angle where if you saw it standing still on a runway, it looked like it could just take off at any moment.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  And listeners, you know this plane. It's one of those romantic early aircrafts that were always sort of perched up at an angle where if you saw it standing still on a runway, it looked like it could just take off at any moment.
  Speaker 1
  Oh, absolutely beautiful. The Electra and Casablanca brings us to the first core part of our story, which is World War II, which transforms everything. And a man named Clarence Kelly Johnson, who started the famous Lockheed Skunk Works division.
  Speaker 2
  And this is great because before I started the research, I was loosely aware that Lockheed had the first skunk works. Now it's become almost like Kleenex when someone says skunk works. Oh, we're going to start a little skunk works division. And like, it was not a thing until Kelly Johnson started the skunk works.
  Speaker 1
  There's a wonderful book, there are a bunch of wonderful books around Lockheed, but a book titled Skunk Works that was written by Ben Rich, who was Kelly's second in command for a long time at Skunk Works and then took it over when Kelly retired. And this book is like the top gun of historical autobiographies. You read it and you were just fired up. It is amazing what these people did.
  Speaker 2
  It's Top Gun for Engineers. ([Time 0:09:13](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8e2a5dac-2d72-43ab-adfd-35fc17a1b181))
    - **Note:** Lockheed founded the idea of skunkworks divisions. Kelly Johnson is a genius and one of the best airplane designers of all time. He helped drive Lockheed forward.
- Lockheed's P-38 Lightning Fighter in World War II
  Summary:
  The P-38 Lightning fighter was the US's elite fastest, most maneuverable aircraft during World War II. All of the top aces in the US Army Air Corps flew them. It was the plane that shot down the transport that was carrying Japanese admiral Yamamoto.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Yeah, this is a thing that was eye opening to me doing the research. Lockheed's big customer in World War II before the US enters was Britain's Royal Air Force. They were a way bigger customer than the US was for many, many years.
  Speaker 1
  So then once the US enters the war and as they're gearing up to enter the war, Kelly designs the amazing P-38 Lightning fighter, which was the US's elite fastest, most maneuverable aircraft during World War II. They made over 10,000 of them during the war. And all of the top aces in the US Army Air Corps flew them. It was the plane that shot down the transport that was carrying Japanese admiral Yamamoto, the guy who had kind of mastermind it and overseen the Pearl Harbor attack. ([Time 0:13:56](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f7527c44-c2b1-449a-8b8b-8818ff5c55a1))
    - **Note:** Lockheeds P-38 was a legendary airplane that defined ww2 as the best fighter made 10k of them.
- How Skunk Works Got Its Name and Built the First US Fighter Jet
  Key takeaways:
  - In order to build the first prototype US fighter jet named the Lulu Bell, Johnson hand-picked 23 of Lockheed's best engineers and designers, plus 30 of the best shop people, to work in a circus tent rented by Johnson next to a plastics factory near Lockheed's headquarters in Burbank, California.
  - The outdoor nature of the tent and the smell coming from the nearby plastics factory led to the team being called the Skunk Works.
  - The name Skunk Works was inspired by a popular comic strip called Little Abner, and a character in the strip with an outdoor moonshine still called the Skonk Works (with an O). Lockheed eventually changed the name to Skunk Works after being sued by the publisher of Little Abner.
  - Kelly and his team were able to build the Lulu Bell prototype in just 143 days from start to finish, an impressive accomplishment given the circumstances.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So Johnson hand-picks 23 of Lockheed's very best engineers and designers, and about 30 of the best shop people, people that actually build the airplanes, and get this, he rents a literal circus tent to house them in the parking lot next to a plastics factory that is nearby to Lockheed's headquarters in Burbank, California. And it is because of this that the name Skunk Works is born because of the outdoor nature in the tent and the smell coming from this plastics factory. At the time, there was a very popular comic strip called Little Abner, and a character in this comic strip had an outdoor moonshine still, making bootlegs, prohibition-era alcohol, and this still in the comic strip was called the Skunk Works.
  Speaker 2
  I think it was called the Skunk Works.
  Speaker 1
  That's right, the Skunk Works with an O, and eventually the publisher of Little Abner sues Lockheed over using Skunk Works so they changed it to Skunk Works. So in this circus tent in a parking lot, Kelly and this super elite team from Lockheed build the first prototype US fighter jet named the Lulu Bell in 143 days start to finish. This is just wild for years. The US had been working on this technology and they hadn't gotten it operationalized, the Germans beat them to it, and then in 143 days Kelly and Lockheed go from zero to flying prototype. Wow. Crazy. ([Time 0:18:46](https://share.snipd.com/snip/eb2eb784-606b-41f6-9bb1-df0d60572a15))
    - **Note:** Kelly build an organization in. Circus tent and they went from pre development to opprratuonal in 143 days on a fighter jet that had taken years with nothing to show. Best people working together. They did only what made their beer taste better and outsourced a lot of design because they had to. Bought engines from overseas. This was the beginning of skunk works. Won collier trophy.
- The Skunk Works Operation: How to Innovate Without Burdening Management
  Summary:
  Skunk Works is based in Burbank, California. The company was founded by Kelly and his handful of bright young designers. They brainstormed what if questions about the future needs of commercial and military aircraft. If one of their ideas resulted in a contract to build an experimental prototype, Kelly would borrow the best people he could find in the main plant to get the job done.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  It's insane. This not taking too much money thing does become a core tenant of the Skunk Works operation because you can sort of get around management's ire and management's need to report to shareholders and things like that. If you're doing amazing things and pulling rabbits out of hats and when it's not going well, you're not a huge burden. Yeah.
  Speaker 1
  So I'm going to read a little more from Skunk Works here. So Kelly and his handful of bright young designers that he selected took over some empty space in building 82. This is a building on the Lockheed campus, which is right next to the Burbank Municipal Airport. It's an unmarked building. Literally like this is a commercial airport that average people are taking off of every single day. So that it continues those guys brainstormed what if questions about the future needs of commercial and military aircraft and if one of their ideas resulted in a contract to build an experimental prototype, Kelly would borrow the best people he could find in the main plant to get the job done. That way the overhead was kept low and the financial risks to the company stayed small. His small group were all young and high spirited who thought nothing of working out of a phone booth if necessary as long as they were designing and building airplanes. ([Time 0:23:31](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2d12bfe1-4005-45fc-b4bb-8b2b9cae8a8a))
    - **Note:** Kelly got skunk works approved as a side project while head of engineering. He wanted people prominently in the action and at the forefront of it. Pieces of the action. Kept designers very close to production. Key insight. Keep a very small full stack team smaller than you even thought it needs to be. Small number good people. See Kelly’s 14 rules. 10-15% of size and have them work together.

So to get both of those, remember, click the link in the show notes, go to vanta.com slash acquired, and our thanks to Vanta. All right, David. So what makes Skunk Works work?
  Speaker 1
  Well, to start, all that mattered. Literally the only thing that matters is rapid delivery of superior products. And that was driven by the expedient requirements of World War II, literally saving America in the free world, and then the Cold War, which is going to come in in a big way in a second here. Listeners might be thinking, isn't all that matters in any business, rapid delivery of superior products? ([Time 0:27:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/49697c1a-a65d-4d05-81cb-e54635653a9e))
    - **Note:** All that mattered was rapid delivery of superior products. This is never the case because of politics. Need a manager with complete control and autonomy. No middle manager. Most raises come from managing more people but you should really give raises for less they are more efficient. That’s how Kelly thought. Most from the least. Need a highly motivated group which was a given. America wasn’t complacent at this time.
- The Policy of Deterrence and the Fear of Nuclear War in America
  Summary:
  In 1955, there was a national poll that asked the question, what do you think you are most likely to die from? And over half of America responded that they thought they were most likely to died in thermonuclear war. Over half of the country thought they were going to die in nuclear war. Horrifying. In a war of perception, intelligence is paramount. It is the most important thing. Even more important than your ability to strike and wage war is your ability to know what the current state of the opponents ability is to strike and Wage War. So that means that the battleground is no longer the use of weapons, but the intelligence about the existence and positioning of weapons.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  This really was the policy of the military and the American government that we need to have capabilities to deter the Soviet Union from launching a first nuclear strike against us by being able to guarantee and have them know that we guarantee that if they do so, we will destroy them. So they can't do this because if they do, they will be destroyed. That was the whole policy. And that's like a really scary place to be. This is like, if somebody over there in the Kremlin decides one day that they think they can win, we're all going to die. Right. In 1955, there was a national poll that asked the question, what do you think you are most likely to die from? And over half of America responded that they thought they were most likely to die in thermonuclear war, above any other cause. Let that sink in. Over half of the country thought they were going to die in nuclear war. Horrifying.
  Speaker 2
  And so in a war of perception, intelligence is paramount. Bingo.
  Speaker 1
  It is the most important thing. Even more important than your ability to strike and wage war is your ability to know what the current state of the opponents ability is to strike and wage war. So that means that the battleground is no longer the use of weapons, but the intelligence about the existence and positioning of weapons. ([Time 0:35:21](https://share.snipd.com/snip/142e22cc-22a2-4b40-91c3-527d60d893a2))
    - **Note:** The Cold War was a very scary time and deference and intelligence became vital to the plan. The CIA wants a spy plane and it needs fly at 70k feet almost twice as high as any other plane which was basically space where jet fuel didn’t work and humans couldn’t survive at that height so they invented a space suit. It took them 3.5mm and 1 year. Astounding quality. They partnered with Edwin lande on the U2 camera. Synergies. Skunk works needed a top secret place to test these planes and so they invented Area 51. The soviets track the flight but it’s too high ti shoot down and in this war of perception the Soviet’s can’t admit they’re tracking us nor that they can’t shoot us down so the flights continue.
- The Early Days of Computing in Silicon Valley - A Look into the History of Lockheed and Fairchild Semiconductor
  Summary:
  In 1955, Shockley semiconductor co-invented the transistor. Lockheed was coming to Silicon Valley at the same time. Computing basically wasn't a thing yet. So like they've got Terman's radio background, but there really weren't any people with compute experience yet.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, they had this huge structure called the blue cube that has since been disassembled. It's not there anymore. But you need a big hangar that you're going to build missiles in and they end up building a lot more than missiles we're going to talk about.
  Speaker 2
  And you mentioned they need radio and they need computing. Computing basically wasn't a thing yet. I mean, Shockley co-invented the transistor just a few years before started Shockley semiconductor in 1955. The same time as Lockheed is coming to Silicon Valley.
  Speaker 1
  Right.
  Speaker 2
  And of course Shockley is a predecessor to Fairchild semiconductor, which is a predecessor to Intel. So like they've got Terman's radio background, but there really weren't any people with compute experience yet. That was all happening concurrently all around them in Sunnyvale and Palo Alto.
  Speaker 1
  So we talked about this a bunch actually on the first Sequoia capital episode when we were telling Don Valentine's story. And at the time when we were telling the story, we're like, oh, you know, Don, he was so legendary before he started Sequoia. He was the head of sales at Fairchild semiconductor and the head of sales at National semiconductor. And we sort of glossed over to we were like, yeah, you know, he was mostly selling to defense companies. Well, who do you think he was selling to?
  Speaker 2
  I mean, he was selling to defense company.
  Speaker 4
  Yes.
  Speaker 1
  Now he was also selling around the country to other defense contractors too. Lockheed wasn't the only company that was working on missiles. ([Time 1:13:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4ee9a5c8-fbd3-4b1c-a1c2-91b3cd3c8627))
    - **Note:** Lockheed almost founded Silicon Valley and they were a massive buyer of missiles because they needed to compute to guide the missles. Lockheed employed 10x more people than hp. Thurmond founded the valley because he wanted to create an open ecosystem for innovation and company building for defense purposes which founded the open nature/ethos of the valley.
- Lockheed & Silicon Valley's Role in the Polaris Missile Project
  Summary:
  Firing ICBMs from the deck of a surfaced ship be at a submarine or otherwise, bad idea, basically impossible. But firing missiles from under the ocean was doable and Lockheed did it with the help of Silicon Valley. In December 1955, the Navy awards this contract to Lockheed. The name of the project was Polaris. People might have heard of Polaris missiles. Just over four years later, after the contract is awarded in 1960, the very first US nuclear ballistic missile equipped submarine set sail on its patrol.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Okay, so back to the sea. It turned out like we were talking about a minute ago that firing ICBMs from the deck of a surfaced ship be at a submarine or otherwise, bad idea, basically impossible. But firing missiles from under the ocean was doable. And Lockheed did it with the help of Silicon Valley. So in December 1955, the Navy awards this contract to Lockheed. The name of the project was Polaris. People might have heard of Polaris missiles. Just over four years later, after the contract is awarded in 1960, the very first US nuclear ballistic missile equipped submarine, set sail on its patrol, and everything we just talked about is operationalized, equipped with Lockheed Polaris A1 under sea fired nuclear warheads, ballistic missiles could reach land-based targets up to 1200 nautical miles away from wherever the submarine was when it launched it. And it was all built out of Silicon Valley with many subcontractors all over the place. Right.
  Speaker 2
  I'm assuming Lockheed doesn't actually make the nuclear warheads, right? Like that was still happening in national labs at Sandia and all the places that were pioneered during World War II.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, Lockheed did not make the submarines, nor did they make the nuclear warheads. ([Time 1:22:42](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3fde9ba8-9c46-439c-aaf0-d121c6b522c3))
    - **Note:** Lockheed took up 2 missions one was to launch missles from underwater the other was space. They became integral in these 2 races which were considered mission critical for establishing superiority of force. These underwater icbms became a huge deterrent that the us wanted to show off.
- Burlap Cities and Suburban Cover: How Disney and Lockheed Built Spy Plane Disguises
  Summary:
  Boeing and Lockheed built burlap cities on top of factories that looked like suburbs. Disney Imagineering was involved in creating these sets for Disneyland. If bombers ever made it to the West Coast, that they wouldn't know where to bomb.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Maybe it's all the cover, maybe all the money that went into Silicon Valley. No, I don't think that was the case. Either way, you don't want to find out.
  Speaker 2
  Speaking of cover, do you know about the things we did on top of the factories when we were building airplanes?
  Speaker 4
  Oh, yes, and Disney was involved.
  Speaker 2
  Yeah, starting way back in World War II, but I think continuing after that, in the Burbank facilities at Lockheed, I know Boeing in the Seattle area and other places too, built basically these burlap cities on top of factories that looked like suburbs, complete with 3D cars and trees and stuff, so that anybody who was creating a spy plane and flying overhead would mistake our manufacturing facilities for something innocuous.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, I think it was spy planes and also during World War II bombers. If bombers ever made it to the West Coast, that they wouldn't know where to bomb. I'm pretty sure that Disney Imagineering was involved in creating these sets like they made for Disneyland.
  Speaker 2
  It's crazy how sometimes it's in our best interest to make the adversary aware of our capabilities, and sometimes we want disguised capabilities. It's really interesting. Super interesting.
  Speaker 1
  Okay, so if you remember back when we pressed pause on the Skunk Orange story and moved up the state of California, up the coast to Silicon Valley, we'd said that when Gary ([Time 1:27:13](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6ca0db74-f4cd-443d-9618-036f046e077d))
    - **Note:** The us created fake cities to cover the airplane manufacturing locations so it could be hidden from the enemy likewise they were open about displays of force through showing ICBM’s. When should you show force vs hide your hand.
- The Top Secret Corona Program's Incredible Discoveries in Space
  Summary:
  LMSC returned 39,000 man-made objects from space. They took 2.1 million feet of film of photographs in 39,000 cans. If this weren't a top secret black classified program for what three and a half decades, we would be all over the history books.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  By the way, they returned 39,000 man-made objects from space. They took 2.1 million feet of film of photographs in 39,000 cans.
  Speaker 1
  I mean, any one of those things that I just mentioned, if this weren't a top secret black classified program for what three and a half decades, we would be all over the history books. And as is like nobody knows about this stuff.
  Speaker 2
  Yeah, it's the first, obviously, mapping of Earth from space. It's this first stereo-optical data from space. It's the first reconnaissance program to fly 100 missions at all, let alone one in space. I mean, this thing operated for 12 years. Yeah, crazy.
  Speaker 1
  So, Corona would then lead to three follow-up programs that we know of. I'm sure many, many more. But there are three follow-on ones that LMSC did that have been declassified so far. Some of these only very recently. So, the strategy of the program evolution over time followed the four stages that we know of. First, it was what they called see it. That was Corona. Just period, can we see the Soviet Union from space? Corona proved that. The next phase was, can we see it well? ([Time 1:39:28](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a96322d6-35fa-44ec-b9bb-72ecd21c9551))
    - **Note:** The corona program was concurrent with the public space program but was declassified only recently. It sent satalites into space that produced very high fidelity images of the Soviet Union then would drop a film canister that would be retrieved by C-130s with gloves on them. If they weren’t retrieved they destroyed themselves in 2 days. They transmitted very sensitive film from orbit and needed a special jet powered capsule to get it into low earth orbit so it could descend. This was key to winning the info game afyer the U2 program ended. It went unknown for many years. Then they launch gambit which increases visibility from 5 to 2 feet. This is still classified and the kenan which creates real time image feeds was launched and is still mostly classified.
- LMSC's Focus on Technology for Missiles and Rockets Yield Better Margins than Airplane Building
  Summary:
  LMSC accounts for over a third of Lockheed's revenue and 128% of the profit. This is much more technology problems and computing problems that LMSC is tackling here. And as we talk about all the time on this show, like, well, that's really good margins, definitely better margins than building airplanes.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And if you think about it, I guess one, just what they're developing and the scale of it and these contracts are huge, both under the ocean and up in space. Two, though, what they're doing, it's different than building airplanes. And I alluded to this when I was talking about it's a different talent set. This is much more technology problems and computing problems that LMSC is tackling here. Yes, they're building missiles. Yes, they're building rockets and all that. But the core value components of those rockets is computing and silicon and ultimately software. And as we talk about all the time on this show, like, well, that's really good margins, definitely better margins than building airplanes. So the stats I have, this is from Beyond the Horizons, which also is where a lot of the story, especially if Corona came from, during the 12 year period from 1960 when Corona first launched to 1972. Lockheed as a whole did 26 billion in revenue over that 12 year period and just 255 million in total profit, not a high margin company during that period. LMSC accounted for over a third of that revenue and 128% of the profit. So that's what I was talking about. Everything else in Lockheed lost money, or at least in aggregate, lost money. And then during the early post-Cold War period from 1983 to 1992, LMSC ([Time 1:50:25](https://share.snipd.com/snip/aa29df97-e050-4199-860c-3059cda57ff4))
    - **Note:** LMSC was the software business in Lockheed which was 33% of revenue at 128% of profits. Benefits of a high margin software business line within a business. This area of the business kept the company alive during these times.
- The Navigation Challenges of Flying at 84,000 Feet
  Summary:
  It flies at 84,000 feet. Straight basically looks black to you. Coast to Coast in an hour. And these aren't rocket engines. These are jet engines that they figured out how to make Go Mach 3. It is like 50 concurrent miracles that went into making this thing possible.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  For being placed in the National Air and Space Museum?
  Speaker 2
  Yep. Coast to Coast in an hour.
  Speaker 4
  Wow.
  Speaker 1
  And I remember being a kid and looking at this thing, like, well, why didn't we commercial then? You can't commercialize this thing. You've got to be in a spacesuit to fly this. Totally. It flies at 84,000 feet. Up looks black to you.
  Speaker 2
  Straight basically looks black to you. You can see the curvature of the Earth. You can't navigate really by Earth-based landmarks because the Earth-based landmarks are moving by you too fast. So the best you can do is be like, the Rockies are in front of me. Oh, the Rockies are behind me. And that's not terribly useful. So they had to invent a new navigational guidance system that sits on the top of the plain R2-D2 style, looking like an astromech from Star Wars, to navigate by the stars. So great. I mean, it is like 50 concurrent miracles that went into making this thing possible.
  Speaker 1
  And hopefully this is obvious, but just to make the point again, some of you might be sitting there being like, well, you just told me about how the sister company LMSC did all this amazing stuff in space. You go a lot faster than that to get to space and whatnot. And like, yeah, but you don't have humans on there. So a pilot's got to fly this thing.
  Speaker 2
  And these aren't rocket engines. These are jet engines that they figured out how to make Go Mach 3. Yep.
  Speaker 1
  Okay. ([Time 1:58:15](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4410f8cc-8aff-442b-8220-f030f012522a))
    - **Note:** SR-71 went literally faster than a speeding bullet it’s turn radius was so wide it couldn’t turn around in the stage of Ohio. The goal was to outrun the missles by going so fast and then they needed to put a human in this which made it even harder and develop a great camera so it was actually useful. This is the fastest plane ever made with jet engines ie not a rocket. They needed titanium because other metals couldn’t bear the speed of the plane and heat 500 degrees on the body 1k on the engine. They set up a shell corp to buy titanium from the soviets because they didn’t have enough in the us. The metal expanded in the sky so on the ground there are gaps in the body and the oil will just leak from the body so they invented a non flammable fuel to go in the blackbird. Cost 300mm a year to maintain. The name was changed to the RS-71 because Lyndon Johnson announced it backwards in a speech so they went back and changed all the documentation. Never been hit by a missile but 4K missles have been shot at it. This was built closer to the Wright brothers than today with mostly slide rules and minimal computers.
- Lockheed's Dark Times and Last Hurrah with Skunkworks
  Summary:
  The C5 Galaxy transport plane and other projects go horribly. The American public starts to view Lockheed as this corrupt vampire octopus military industrial complex squid sucking on America. Its finances at the same time are so bad they need a bailout from the government.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Sega actually makes an arcade game about it called I'm sorry about the Prime Minister at the time. Like so funny. Lockheed also on the military side, kind of the main Lockheed divisions engage with a couple helicopter projects with the military and then the C5 Galaxy transport plane. Those projects go horribly. They have huge cost overruns. The C5 at least I think does ultimately become a good airplane, but costs way more than the initial bidding. All of this conspires that especially post Vietnam period, the American public starts to view Lockheed as this corrupt vampire octopus military industrial complex squid sucking on America. Things get real bad. Its finances at the same time are so bad they need a bailout from the government. So the government has to guarantee a $250 million loan to Lockheed to keep them afloat. Mostly because of the L-1011 disaster. It requires a vote of Congress to do this. It almost doesn't pass. This is real bad. Hmm.
  Speaker 2
  I didn't realize how dark it got there.
  Speaker 1
  It got real, real dark. And again, it was only the profits from LMSC that kept the company from probably going under. So, okay, we've mentioned stealth a few times here.
  Speaker 2
  Back to Skunkworx. There is one more great Skunkworx airplane and it is under the administration of Ben Rich, Kelly's successor. One last hurrah, at least for the traditional Skunkworx organization. ([Time 2:19:44](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6a76eba7-3c0c-4491-a838-edf95d911e75))
    - **Note:** Lockheed fell on hard times and almost went bankrupt due to underperforming and under delivering. Tighter margins needed government bail out.
- Taking a Risk: The Story of Ben Rich and the Pursuit of Stealth Technology
  Summary:
  Ben Rich decides that he wants to put his career on the line. The Air Force says, well, you know, your timing is good. We actually also think stealth technology is worth pursuing. He goes back to Lockheed corporate and says, I want to pursue this and make a prototype anyway. Without a research contract, we're going to fund this internally,. This is not something that defense contractors do.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  So Ben Rich decides that he wants to put his career on the line.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, and take a risk and make this. So he goes to the Air Force. The Air Force says, well, you know, on the one hand, your timing is good. We actually also think stealth technology is worth pursuing. We have an active RFP out there. We didn't come to you guys because skunkworks hasn't made a fighter plane in God knows how long you guys just had layoffs. We don't like the blackbird. Sorry, you guys are old news. And then Rich, like you said, he risked his career six months into the job pursuing it at all. He risks it even further. He goes back to Lockheed corporate and says, I want to pursue this and make a prototype anyway, without a research contract, we're going to fund this internally, which this is not something that defense contractors do.
  Speaker 2
  No, we'll talk about this as we get into playbook, but it's not like a tech company where you do a bunch of forward looking R&D and then amortize it over a bunch of customers later. You go bid on a contract, you get that contract, and then you build the thing. It's so funny.
  Speaker 1
  You know, reading less so in the early history, but when you read about Lockheed today and the industry today, there's all this talk of the customer. ([Time 2:25:34](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ee9f84c9-e7a9-44da-b419-521927b3bf18))
    - **Note:** Skunkworx decides to take a big shot Ben rich was seen as a caretaker post Kelly but literally bet his career on stealth technology. This was very controversial and skunkworks was seen as an idea in name but considered basically washed up. Ben rich came in and decided to basically bet his job to do something different. The nighthawk is deadly flying 1% of missions but doing 40% of the damage. This thing was insane. This was a shoot the moon shot that was massive to set the future of Lockheed. After desert storm it’s clear Cold War is over and Washington tells defense companies to consolidate so they do.
- The Connection Between Video Games and Stealth Fighter Jets
  Summary:
  Sega co-developed the Model 3 arcade board with Lockheed Martin. It was part of the real 3D revolution in video games. They used it in the arcade cabinets, right? The cutting edge, better than home consoles, computers. Virtua Racer, Virtua Cop, Virtua Fighter being the big one.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So the stealth fighter, the Nighthawk, was angular and looked like a super Nintendo Star Fox plane because the computational ability to model it at the time, it wasn't that you needed to have just flat surfaces. It's that you could have three-dimensional rounded looking surfaces. You just needed to be able to model it for the radar signature. And computers weren't advanced enough at the time to be able to build a 3D-modeled version of a radar stealth structure. As they advanced, you are now able to do that in much the same way that in video games, you can now build life-like looking 3D models out of the same polygons before. And so the Sega, I think it was the Model 3 arcade board that we talked about that was part of the real 3D revolution in video games.
  Speaker 2
  They used it in the arcade cabinets, right? The cutting edge, better than home consoles, computers. Yeah.
  Speaker 1
  Virtua Racer, Virtua Cop, Virtua Fighter being the big one. We're on that. Sega co-developed those boards with Lockheed Martin.
  Speaker 2
  In order to model the stealth airplanes. Yes. Unbelievable. That is insane.
  Speaker 1
  So fun.
  Speaker 2
  So what we can see here is sort of the classic modern boondag, that's probably the wrong word, but program gone awry where there's a sensible total program cost for making a lot of airplanes. ([Time 2:50:22](https://share.snipd.com/snip/964342ce-57ba-405a-a9bc-2d6e4e8482cb))
    - **Note:** Sega And Lockheed work together to create 3-D graphics so like you can model stealth airplanes and Sega could use them in video games. The issue with a lot of the post consolidation projects is cost went above what was wanted and they deliver less than they promised
- The Need for Security and Competition's Impact on Human Behavior: Insights from a Podcast Episode on Lockheed
  Summary:
  There is a disconnect between people who enjoy the way of life that we have but are unwilling to acknowledge why we have it. The need for security in the world is set by the person who's most willing to come take your stuff, he says. Technology and society was pushed forward in America by the Cold War - Lockheed as part of that. "Silicon Valley itself wouldn't have existed without this"
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  So, really, there's some set of people who want to like come and take your stuff. And in the same way that price is set in a market by the person who is willing to pay the most, the need for security in the world is set by the person who's most willing to come take your stuff. And that's how much defense you need to have in order to stop them from coming and taking your stuff. And hopefully, you don't need to get into armed conflict over it. So, I do generally feel that there is a disconnect between people who enjoy the way of life that we have but are unwilling to acknowledge why we have it. And I think that is extremely different today than it was 60 years ago.
  Speaker 1
  Yes, I totally agree with everything you're saying. I also think there's another layer to this, which is really a huge theme of this journey with the research and doing this episode for me with Lockheed. And that is the phenomenon of competition and its impact on human behavior, probably for both the Soviet Union and the US, although I'm less equipped to talk about the Soviet Union. The fact of that competition led to tremendous advances for society. I mean, all the things we just talked about, Silicon Valley itself for God's sakes wouldn't have existed without this. So there is sort of a rational argument for having an adversary. Technology and society was pushed forward in America by the Cold War and by Lockheed as part of that.
  Speaker 4
  Yeah. ([Time 3:08:04](https://share.snipd.com/snip/24ec5070-06b4-4633-8d43-b88f326094bd))

- Achieving the Impossible: Lessons from Lockheed's Skunk Works and LMSC
  Summary:
  The military industrial complex has now become the opposite of that. Kelly's 14 laws and LMSC's seven tenants are a pretty damn good way to do it, he says. If you really need to or want to achieve something great bordering on impossible in a tight bordering on unreasonable time frame, these things can be very helpful.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Well I can't think of a better place to talk about. And what I think are really like the takeaways for me at least, and I hope for many people listening of this episode. And it's really like the heyday, glory days, whatever you want to call it, of Lockheed, both with skunk works and LMSC, of how these small skunk works type organizations achieved unbelievable, unfathomable things with a small number of people in an unrealistically tight time frame with very constrained resources. And that mindset is certainly not the only way that you can achieve great things, but it's a really damn good way to do it. And that mindset got injected into Silicon Valley by these people, by the military and by Lockheed. And it's just so funny that the military industrial complex has now become the opposite of that, has become like what you're talking about with NASA. Again, there's many ways to succeed in different situations, call for different things. But like, if you really need to or want to achieve something great bordering on impossible in a tight bordering on unreasonable time frame, Kelly's 14 laws and LMSC's seven tenants are a pretty damn good way to do it.
  Speaker 2
  That's so true. Otherwise you get to this thing that Norm Augustine said, how unbelievably expensive these things get if you ([Time 3:27:19](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3e8a017f-9dae-4d76-83f8-d1ccf198fa4a))
