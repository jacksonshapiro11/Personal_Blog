### Highlights

- **US Aid Corruption and Public Perception**
  - US aid is perceived as highly corrupt, with funds often misused for covert operations rather than their intended purpose.
  - This corruption fuels public anger and distrust, especially on social media, where examples of misspent funds are highlighted.
  - The public is generally accepting of LGBTQ+ rights but reacts negatively to perceived forced social changes, like those related to transgender issues and immigration.
  - This resentment stems from a sense of these changes being imposed rather than organically adopted.
  - This contrast is evident in public discourse, where acceptance of gay rights is high, while anger towards transgender issues and immigration remains prominent.

  America interventionist they could still use it as a cia asset just who runs this like it's a separate entity and it's not like who influences it i mean elon looked at it and he was like
  Arman Assadi
  He was like he was basically like this is beyond saving it's so corrupt everything is so fucked that we have to like blow the whole thing up i believe that it's super corrupt i believe that Most of what the u.s does is for sure the problem with this is like you go on twitter and there'll be like a doctor in like africa would be like cutting this is such a travesty because you Are preventing aids in this province of like kenya or something and it's just like yeah that's probably true but like what fraction of the money went to like preventing malaria in africa Versus like how much did you spend during like weird covert ops to like topple governments that like we don't know about this is what bukele is saying 10 percent might reach people that
  Nick Urbani
  Are doing good stuff but that just sounds like a very corrupt non-profit yeah yeah i mean we we were on our flight to uh to kenya when we went to um mount kilimanjaro and you remember we slept That whole flight right we slept most of it but i got up towards the end and i talked to my neighbor and i was like oh american dude kind of like a middle-aged white guy looks like he handled Himself had like a military style shoes on whatever like kind of a um everyday carry type of guy and i was like uh oh what are you going to kenny for he's like oh i'm part of usa id and i was like Oh did you did you do you um work with the cia a lot and his eyes just went like what the fuck and i was like what and he was like well we we we interface with them through the embassy like we you Know we we talked to them talked to the wrong random just woke up and i was like oh this is interesting discussion but um but yeah i mean like some of the programs are so weird in there you're
  Arman Assadi
  Like transgender studies for women in oh dude some of the stuff they're quoting was like ridiculous they're like we spent 48 000 to fund a transgender opera in ire like $52,000 to like Fund a transgender comic book in Peru and they're just like like all these like weird line items but please tax me the world is changing tax me more on such a crazy level it's not even funny
  Eric Johanson
  Did you guys see there was a Trump clip that was going pretty viral of him being funny there was an afghan lady that asked a question and he was like did you guys see that so there's this lady I don't know if she was a reporter i don't know if she was civilian and she asked a question and he's like where are you from and she's like afghanistan he's like oh beautiful beautiful Culture beautiful language um unfortunately i didn't understand a single thing you just said and all i have to say is uh because her question he understood exactly what she said because She's like what are you going to do about the situation in afghanistan how are you going to do you have a thick accent or something it wasn't that okay no it was very intentional it was funny But it was rude it was rude and it was intentional because he was just like you don't sound american i don't understand you it was like that very typical kind of like rude shit um but that's Not the bad part the part that was interesting was he was just like good luck and peace be with you like we're done like we're done yeah you're on your own and it was so interesting like it's Just exactly what's what's happening he like he looks at that as like we fucked up there it was the word you know he always says the worst withdrawal ever most embarrassing day in american History when we left afghanistan all that aside he's basically saying like now that we're gone like good luck like literally yeah um that can be concerning right that can be concerning That can be concerning for other countries america is looking at that from a perspective of leverage like we're gonna be okay and we're gonna make sure we're okay back to my earlier point By being proactive about all the areas that we might be vulnerable to make sure that if somebody does have leverage on us in a certain vertical or in a certain area we take care of that now
  Arman Assadi
  That i think that's the agenda like i i think that's really what it's down to i'm kind of cool with this general like semi-isolationist thing where it's like yeah i don't think most people In america want to be spending money to kill people here or there and all that and i think that's fine the thing that has given me like the most ick about the administration like so far has Been like the like have you seen like the recent like gaza stuff that's what i was gonna ask bro like we're gonna be isolation it's like it's kind of fucked up like what was it where i saw Today dude he's like he's basically like oh you should all like leave and go somewhere else and then we'll like develop it i was like oh my god like it's not it's not in the middle of a hostage
  Nick Urbani
  Transfer.
  Arman Assadi
  Bro, it was like. You want to throw a hostage transfer, you know? I was like, this is not good.
  Eric Johanson
  Yeah, I mean, part of the cost of, like, getting a lot of shit done is you're going to create a lot of new messes.
  Nick Urbani
  That one's a big one.
  Arman Assadi
  That one is, like, doesn't fit into the whole puzzle piece for me. Nobody needed that one.
  Stephen Cesaro
  The isolationist narrative is completely broken with that piece. Yeah, for sure.
  Nick Urbani
  I'm like, why do we... Are you going to 1031 it into Panama Canal? I saw someone said 1031 Gaza into Greenland on Twitter. Oh my god. Yeah, that one doesn't fit.
  Eric Johanson
  I've definitely also noticed an increase in racism on X. Big time. I think part of the thing with, like, get the illegals out is, like, it starts to make people, you know, a little, like, fuck off, man. Like, you're not from here. Are you? Are you first generation? Are you an illegal migrant? Are you legal? Like, it just starts to make everybody like really fucking aggressive and i think that's a huge concern of the left has always been and that's very real um i think that also exists with Like just saying like there's no trans people anymore like what what do you mean like okay hold on a second hold on a second like okay you want to remove he the they from signatures okay All right i understand no problem maybe we've been a little too far but that doesn't mean there's no trans people that doesn't mean that gay people shouldn't be respected anymore like Let's calm the fuck down because part of this is like, if you get a little too hot in the seat, people, very dumb people, will take it a lot further than you do. That's the concern I have. This was the whole January 6th thing, which by the way, I don't want to open the door on January 6th. If you say one thing, your supporters that don't ([TimeÂ 1:09:08](https://share.snipd.com/snip/55631b2e-7961-4473-8fc1-492ebc41580b))
