    - **Note:** Balancing confidence and belief in one's own ideas, not following the masses, with the humility, fear, and flexibility to understand the limits of one's own thinking. Being able to apply own ideas with confidence takes time, consistent practice on a small scale so that it can be confidently executed on a large scale when the opportunity arises. All have high levels of risk control, always looking to get out when the market no longer agrees with them. Every trader interviewed failed time and time again throughout their career, especially in the beginning, learning from those failures and applying them to the future is what sets someone apart.
