  Outbound. Okay. So I just, I know this sounds basic, but I want to slow it down for a minute. In 2023, highly personalized outbound to the right buyers always generates conversations. It always works, not to read this, but mediocre outbound and trite cadences often get you narrow. So what do I mean here? Let me slow it down in terms of things that always work. I talk to a lot of founders that tell me outbound doesn't work for them. Okay, and here's my one challenge to that. If that's you or hear it, if outbound doesn't work for you, you didn't do it right. You simply did not do it right. Take your top 10 biggest customers, top 10 most engaged customers, top 10 customers getting the most value. I'm truly getting the most value from you that love you. Find 30 other prospects exactly like them. Like the every customer has a clone, right? Every every, every, at now has a signal every they're all, they're all clones. And literally figure out who is the buyer, which is going to take time and write them the most personalized email. Right. Hey, did you know, you know, dear United healthcare at now uses us here dear Facebook Google uses us here show exactly how they use it. Where they get value from you, why they picked you and why it works. And if you get to the right person, you're probably at least going to get, get an email back that we don't need it. And you should get a double digit connect rate. You should get more than 10% of folks responding to incredibly personalized outbound to the right buyers to folks that are clones of your happy customers. You should get it. You may not know there are these numbers folks that are about 10% of customers are in market at any given time 15% 5% sure they're not all going to buy. But goodness gracious, this I've never seen highly targeted outbound to customers just like the customers you have not worked. I've never not seen it get 10% or more of folks on the phone when it's done right. But when you hire some outsourced firm or agency to like dump a lot of cloned content and destroy your list with 50,000 emails an hour. I mean, I know that works once in a while, but I don't see a work for a lot of startups. I don't see trite cadences and half hearted outbound with no research work. So prove it yourself. If you think outbound doesn't work, I'm going to argue it's because you haven't tried hard enough. You haven't slowed it down, done the research, done your homework and found instead of trying to target 3000 folks randomly who already buy another product, you haven't slowed it down and found the 30 or 300 or even three that could truly benefit your from your customer and that you literally are just like your existing customer. You already have a case study. You already have a proof point. You already have the ROI. It's not a game. And you know yourself when you get inbound pitches or outbound pitches, you know they're all terrible. You know no one does this. No one does the work. And when someone does the work, it's just amazing. And if anyone's got a couple great stories about how this works, but I can just tell you, you know, when I started my startups, this is, I didn't even know how to do outbound, but this always worked. I mean, the very first startup, I got a $10 million, $6 million a year customer by literally telling a story to the head of product of why their number one competitor used us. I got an email back that day, right? It eventually got bounced up to the CEO and all around because their number one competitor was using our product in a highly differentiated fashion. I got the meeting. It took like 10 months to close the deal eventually, but I literally got the meeting the next day. Because it mattered because hey, your number one competitor is using our product. It's disruptive in the industry. I think I could really help you. Can I show you why I'm not trying to like, break up with you or ask for a coffee meeting, or see if I could pick your brain about the industry. No, this was so targeted. Your top competitor is using us. It's working great. I didn't share anything confidential. ([Time 0:01:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a276ff10-e503-4828-840f-4d538aabe0c9))
    - **Note:** Outbound sales works but it can’t be a bullshit pitch you need to show you understand them and their problem and care. Very personalized. Not generic to 50k people specific with problems being solved. No one does the work so when someone does it’s amazing.
