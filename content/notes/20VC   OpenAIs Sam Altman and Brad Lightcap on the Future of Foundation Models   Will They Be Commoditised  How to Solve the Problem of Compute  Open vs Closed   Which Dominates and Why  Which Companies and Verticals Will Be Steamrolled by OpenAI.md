  If we flip the tables, what would you say is sounds biggest strength that not many people consider or deny?
  Speaker 3
  Some people know this, but I think... You can say none, that's fine. I'll say two things. They're interrelated. One is, I think at any given point in a company's life, there's only like one to three things that really matter at that point. Those things change, but there's almost never 10 things that really matter. And I think Sam has an incredible ability to be laser focused on those one to three things. And that spills over into how we run the team. Because if I know what he's focused on, and we may disagree on what those things are, oftentimes I think we agree, but if we can at least align on what those things are, and they may not be The right global bets, but they are the ones that feel the right at the time, then it helps me to translate down to the teams that I'm building on whether it's to... That we wanna be more enterprise focused, or it's that we want to really actually change the bet we're making on research, or we actually wanna bet more on one thing versus another, or We really need to get this thing right. It helps keep us moving very fast. And I think that's kind of the key to kind of maintain velocity at scale, that most companies start to lose inherently as the number of things, and what the perceived number of important Things are goes up. And the second thing I'll say is just a long, like a very long-term future orientation. And you kind of have this idea that you're running at this thing that's really far out there. The process of just defining what those one to three things are, by the way, that's most important, is really just a function of trying to figure out what the one to three things are that Are the fastest accelerants to get us to that point. And Sam's has this maniacal focus on that future world. My job is just to fill in everything in between. ([Time 0:10:14](https://share.snipd.com/snip/51297c91-e7c6-4bc4-8b9e-dc74e37d5d3c))
