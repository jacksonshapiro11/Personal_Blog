  Tips on how to improve memory? Yes. Ron, Vared. Yes. Okay. This is a wild literature and I love it. And it's changing the way that I do things. I thought that to remember things, you're supposed to get really, really excited, really focused and remember them. And guess what? That's not how you do it. There are data and there are stories going back to medieval times that they used to teach kids things and then throw them in the river. There's a beautiful annual review of neuroscience written by the late James McGaugh, a brilliant researcher who taught me that in this review. And it turns out that if you want to remember something, you want to spike adrenaline after you acquired that information. After. That means the double espresso and the ice bath after you study for math. Immediately after. And you think about this, you know, that makes perfect sense, right? Think about the one trial learning that nobody wants to experience, which is a car accident or some traumatic thing. You didn't get the spike of adrenaline first. You got the spike of adrenaline after. So again, you know, I discourage the use of excessive stimulants or, you know, anything like that. But if you're going to try and remember information, you need to get your brain and body into a high autonomic arousal state. Literally, you need to deploy adrenaline into your system after you have made the attempt to learn some information. So much so that if you give people a beta blocker after learning emotional information, they don't learn it as well. Incredible. Just incredible data in animals and humans. This is the beautiful work of Larry Cahill at UC Irvine and James Maga. So that's how I would focus on remembering things better. And it's also true that if you tell yourself that something's really important to you, you'll be able to learn it better. If you meet people and they tell you their name and you forget two seconds later, well, you should probably be thinking, and now I do this, I meet people and I think, okay, what terrible thing did this person do? Just trying to spike my adrenaline or something like that. It's a terrible trick, but I haven't figured out a better way. But that's actually one that data supported way to do that. Easily a dozen or more studies in humans on that very topic. How do you manage social media addiction, Paul? Oi. Well, we should be careful with the use of the word addiction because here, I think it's entirely appropriate. When you're engaging in a behavior over and over and over again and you're thinking to yourself, this isn't even that interesting. You're officially addicted. That's the litmus test for addiction. Not this feels so good. People talk about the dopamine hits of social media. Those only come at the beginning. But then when you find yourself scrolling, like, what am I doing? Maybe it's that narrow visual aperture, you're a hypnotized chicken. ([Time 0:22:31](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2461702c-cf75-48a4-9531-3fb6ca9c15c3))
    - **Note:** Spiking adrenaline can help you remember after you learn something.
