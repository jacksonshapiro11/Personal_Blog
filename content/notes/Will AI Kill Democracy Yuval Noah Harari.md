### Highlights

- Episode AI notes
  1. Yuval Noah Harari discusses the complexities of truth in a world saturated with information, emphasizing that most information facilitates social connections rather than conveying factual truth.
  2. The naive assumption that more information leads to greater understanding is challenged, as abundant information can exacerbate confusion and misinformation, as seen in historical examples like the print revolution.
  3. Trust in information and institutions is vital for societal cohesion, with Harari underscoring the need to recognize the multifaceted nature of human motivations to foster a community that values truth.
  4. A bureaucrat's story during an epidemic illustrates the importance of truth-seeking over scapegoating, advocating for self-correcting mechanisms in our understanding of information.
  5. Harari highlights that trust, built on shared beliefs and stories, is fundamental for trade and societal cooperation, with money serving as a universal story that facilitates global transactions.
  6. The advent of written documents revolutionized ownership and authority, moving from communal agreements to defined individual rights, thereby strengthening centralized power and introducing new socio-economic constructs.
  7. The rise of AI presents both opportunities and challenges, with concerns over diminished human agency and the obfuscation of decision-making processes, particularly in sectors like finance.
  8. As AI becomes integral to daily life, Harari warns of the risks of mass surveillance and control, highlighting AI's fundamentally distinct decision-making as a new form of 'alien' intelligence. ([Time 0:00:00](https://share.snipd.com/episode-takeaways/cb7ad6cd-9ea8-4d88-9a04-cc200177e131))
- Truth is Costly, Information is Cheap
  Summary:
  Truth is a small subset of the vast amount of information in the world, primarily because most information does not aim to convey truth but instead facilitates connections among individuals.
  This connection-focused information, such as music, is essential for social cohesion, while factual information attempts to inform reality but can often be misleading or false. Producing truthful information is resource-intensive, requiring significant effort, time, and complexity, which makes it less appealing compared to the simplicity and cheapness of fiction.
  The painful nature of many truths further discourages its pursuit.
  In a landscape flooded with information, truth struggles to rise to the top due to these inherent disadvantages.
  Humans create large information networks to enhance cooperation and leverage collective resources, enabling advanced problem-solving capabilities compared to smaller groups, which struggle to survive and innovate alone. This suggests that the ability to harness information and create connections is a defining trait of Homo sapiens, empowering humans to control the world despite physical limitations.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 3
  Let's unpack a little bit the difference between truth and information. Do you see truth as a subset of information? Yes. And information is much grander? Unpack that difference for us. How is there information out there that exists? And then how is that separate from what is true?
  Speaker 1
  Well, I mean, there is enormous amount of information in human societies, in nature. The truth is a very, very small subset of that information. Most information in the world doesn't even attempt to tell the truth. I mean, the truth is something that points at reality, something that tries to point at an aspect of reality. And most information doesn't attempt to do it. The function of most information is not to tell us the truth, but to connect different individuals into a network. Information is connection. Think, for instance, about a paradigmatic case is music. Music, there is not even... It's not even reasonable to ask, is it true or not? There is no such thing as true music, and there is no such thing as fake music. There has been a lot of bad music throughout history, definitely. But there is no fake music. You know, it's all this true... Talk about fake news. What is fake music? It doesn't mean anything. What music does is connecting lots of people together. You go to church and you have these church music and change church hymns and you sing along with all the other congregation. It connects you together. You're a soldier on a military parade and you have these drums and these trumpets and you march together. It forms, it takes a lot of individuals, and military music helps turn a lot of single individuals into a cohesive military unit. You think about clubbers going to a club or to a party, the music connects them. But there is simply no, it's illogical to ask, but is it true or not? The music. There are some kinds of information that claim to tell us something about reality. They are not trying to construct a new reality, like in a military unit. They are trying to tell us something about reality. Like there is a piece of military intelligence that tells us there are now 1,000 Russian soldiers attacking a position in Ukraine. This is an attempt to point a finger at reality. And it could be true or false. Maybe there are 1,000 Russian soldiers there, maybe there are just 500, maybe there are 10,000. So here the question of truth arises. And most of this kind of information is not true. Most of this kind of information that try to point at reality is lies and fictions and delusions and illusions. Why? Because the truth is costly. Whereas fiction is very cheap. If you want to produce a truthful report about a military action in Ukraine, or about what happened in the Roman Empire in the time of Jesus Christ, or about the economic situation of A corporation, you need to invest a lot of time and effort and money. It's costly. If you just write the first things that comes to your mind, you just write fiction. That's very easy. You don't need to do any research. And in addition to that, even if you went to the trouble and did all the research and produced this costly and rare type of information, a truthful account, it has two main big disadvantages In the market of information compared to fiction. First, the truth tends to be complicated, because reality is complicated. That's part of the cost you pay. It's complication. Complicated to understand a pandemic, to understand a war. It's so complicated. And people, most of the time, we don't like complicated story. We like simple stories. Now, the truth has to be complicated because most of the time reality is fiction can be as simple as you would like it to be. So this is, again, one very big advantage of fiction. Simple. The other thing is the truth tends to be not always, but sometimes painful. Whether it's the truth about myself individually, like this is why we go to therapy, to realize how we hurt the loved ones in our life, how we hurt ourselves, it's not something nice often To learn about ourselves. It could be the, I don't know, the CEO of a corporation who learns truthful but painful things about his or her corporations and policies, that they made mistakes, that they are failing, Whatever, all the way to the level of a nation that, you know, in an election campaign, a politician who would tell people the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth about the History of our nation is unlikely to win many votes that way, because every nation, whether Israel or the United States or Russia or India, has a lot of, you know skeletons in sometimes Entire cemeteries in the closet, that people don't like to acknowledge. So again, the truth is costly, it's complicated, and it's often painful, whereas fiction is cheap, it's simple, can be made simple, and can be made as attractive as you would like it To be. So in a completely kind of free market of information, if you flood the world with information, the truth will not flow to the surface.
  Speaker 3
  I'm reminded of a Brandoli's law in internet culture where the bullshit asymmetry principle is easier to produce bullshit than it is to produce truth.
  Speaker 1
  But that's a much more...
  Speaker 3
  Rendoli law. Rendoli law, yeah.
  Speaker 1
  That's Rendoli. A much briefer way to explain what it took like 10 minutes. No, no, no. I love that. The stories are helpful. It's absolutely true.
  Speaker 2
  The idea that there is an economic cost, like almost like a proof of work, a proof of truth to truth, certainly rings true. Okay, so we've got the idea of information. We're separating that from truth. Truth is a particularly expensive form of information, but it's also a valuable form of information. Let's scale back out. Let's talk about information networks, once again. Why do humans create these information networks? What does it help us do? Is there some sort of scale we can achieve with these things? Like, why have we created them in the first place?
  Speaker 1
  They are much more powerful. You know, a country with a million people in it cooperating ([Time 0:10:59](https://share.snipd.com/snip/72fa3d9a-ab53-433e-a36c-125b4c69fbfd))
    - **Note:** The benefits of information networks and how it’s easier to produce lies vs truth so most news is fake. Networks create leverage. Humans ability to organize it networks is key to their survival. Truth vs information
- More Information Does Not Equal More Truth
  Summary:
  The naive view of information posits that increased information leads to greater understanding and truth, but this is fundamentally flawed.
  Simply flooding the world with more information does not enhance knowledge; instead, it often exacerbates confusion and leads to the spread of misinformation. Historical examples, such as the print revolution's relation to the wars of religion and witch hunts, illustrate that more information can result in significant societal harm rather than enlightenment.
  Additionally, the populist view, which reduces information to a mere tool for power struggles, also misses the complexity of human interactions and motivations.
  While power dynamics undoubtedly exist, this cynical perspective undermines the genuine pursuit of truth that drives many professions, including journalism and science.
  Trust in information and institutions is crucial for societal cohesion, and acknowledging the multifaceted nature of human motivations is essential for fostering a community that values truth alongside the recognition of power dynamics.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  But before we do, there's another thing I think we want to set up that you set up in your book, which is, I'll call these the two villains of the book. These are kind of negative attractor basins or like failure modes for when, how information networks can go wrong. And so the first villain is the naive view of information. These aren't actual villains, these are idea villains, let's say. And the second is kind of the populist view of information networks. Let's define both of those things. Cause I think it's going to be a recurring theme as we talk about the history of these information So what is the naive view of information, and why is it wrong?
  Speaker 1
  Well, the naive view, which is kind of the semi-official religion of places like Silicon Valley, is that more information is always good for us. That information is truth, or information is the raw material of truth. So if you just produce more and more information, if you just flood the world with more information, this will result necessarily, inevitably, in a rise in knowledge and wisdom and Life would improve. And this is simply wrong. This is a misunderstanding. As we said earlier, most information isn't truth. So, and again, information in a completely kind of free market of information, the truth is likely to lose to fiction, because fiction has these inherent advantages. It's cheaper to produce, it's more simple, and it's more attractive. And And it's no coincidence that we now have the most sophisticated information technology in history and people are losing the ability to talk with each other. You look at politics, let's say, in the United States, you can disagree about many, many things. But one thing that Democrats and Republicans, I think, could agree on is that the conversation is simply breaking down. That people can no longer agree on even basic facts, that people can no longer hold a reasoned debate and listen to each other. So we have this seemingly paradox that the most sophisticated information technology in history and a breakdown in the conversation. And if you think, oh, this is just unique American phenomena because of this unique social or political condition of the US, no. You see, the same thing is happening in Brazil, the same thing is happening in France, the same thing is happening in the Philippines. Of social situation of a specific country, but of the underlying information technology, which is based on this naive view that we just need to increase the volume and speed of information And everything would be okay. And again, this is a lesson that should have been learned many, many centuries ago, because every time a new information technology appears, see the same thing. I hear people in Silicon Valley give these historical examples, like the way that the print revolution led to the scientific revolution. This is nonsense. The print revolution did not lead to the scientific revolution. At least about 200 years had to pass between Gutenberg and his printing press in the middle of the 15th century, until you see the flowering of the scientific revolution in the 17th century. What you have in between is a period when Europe is flooded with new information coming from the printing press, but most of it is junk and it leads to the worst peak of the wars of religion In Europe in the 16th and 17th century, with the 30 years war being probably the worst war in European history until the world wars of the 20th century. You see the peak of the witch hunt craze. Witch hunting, which we associate often with the Middle Ages, it's actually a modern phenomenon which has a lot to do with the print revolution. Europeans in the Middle Ages didn't care very much about witches. But after print came along, a conspiracy theory appeared that there is a global conspiracy of Satan worshiping witches, which tries to destroy human civilization. And some of the biggest bestsellers of early modern Europe advanced this conspiracy theory. It was not, people did not read Copernicus and with his complicated mathematical calculations about astronomy. This was boring. They preferred, I mean, the biggest bestseller was a book called The Hammer of the Witches. And just to give you a flavor of what this book was like, there was a chapter in The Hammer of the Witches, again, biggest bestseller in late 15th century Europe, about how witches steal Penises from men. So this is like 1500s fake news. This is 1500, the QAnon fake news. QAnon. QAnon. And it's like, they bring evidence, like the author Heinrich Klemel, who was a completely deluded and mentally unstable person, but he shaped the world with the printing press, with His book. He tells the story of a man who wakes up in the morning to discover that his penis is gone.
  Speaker 2
  So, and... Nightmare scenario.
  Speaker 1
  So, nightmare scenario. So he goes to the village witch because he suspects that she stole his penis. And then the village witch manages to coerce or bring me back my penis. And she says, okay, okay, okay, climb this tree and you find a bird's nest at the top of the tree. So he climbs the tree, finds a bird's nest. In the bird's nest, he finds a lot of penises that the witch stole from different men in the village. And she said, okay, you can take yours, but he wants to take the biggest one. So she tells him, no, no, no, no, you can't take that one. This one belongs to the parish priest. Now, this was number one bestseller.
  Speaker 3
  Was it meant to be a story or was it meant to be truth? This was supposed to be truth. This was supposed to be truth.
  Speaker 1
  This is supposed to to be truth. There is a dangerous conspiracy of Satan worshiping witches. They kill children. They have these cannibalistic OGs. They worship Satan. They summon hellstorm. Like the last hellstorm in the village that destroyed your crops. This was because of the witches. I mean, very entertaining though. I would read that book. It led to the murder of tens of thousands of people in the most unspeakable way. This was the fuel of the big European witch hunts. When people were burned as the state, tortured. One case which I explore in Enexus is the case of the Papenheimer family, a family in Munich, in Germany, around 1600, that was arrested for allegedly being witches. And you have a mother and father and three ([Time 0:25:16](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4da75e82-0b37-442f-9cf0-487d2a4bcc30))
    - **Note:** New ways to spread information leads to more fake news than real tangible insightful truth seeking initially. People like stupid content. Naieve view of information. It’s not about advancing truth with information but spinning your narrative and grabbing power. You can’t be independent. The way to counter this is with the science mindset and critical approach professionalized in our institutions. Create self correcting mechanisms for information
- Seek Truth, Not Scapegoats
  Summary:
  The story of a bureaucrat navigating an epidemic illustrates the importance of seeking truth rather than succumbing to scapegoating.
  This approach not only leads to more effective solutions but also highlights the necessity of self-correcting mechanisms within our understanding of information. A naive or overly cynical perspective on information can hinder progress, as evidenced by the complexities of modern urban environments like New York City.
  By examining historical information networks, we can better anticipate challenges in our current computer age, leveraging lessons learned to shape future communication and knowledge systems.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  What's so interesting, I think about that story of the bureaucrat who figured out the epidemic outbreak, is it sort of demonstrates what you've been talking about, which it would have Been very easy for that bureaucrat to read the hammer of the witches. And we saw this epidemic outbreak and just say, oh, there's more witches to burn. Let's, you know, let's, let's get it.
  Speaker 1
  Let's find the witch and burn her and the epidemic will be over. Right.
  Speaker 2
  She did the costly thing of actually finding out the truth and figuring out what reality is. And we all reap the benefits of that. So as we're going through the rest of this conversation, I feel like there's a one thing that your books often do for me is like they unlock mental models. And so we've got a mental model of the naive view of information. The thing that maybe starts to solve that is self-correcting mechanisms. We've got that piece. And we've got another mental model of the populist view of information, which is too nihilistic. It's too cynical. I mean, look at what we've created. If that was true, we could never have a city like New York City a nation state, like, so that clearly also can't be true. Now what I'd like to do is go through back in history. And you said one of the things earlier in our conversation that one of the most useful things we can actually do is understand our information networks. So I want to go back in history so that we can anticipate and take some lessons into the next information network, which is basically the network that we're living in, the computer age. But before we get there, let's do a brief history of information networks. And for me, there was a game you've all used to play all the time, it's called civilization. Okay, if you've ever played this. Yes. Basically, you start with some land and some resources and your civilization has to unlock a tech tree. ([Time 0:52:09](https://share.snipd.com/snip/267d13e1-2db0-4cee-a558-1d3d7615d3b8))
    - **Note:** Populist view of information is too cynical like deep state stuff. Easy to blame hard to correct.
- Trust and Trade: The Power of Shared Stories
  Summary:
  Trust is the foundation of trade, particularly when dealing with strangers.
  Unlike other species, humans developed intersubjective realities—shared beliefs and stories—that foster trust and coordination, enabling trade and societal cooperation. Symbols, such as religious icons or distinctive attire, serve as markers of shared beliefs, facilitating trust among individuals who may not know each other.
  Money exemplifies this concept as it is a successful story that everyone believes in, allowing transactions to occur on a global scale despite differing political factions.
  The qualitative nature of stories, whether they uplift or cause harm, also determines their impact on society.
  Thus, the efficacy of shared stories in shaping human interaction and economic systems underscores the intricate relationship between belief, trust, and cooperation.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Now, how do you exchange or trade flint with people you don't really know, people from another band? You don't see chimpanzees do it. You don't see evidence for that with Neanderthals. We think about trade as something natural. Oh, of course, it's good for me. It's good for you. Let's trade. If that was so, why is it that no other animal except Homo sapiens trades? Because interest is not enough. You need trust. In order to trade with somebody, you need to trust them. Now, the biggest question in trade, in much of human history, is how do you trust strangers? It's easy to trust your own band members, family, friends. How do you trust strangers? And this is where stories come. Stories are a technology to create trust between strangers. I believe in this big spirit, you believe in the same spirit. I don't know you personally, but because we both believe in the same spirit, I trust you. And how do I know that you believe in the same spirit as me? Maybe you have some kind of distinctive headgear that indicates that you believe in the same spirit as me. So now if you log on the streets of New York, you will see it. People going with different funny hats and the hats telling like two Jews that never met in their life, they immediately know, oh, he's also Jewish. Why? Because he has the same funny hat that I'm wearing. So I can trust him or her, which means that there is a basis also for economic cooperation. And it's no wonder that you look at the American dollar, it's not the Stone Age, it's also the modern era. You look at the US dollar, what's written on it in God with trust. There is no dollar without some God or some mythology. So like in China, they don't have God, so they have Chairman Mao on all their M&B. And in Mao we trust. He's the ancestral spirit. And if I trust Mao and you trust Mao, we can cooperate.
  Speaker 2
  That's what's so fascinating about these stories. You have this concept of the difference between subjective reality and intersubjective reality. And I think that's a really important differentiation. So subjective reality would be something that a reality inside of my own head as an individual. But what Homo sapiens does, what we do as humans is we create these intersubjective realities, these stories that we share and we all believe collectively together and we use these To coordinate on things. And when you say stories, I just want to make this clear, you're not just talking about mythologies, fairy tales, this type of thing. You think of like a corporation is a story. Money, as you were talking about earlier in the episode, is also a story. Why? Because it's an intersubjective reality. We all believe the dollar is valued at whatever. CPI, the price I can purchase this basket of goods for. Because, why?
  Speaker 1
  We all believe it. You can't eat or drink a dollar. There is nothing useful you can do with it. But as long as everybody trusts it, you can go to a complete stranger and give them a dollar bill and get a piece of bread or an apple that you can eat. And you look at the United States today, and one of the last stories that still connects everybody is the story of money. Democrats and Republicans can hardly agree about anything, but they still use the same money. And they still use the same price system. They can still agree on the price of a gallon of gasoline. They don't even think about questioning it.
  Speaker 2
  It's not like one party's like, we're going to create our own, you know, unit and it's going to be called...
  Speaker 1
  And we can't. What would happen if this would be the case? I mean, then we really see societal collapse. If people can no longer trust even the, and in many ways, money is the most successful story ever told because it's the one story that almost everybody believes and agree on. And if this goes, then it's really chaos.
  Speaker 3
  So there's two aspects of a good story that I want to get your take on. One is scale. One reason why money is such a good story is because it scales.
  Speaker 1
  Successful. I mean, good or not depends what you do with it, but it is very successful.
  Speaker 3
  Right. Very successful, yes. And so one aspect, one successful aspect is how far can the scale. If you take a dollar to basically any country in the world, you can generally trade it for what it's worth. Successful story. And then there's also an idea of how aligned with truth that story may or may not be. Perhaps the Constitution of the United States is a story that's more aligned with reality than a religious document. How do you think about like the qualitative nature of like whether these stories are good or not?
  Speaker 1
  You know the basic question is whether the consequences are harmful. Whether it creates more misery and suffering and violence in the world, the story, or whether the story helps us to alleviate suffering. So again, you think about a religious story. It can be used for both purposes. You can use religious ideals and mythologies in stories about Jesus in order to inspire people to be more compassionate, to donate to charity, to build a hospital. And then it doesn't matter if what they tell you about Jesus is true or not, or if the image, the portrait of Jesus that hangs in your house, whether it's a true liking of the actual man who Lived in the Galilee, like 2000 years ago, or no, doesn't matter. If it inspires you to help people, then it's a good story. But you can use exactly the same story to start a religious war, to persecute minorities, to start an inquisition, a witch hunt. And then that's terrible. And the story can go, usually the story can go both ways. ([Time 0:56:36](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2e7f570e-f68d-401f-bc95-3ff60d50b953))
    - **Note:** The power of the stories we tell ourselves. Humans scale trust through stories.
- The Transformation of Ownership and Power through Written Records
  Summary:
  The advent of written documents revolutionized the concept of ownership and authority.
  Initially, ownership relied on communal agreement, limiting individual rights and empowering local communities to dictate land usage. With the introduction of written records, ownership shifted to a defined, individual right represented by physical documents, enhancing personal freedom to trade property without community consent.
  This transformation also strengthened the power of centralized authorities by providing a means to track ownership and enforce taxation across vast territories, leading to the emergence of authoritarian kingdoms.
  Written records facilitated the creation of new social constructs like property rights and credit systems, allowing for complex economic interactions beyond small community ties.
  For instance, ancient Assyrian debt tablets exemplified how physical documents embodied debts, meaning their destruction effectively nullified financial obligations. This duality of written records highlights that information technologies can simultaneously liberate and constrain society, depending on their application and governance.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And they discovered that if you take a read or a stick and make imprints in the mud, you can preserve these boring lists instead of in your brain that can't hold them. And this is the birth of the written document. And it leads to a major revolution, social, political, economic. If you think about ownership again, what does it mean to own a field? If you live in a society without written records, then to own a field means that all the neighbors in your community agree that this is your field and they don't graze their goats there And they don't pick fruits there without your permission. So, ownership is a communal affair. It's a communal agreement. Which means, on the one hand, that it limits individual rights. You can't sell your field to somebody else unless the community agrees, because the community defines ownership. It also limits the power of distant authorities, like a king in some distant capital. The king can't know who owns what field in every distant village, because there are no records, so it's very difficult to build these centralized authoritarian kingdoms.
  Speaker 3
  Yeah, the information didn't span very well. Yeah.
  Speaker 1
  It's an agreement between a couple of neighbors. How would the king know who owns what and how much tax everybody should pay? Then you have the written document and ownership changes its meaning. Now to own a field means that there is a piece of dry mud which says that this field is mine. And today it's the same. To own a field or a house today means that there is a piece of paper or there is some electronic data which says that this field is mine. That's it. This is ownership. Now, on the one hand, it potentially increases individual rights, because now I can sell my field to somebody without getting the permission of my neighbors. I just, he or she gives me, I don't know, some gold, and I give them this piece of mud or this piece of paper, and now they own the field. That's it. So this increases individual freedom. At the same time, it also increases the power of distant authorities because now the king can know who owns what in thousands of distant villages. He has an archive with all these dry pieces of mud recording who owns what, and this is the basis for a taxation system, and he can tax everybody and pay bodyguards and soldiers, and you See the rise of the first centralized authoritarian kingdoms and empires in Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt around the same time. So like with every information technology, it's very important to realize it usually goes both ways. The same technology can liberate us and the same technology can enslave us depending on what we do with it.
  Speaker 2
  It can either liberate us or save us, but it certainly does. Or enslave us. But it certainly does in either case scale us. You know, like in terms of the capability and our power. I want to dive into that a little bit more because as you can imagine, like on bankless, we are pretty much obsessed with this story of what you just described of kind of like money and property Rights. And to see how it originated where we have these stories that were kind of myths and that translates from human to human, very easy. You can recall it, you hear a good story, you want to tell someone else. You know, you can memorize it. What documents unlocked for us was all of the boring side of things. And so one of our first writing technologies that we created in Sumeria is the cuneiform tablets and the ledger. And so from that, from these lists, from this ledger, we essentially are able to create new intersubjective realities like property rights, like credit. Oh, how do I, you owe me something? Usually it would be in a small tribe setting, it would be reputational. Okay. You know, Yuval owes me such and such because I did Y favor, right? But now we can record the sort of ownership in some sort of centrally managed bureaucratic ledger. And that indeed is incredibly important. I think one example of this that I loved from your book, and I'm wondering if you'd kind of share the story here, is the old Assyrian document. Yeah. Okay. So they would literally, and this is an example of taking an intersubjective reality and translating it into some physical form, but they would have a debt tablets, would they not? And if you pay your debt, they would actually like break the tablet. How did that work? What's that?
  Speaker 1
  If you took a loan for somebody, then your debt is that there is a clay tablet that says you own that person 10 pieces of silver. And this is the debt. The debt is this clay tablet. And if you pay back the loan, then in all the Syrian dialect, they would say that the document is killed. The debt is killed. And they would actually physically take the clay tablet, which records the debt, and break it. And so the debt is now dead. That's over. No more debt. Now, what happens if the dog ate the debt? Like, an Assyrian merchant kept your debt, the display tablet, in his house and the dog came and ate it. It also died. That's it. There is no more debt. And what happens on the other hand, if you repaid the loan, but for some reason you forgot or you couldn't break the document, then you still own it. And again, it may sound strange to us, but today, again, a simple thing like money, if you have a five-dollar bill and the dog ate it, that's it. These five dollars are gone. So the debt is not something that... It's not that you have the document and the document points to something in reality. There is a debt out there in the world and the document simply points at it. No, the document is the debt. And if you destroy the document, there is no more debt. And this happens many times. You see it in rebellions, in popular revolts throughout history. One of the first things that the rebels do is to destroy the central archive. Because they know if we burn all these papers that record our debts, the debts are gone.

    - **Note:** How documents preserve stories and why when something is taken over the rebels always destroy the information first. Information can be used to liberate and give us ownership or enslave us like debt.
- Power Shift: Embrace the Alien Intelligence
  Summary:
  Human error primarily drives most societal issues, yet the rise of AI introduces both opportunities and challenges.
  While AI can eliminate human errors, it raises concerns about diminishing human agency as it increasingly dictates decisions across various sectors. The pervasive adoption of AI may redefine concepts of ownership, making human understanding of these decisions increasingly obscure.
  This shift is particularly evident in finance, where AI's ability to process data far surpasses human capacity, potentially leading to a system where no human can comprehend its complexities.
  As AI becomes interwoven with everyday life, it could replicate the social media engagement algorithms that prioritize content engagement over meaningful interaction.
  Additionally, the risk of mass surveillance looms large, reminiscent of totalitarian regimes, amplifying concerns about privacy and control. The emergence of AI introduces a new form of intelligence—alien not in the extraterrestrial sense, but in its fundamentally distinct decision-making processes, posing profound implications for humanity's future.

  Speaker 1
  Most of them are caused by human error, like a driver drinking alcohol and driving or falling asleep at the wheel. This is something AI won't do. So it has enormous positive potential. It also has enormous negative potential, And this goes back to the issues of power. We are losing power. Every previous technology gave humanity more power. This is the first technology that potentially takes power away from us because it increasingly makes the decisions about us and shapes the world according to its view of the world, Not according to our view of the world. If you think, for instance, about ownership. So AI is not going to be one big computer somewhere. It's going to be millions, maybe billions of agents everywhere. Think about millions of AI bureaucrats in every government office and corporation and university and whatever. And these AI bureaucrats making decisions about us. So what does it mean that I own a house? It means that some AI says that I own the house. How does the AI decide whether I own it or not? I have no idea. Part of the problem with the rise of AI is that, and again, I'm not talking about this Hollywood science fiction scenario of robots shooting people. It's about the AI in the government office or in the corporation that decides who owns what. And it will be increasingly difficult for human beings to understand how the AI decides things because it's inherently an alien intelligence. The acronym AI, it traditionally stood for artificial intelligence, but I think it's better to think about it as alien intelligence, not alien in the sense of coming from outer space. Alien in the sense that it makes decisions and creates idea in a fundamentally different way than the organic brain of human beings. It can process immense amounts of data. It can think on a mathematical level, which is simply impossible for human beings. It's relentless, it's tireless, it never needs to rest or to sleep or to go hang out with friends, if you think about the financial system, for instance. So this is the playground, the ideal playground for AI is finance, because it's a purely informational and mathematical realm. In self-driving vehicles, every year they say next year, and it's still not coming, because it's very difficult for an AI to interact with the massive physical reality of a New York Street. Very difficult. But the New York Stock Exchange, it's perfect for AIs. It's just data, data in, data out. So what happens when AI takes over finance? What happens if, which is happening all around us, what happens if it starts creating financial devices that no human being is capable of understanding, because they are just mathematically Orders of magnitude more complex than the human brain is capable of handling. So, it's not necessarily bad, but it means that we are losing control. We are losing... If today, I don't know, maybe 1% of humanity understands the financial system, and I think this is a huge overstate, overestimate, in 10 years it could be zero. That because of AI, the financial system just becomes so complicated that it doesn't matter how smart you are or whether you went to college or whatever, it's just beyond the human capacity.
  Speaker 2
  You talk about some of the downstream effects that we've seen in the early stages of these AI agents and making decisions for us. And of course, in the other previous manifestations of information technology like stories and writing, it was all human to human, making the decisions in the network. Now we have another entrant, which is some AI making decisions. And you talk about this idea of social media engagement algorithms being sort of the dress rehearsal for future AI agents. And basically, they are trained to just give you the most engaging piece of content that will capture your eyeballs for just like one more minute, one more minute. And we've sort of seen how that's gone. It's created a lot of fast food style content for us. So we've got that problem as kind of a dress rehearsal. And we also have another problem as we enter this computer digital age, which is mass surveillance.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, that's a huge, huge problem.
  Speaker 2
  You take the Soviet Union in the 1930s and you just extrapolate that forward. Imagine if Stalin had the capabilities of AI agents and all of this digital data and the ability to kind of like monitor you. So there are these two almost attractor basins. ([Time 1:16:55](https://share.snipd.com/snip/04b7d209-f9e3-4ffb-9b5d-9391238b6aea))
    - **Note:** Ai is the first technology that doesn’t enhance but surpasses humans. It will take over finance and its agents could form a perfect surveillance state. This is the first invention in which were giving up power not empowering us.
