  Speaker 1
  So push the pause button like nobody's worried about we're not evaluated off of wins and losses. Exactly. It would just be relationship driven. If we could have the players 24 hours, a day, obviously you got to sleep for a certain amount of time, but it would be phones are away or building relationships with each other. We're intentional one on one, two on two, 11 on 11. We are building relationships with each other. And the problem is we're evaluated off of 12 guaranteed opportunities. And sometimes our players can look at those wins and losses or look at am I starting or looking at the output instead of what truly is going to help them improve. And so I think it starts with relationships, then it doesn't matter where you are in a depth chart. It is that how can you truly improve your individualized skills. Don't worry about outputs right now. Don't worry about that. Just worry about improving as a player. So if we can build relationships with each other and then everybody find a way to be the best version of them, that is a challenge. Don't worry about outcomes, best version of you, build it every single day. Then if we can do that and you have a strong brotherhood and relationships, that's where magic is going to happen.
  Speaker 3
  Marcus would make a really good long-term investor.
  Speaker 4
  If you don't look at the outputs, you'll be able to culture. Yeah. You'll wait five years for the stock or whatever the company to do well. Yeah. Delayed. That's what we say. Delayed. Gratification.
  Speaker 2
  At one point, I heard you lay out your three standards. And I'm just going to list them real quickly. Challenge everything. Unit strength, which you say is really love. We're going to come back to that. And competitive spirit. And one thing that strikes me is all three of those are very clear inputs. They don't have anything to do with what happens from outcomes of wins and losses. So we have our own set of core principles as investors. And actually, we have four, but the first one and the most important one is love wins. So we have our own reasons for how we've been able to finagle love into the investing equation. But maybe just say a little bit more about you're trying to fit a lot into those distill into three standards. How does love fit into the equation?
  Speaker 1
  So when we say unit strength, it's a term with that means choose to love. And I explain it them every day. Love is a choice. Trust is earned, but love is a choice and should be freely given. We have to choose every day to love each other. Choose to put somebody else in front of myself, selfless, other centered. But it's a choice every day we have to make because if we go off how we naturally feel, we're naturally selfish people. It's about what's best for us. What am I getting? What's in it for me? But we need you to be other center, choose to love your teammates. And so I use that in reference to when they become husbands and fathers. I said, every day, you've got to choose and love your wife. You don't understand it yet because you don't have a wife. Maybe a girlfriend, but you have to choose to love as a father. You have to choose every day to display your love to your children. And so I just want to understand when you walk into this building, we have a sign that says choose hard. It is not natural to choose to love others, but you have to make that choice every single day. And if we have that and put others in front of ourselves, then special things are going to come from that. ([Time 0:27:04](https://share.snipd.com/snip/00bd763f-5686-4b7d-aaec-e5a0330cc16a))
