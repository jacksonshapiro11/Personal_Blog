### Highlights

- **Hidden Potential and Meaning**
  - Many people feel they aren't reaching their potential, but potential isn't fixed. 
  - We all have hidden potential that can be unlocked through coaching and recognizing opportunities for growth.
  - Meaning in work comes from understanding your impact and who benefits from your efforts. 
  - Considering who would be worse off if your work didn't exist helps clarify your purpose and contribution. 
  - Finding meaning is key to fulfilling potential and feeling valued.
  Transcript:
  Chris Williamson
  It's, is there more potential potential that could have been fulfilled? Potential potential. I love this idea, Chris.
  Adam Grant
  I think, you know, a lot of people, I think, experience, they feel pressure around this or regret or both. I'm not living up to my potential. And what they forget is that potential is not fixed. Yeah, you have a floor that's determined by your current level of skill. And you have a ceiling, but that ceiling is not set in stone. It's dependent on changes in your skill and shifts in your motivation and the opportunities that are put in front of you. And I think what's striking to me is that what I lived as a diver is true for all of us. We all have hidden potential, which is a capacity for growth that might be invisible to you. And it might also be invisible to some of the people around you. And you just haven't recognized it yet. And I think that so many of us, we confront people who are critics, who basically attack the worst version of ourselves, or cheerleaders who applaud the best version of ourselves. And what we want are those coaches who see our hidden potential and help us become a better version of ourselves. And so I think the question is less, am I living up to my potential? And more, what is my hidden potential? And how do I realize it?
  Chris Williamson
  Yeah, the compliments versus criticisms thing is super interesting to me. I think I would identify myself as a criticism hyper responder, that I weight the value of somebody who doesn't like my work significantly higher than a lot of people who do like my work. And over time, that can cause you to take more heed from people who don't have your best interests at heart, as opposed to the ones that do, which, you know, in the cold, harsh light of day, Unemotionally is awful. It's a poor strategy, right? Like, let's face it, that's not optimal. But there is something about that. And then I guess on the other side, somebody who takes too much heed from the compliments is never going to have an accurate assessment of where the competence level is at. They're not going to work on the things that they need to, perhaps the basics, perhaps going back to the start, perhaps realizing why it is that they're failing. I'm great. I've never encountered any problems. Why does this keep on happening to me? This is unfair. And maybe that's where a victim mindset comes from. I'm not sure.
  Adam Grant
  Yeah, I think that's right. I think you're being a little too hard on yourself when you talk about the perils of being a criticism junkie, which I guess it's on brand. I'm even going to criticize myself for the fact that I'm too obsessed. Respond to criticism.
  Chris Williamson
  Yep. Correct. So you're a medic. Permeates deep. Permeates deep.
  Adam Grant
  Well, I get it, but I want to defend it a little bit. I'm thinking about some research that Ayelet Fischbach did where she finds that novices are more drawn to and motivated by praise because they need to believe that they're capable Of getting better. Otherwise, it's just too discouraging to be bad at something. But that experts are more interested in criticism. Like, okay, I don't need somebody to convince me that I can be good. I just want to know how I can get better. So I think that that is a mark of being somebody who's truly driven to master a craft. I think where maybe you get yourself in trouble from what I'm hearing is you're not filtering out. Well, let me back up a step and say, not all critics are actually thinking critically. And not all critics are speaking constructively. So there needs to be a finely tuned and filter around, you said, does this person have my best interests at heart? Endorse. I agree wholeheartedly with that. I also want to ask, does this person have credible knowledge about the domain you're trying to improve in? And do they have credible knowledge about you? Because somebody who doesn't know your world, or doesn't know your potential, not a good judge of what you need to work on. Yeah. Yeah.
  Chris Williamson
  What do you think most people don't realize about where meaning comes from? Because it seems here like we're talking about this sort of grander sense of purpose, something that pulls us forward. It's kind of structural in the beliefs that we have and the people that are around us, but it's also a little bit more transcendent. It's kind of out there. So from a scientific perspective, when it comes to performance and potential, what do people miss about meaning? I think that meaning is ultimately about mattering.
  Adam Grant
  It's about knowing that you're valued by others and you have value to add to others. And I think in a lot of cases, it's pretty abstract and people don't really know, okay, what is my contribution? Why do people appreciate me? So I studied this early in my career. I was studying fundraising callers at the University of Michigan. And they were basically calling alumni and trying to convince them to make donations. And it was a hard, stressful job. You're interrupting somebody's dinner. They yell at you. They're like, I already donated to this school. It's called my tuition. Why are you asking me for more? And I went in to try to motivate these callers. And I didn't know whether to laugh or cry when I saw this sign on the wall that one of the callers had posted. It said, doing a good job here is like wetting your pants in a dark suit. You get a warm feeling, but no one else notices. I mean, talk about a crisis of meaning. Yeah. So I designed a simple experiment. It takes five minutes. Some of the callers are randomly assigned to a five-minute interaction. A month later, the average caller is spending 142% more time on the phone per week and bringing in 171% more weekly revenue. So to make that more concrete, a month later, after a five-minute interaction, the average caller has more than doubled in weekly phone time and nearly tripled in weekly revenue. What happened in that five-minute interaction? All I did was bring in one scholarship student who said, because of the money you raise, I am able to afford school. And here's how it's changed my life. And here's how I'm trying to pay it forward. And all of a sudden, the meaning of the work changes. This job is not a job where I'm harassing people and ruining their night. It's a job where I'm enabling students to go to school. And I think that this is something we could probably all do more of, right? I think it's easy in a job to lose sight of what your impact is. It's worth asking, if my work didn't exist, if I weren't doing this job, who would be worse off? And the people who come to mind, they are the ones who make your work matter. They're the reason that you have meaning in your job. And you can apply this to any role, right? You could ask that question as a parent. You could ask that question as a community member or a family or a friend, right? Who would be worse off if I weren't playing this role? That's where meaning comes from.

- **Be a Role Model to Your Younger Self**
  * Adam Grant shares an anecdote about a friend challenging him to celebrate his second book launch.
  * This prompted Grant to reflect on his progress and realize he'd taken his achievements for granted.
  * He suggests imagining a younger version of yourself and considering if they would be proud of your current accomplishments and values as a measure of growth.
  * This perspective shift can help navigate uncertainty and acknowledge meaningful progress, even without a clear roadmap.
  * We often get over trauma much quicker than we think what could be perceived to take 5 years to get over really takes 6 months 
  * If we’re not failing enough we’re failing ourselves
  Transcript:
  Adam Grant
  I remember I was getting ready to launch my second book. So we're going back almost a decade now. And a friend called and asked me what I was doing to celebrate. And I said, nothing. And she said, why? I said, well, I'm an author. That's what we do. We write books. It's part of my routine. And she said, yeah, but it's not like you write a book every day. Publishing a book is a milestone. What are you doing to savor that? And I thought about it and I realized I had completely taken for granted the idea that I was just going to write a book every few years. And I had no sense of whether my second book was better than my first book. I had no way to gauge whether I had improved in the areas I was trying to grow. And I realized that I had to do some mental time travel and think back to a younger, earlier version of myself. So I went back five years earlier and I said, okay, if that version of me knew that I was going to publish one book, let alone two, that would have been nirvana. That would have been a career milestone. And also that version of me would have been really impressed with the progress I'd made in a couple of areas that I thought I hadn't improved at all in the short term. And I think that that's one way of managing uncertainty, right? Is to say, okay, if a younger version of me is proud of where I am right now, that is a sign that I've grown. And if that earlier version of me isn't proud of the progress that I've made, it might be time to change courses. Yeah, it's fascinating.
  Chris Williamson
  I wonder how many people would have loved to have had themselves now as a role model when they were a kid, and they're just totally blind to it.
  Adam Grant
  I think that's a beautiful way to frame it. I think that if you are at a point where you're a great role model for your younger self, I think that is a sign that you've not only achieved something worth doing, but you've probably Developed a set of values and demonstrated a level of character that, you know, that is worth appreciating. And, you know, I think that in the moment, it's really hard to know whether you're moving in the right direction. And I think a lot of us get frustrated when you talk about uncertainty. It's frustrating to feel like, well, I don't have a map because the challenge I'm trying to take on is amorphous or the goals that I'm setting, they're ambitious enough that I don't know Exactly what the steps are to get from where I am today to where I want to be in the future. And I think it's not realistic to have a map in a dynamic and uncertain world. What's much more plausible is to have a compass, which is to ask, is this the right next step? Does it feel directionally correct? Is it taking me closer to my values and my goals? Or is it moving me away from those? Is it making me more like the people that I admire or less like them? And I think that compass is frankly all we need. And it's much more realistic than the perfect map.
  Chris Williamson
  Is there a line between this comfort with uncertainty and comfort with the idea of failing, of taking risk, of being a little bit more daring?
  Adam Grant
  I think so. I think that the fear of failure stops a lot of people from growing, right? Happens is you don't want to you don't want to embarrass yourself and you don't want to take a blow to your self-esteem so you basically start to keep doing the things you're already good At and over time you you become more and more concerned about making a mistake you become increasingly perfectionistic your comfort zone gets smaller and you don't benefit from trial And error. So one of the ways that I've tried to navigate this recently is I actually have a goal of having three things fail every year. Okay. How have you gotten this year? I've only had two so far, so I need to step on the gas. I don't set out trying to fail at anything. Let's be clear. I'm not like, all right, let me take on a project that is deliberately going to bomb. Rather, what I'm trying to do is set the expectation that if I don't have three projects fail, it means that I'm not aiming high enough and I'm not stretching myself far enough. And the upside of that then is that when something does crash and burn, I can say, okay, that checks off one of the failures for 2024 or 2025. And I think that, look, we're all going to fail in a few things if we are pushing ourselves. And I think expecting that makes it a lot easier to stomach.
  Chris Williamson
  Not failing regularly or at least not failing not failing intermittently uh is that an indication that you could be taking a little bit more risk i think so i think if if at first you don't
  Adam Grant
  Succeed it's it's a sign that you're you're actually aiming high enough and if you are you know consistently either hitting your goals or exceeding your expectations, it probably Means you could be pushing yourself a little bit farther, or you could be at least trying something that's a little bit less familiar and easy for you.
  Chris Williamson
  How debilitating is failure if we encounter it versus how we feel about it when fearing it in advance. I don't know if there's been any studies done on this, the fear of failure versus the sensation of failure, the experience of failure. Yeah, I think you've already anticipated where my favorite research on this goes.
  Adam Grant
  So this is Dan Gilbert and his colleagues, a group of psychologists, Gilbert and Wilson, I think are two of the best. What they show is they study what's called affective forecasting, which is you make a prediction about how you're going to feel if something bad happens. And then you wait for some of those bad things to happen. And then you follow people and ask them, how do you actually feel? And most of us dramatically overestimate how much failure is going to sting and also how long that sting is going to last. So one of the places where Dan and his colleagues studied this was with professors who are about to go up for tenure. And this is the ultimate gauntlet as an academic. If you succeed, you get to keep your job and you also have lifetime job security. If you fail, you probably have to move. Your reputation is in tatters and you feel like you just couldn't cut it in your field and maybe you should choose an entirely different career. And now you don't know if you'll ever have that permanent job security. So not surprisingly, people think on average, it's going to take five years for them to recover ([Time 0:17:59](https://share.snipd.com/snip/511c1420-0c9e-441c-a8d0-b6e6232786bd))
- **Soliciting Feedback**
  * When requesting feedback, instead of asking how to improve, ask what could be cut. Addition by subtraction. Also get feedback often so it doesn’t feel bad when you get feedback and you can improve faster. 
  * This avoids the addition bias and helps identify weak points to refine the remaining content.
  Transcript:
  Chris Williamson
  Because again, the desirability for people to not hurt your feelings sort of hold strong typically is if you had to cut 20% from this talk, just tell me what would you get rid of? What would be top of the list? What would be the, because for the most part, your good stuff's probably going to be good, but it's the really weak stuff that needs to go first.
  Adam Grant
  That's what should be triaged to be thrown out. Oh, I love that you pointed this out, Chris. It reminds me of Letty Klotz and Gabrielle Adams's research where they show that when you ask people how to change, like, how can I improve? How can our team improve? What most people do is they add. They give you more things to do. And they forget that our plates are already pretty full. And one of the best ways to improve something is to cut away what's not working, to subtract. And this sort of addition bias or addiction to always adding things, it doesn't help us as often as it seems like it would. And so I love your prompt to say, okay, if you were going to cut 20%, what is the fat that could be trimmed in this presentation? And that creates room then for the gems to actually be polished. I'm thinking about the role of emotions in all of this.
  Chris Williamson
  You know, so much of what we've been talking about have been strategies to compensate or ways that we see ourselves. And it's this sort of degree of rationality. I'm stepping out a little bit. I'm sort of above looking down on the situation. But the felt sense day to day is you're just swimming in your own hormones and neurochemistry. So what? Well, actually, I mean, you talk about pessimism not being an effective strategy for protecting emotions. That's obviously one compensatory mechanism. People become cynical. They try to believe that they insulate themselves from having to feel the pain of failure by never just trying in the first place.

- **Balancing Anxiety with Excitement**
  * When feeling anxious about a future event, acknowledge potential downsides, but also remember the potential upsides and reasons for committing in the first place. Anxiety is when we care about things outside our control so we focus on what we can control. Get psychological Distance from an event to view the situation objectively. 
  * We want to prove ourselves. We become so deep in our habits to improve ourself they become second nature. What drives us is our own standards and that’s expectations. 
  * Create zone of acceptable failure make 20% of material is new. 
  * Happiness = reality - expectations we need to balance these we can’t want more or aim too low so we need to create both aspirations and goals. Create good enough and ambitious goal so we’re not miserable. 
  * Balance anxiety by recalling the excitement and potential benefits
  * I’m not biased blind spot we see others as biased but us as objective and the smarter we are the harder it is to see us as objective. More likely to drink our own cool aid must be more careful. Don’t be ignorant of your ignorance
  * Market expertise isn’t about knowledge but synthesis because we have all the info.

  Chris Williamson
  In advance of a project happening, the concern that it's not going to go well. Okay. Give me an upcoming project that you're worried about right now. Three and a half thousand people on stage in London in a week and a half's time. Perfect. Okay. So what are you afraid of specifically? Looking silly, not performing well, thinking less of myself because things don't go well, damaging my credibility, proving critics right, not proving myself right.
  Adam Grant
  Huh, that's a pretty solid list of fears. Maybe you shouldn't do the talk.
  Chris Williamson
  I've sold the tickets. I can't not do that. Why did you agree to do it in the first place? Because it's exciting and thrilling and something that in retrospect, I'll be proud that I did.
  Adam Grant
  Okay. And let me ask you a couple other questions just to understand your perspective a little bit more. How often have the fears that you have come true? Very rarely. When they have, what's different about those events? Hmm.
  Chris Williamson
  I probably haven't prepared fully, or there was some unseen factor that kind of came out of nowhere. I was underslept. I was in a bad mood. I was stressed about something. Typically, the lovely, flat, clear water that I was supposed to be performing in got disrupted.
  Adam Grant
  There we go. All right. So I think there's a ton of material to work with here. I think the first thing you could do is you could say, okay, there are things that could go wrong, but there are also things that could go right. Let's not forget that. And I think asking, why did I commit to this? You had a clear answer to that, right? It's exciting. It's thrilling. There's some upside for you, presumably, in connecting with your audience and also connecting with a new audience and creating more opportunities for you to get your ideas out there. I think that's got to be balanced. So that's one option for emotion regulation is, okay, when you're feeling anxiety, it's a sign that you care about something that is beyond your control. And let's talk about then what the things are that you can control. And so you then went to preparation. And so you are potentially a defensive pessimist, somebody who worries about the worst case scenario, and then harnesses that anxiety as motivation to prepare, which is why I think We have to remember, we don't want you to be in a great mood for the next week and a half before you get on stage, because that might actually quell your anxiety prematurely. And then you get complacent and you don't do the preparation necessary. And then you're more likely to disappoint yourself or others. And then I think the last thing here is let's get some psychological distance and ask yourself, okay, you've been in this situation before. What is the base rate of failure? It's actually pretty low. That means you're fairly good at this, and you're also mostly prepared. And so that's a reason to be confident that you're capable of controlling enough to have a high probability of success. So I guess those are the range of emotion regulation strategies I would try here. Which ones resonate with you? Which ones are more of a struggle for you?
  Chris Williamson
  I don't actually think that I'm that driven by the fear of failure to go and do the preparation. Maybe that was it in the beginning. And this sort of goes back to what you were talking about before that people may need compliments at the start of their journey, but criticisms are more salient the further down that They get. I think that a lot of people are driven, they're activated by this need to prove themselves, to prove their fears wrong. But after a while, at least for me, you're just so balls deep in these habits and routines and the way that you see the world. And this is how I show up. And this is what my day looks like. And this is how I prepare and so on and so forth. So I actually think that that as a fuel is something that largely has sort of been let go of for me. Even if some of the fears still persist, the motivation to fix the things that will stop the fears, I think has changed a little. That makes sense.
  Adam Grant
  And so then I think what drives you is wanting to live up to your own standards and wanting to make sure that you don't fall short of other people's expectations of you. ([Time 0:41:59](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3dd32aec-3d27-49cc-9c6a-5fdf5cd4bbbb))
- **From Information Retrieval to Synthesis**
  - We've shifted from information scarcity to abundance.
  - The ability to synthesize information and connect dots is now more valuable than simply collecting it.
  Transcript:
  Chris Williamson
  Squirrels have this weird sort of inventory in their mind where they say, well, I've reached a point where each unit of time in this tree is diminishing in terms of its nut return. And that tree, based on its distance and my estimated number of nuts in that tree, is this amount. And then eventually it breaches the threshold and it moves from one tree to the next tree. Typical squirrel cognition, by the way. Right. Okay. Classic squirrel cognition. And I think that humans are the same. Information foragers, you know, always on the lookout. I need to find more things. Wouldn't this be interesting? Wouldn't this be interesting? Especially if you're sort of curiously driven. And then we enter into this world where we're at a permanent 24-hour buffet that extends into eternity in all directions and we can essentially never leave. And yes, for a long time, we were information scavengers and scourers. And now it's much more about being discerning. It's about what do I need to take from this? And how does it tie into my bigger web of things? Because if you just take whatever you can get and permanently do that, you're just going to be distracted, distracted, distracted.
  Adam Grant
  That's profound. That is modern wisdom personified. I think you've nailed it. And Chris, I think you're right. There was a really limited period of time where optimal information was available. And now that that is clearly behind us, I think our ability to set boundaries on what we consume, right? I think to raise our attentional filters and block out information that is actually redundant or overwhelming or poor quality, that is a vital skill. I think that filtering out is actually in some ways more important than taking in. So my colleague Dan Leventhal writes a lot about absorptive capacity, which is a person or an organization's capability to take in new information. And I think we're all now drowning in information. And I want to know how finely tuned is your filter to know what to ignore and what to avoid. There's actually now a body of research on what's called critical ignoring, which is do you have the discernment like you're talking about to know what to immediately not pay attention To or discount or dismiss. And we have to do that faster and faster now as we're bombarded with more information. And then I think the other skill here, just to build on the synthesis point, Dan Pink wrote about this. I think his most prescient book was A Whole New Mind, which is now two decades ago, where he argued that in a left-brain world, right-brainers were actually going to dominate the future. And he named a particular right brain scale that I think now there's a premium on, which he called symphony. And it's, you know, it's the ability to take a bunch of different musical notes and arrange them into, you know, a harmony or a melody and a, you know, a pleasing, you know, I shouldn't Even do this metaphor because I'm completely clueless about music. But that idea of symphony is something now that gets rewarded in a big way, right? Can you not only cut through all the noise, but then, you know, zoom in on what's really important and connect those dots in a way that other people can, you know, can understand. And I think that, you know, maybe this is just a variation on your scavenger forager analogy, but I think that it used to be the dot collectors who were rewarded. The more stuff you knew, the more impressive you were, and people saw that as a mark of expertise. And now it's the dot connectors who are going to rule the world because they can spot the patterns that are invisible to others and then anticipate those. And I think that means you have to see the problems in order to solve them. And in order to see the problems in a complex world, you have to connect dots and synthesize. Yeah. Yeah.
  Chris Williamson
  It's a very odd scenario to be in, in such a short space of time for the primary driving advantage that we were supposed to rely on to have been flipped from one thing to another thing. And, uh, you know, it doesn't surprise me that people are struggling with their attention, that they're distracted a lot of the time, that they feel frustrated at the fact that they Can't hold on to things. You go for the first time in human history, we are swimming in an abundance of information. We're swimming in an abundance of food, of sloth, of anything you want to have an abundance of, you can have it apart from like peace. And yeah, it doesn't surprise me. It doesn't surprise me. Adaptively, we're not built for it. And culturally, in terms of archetypes, we don't have any tools to be able to use.
  Adam Grant
  Well, this is fascinating. And in some ways, it takes us full circle to the beginning of our conversation because a lot of people are, I would say, fretting that our struggles with attention are a problem of ability. I hear people say all the time, I can't focus. Kids do not have the capacity to pay attention anymore like they used to. Well, guess what? There was a meta-analysis that came out this year looking at every study that's been done over several decades where both kids and adults are tested on attention. And it turns out that kids are no worse than they were 10 and 20 and 30 years ago, and adults are actually better. So we have not lost the ability to pay attention. What I think is in short supply is the motivation to pay attention. To your point, when there are a million distractions, you're not going to focus on any one thing for a long period of time. Like, why would you read a whole book when there are lots of interesting articles on the internet? But when you find something that grabs your attention or piques your interest, your capacity to hold it has not been diminished.

- **Maintaining Groundedness**
  * Maintain relationships with people who value you for your character, not just your achievements.
  * Friends from childhood or those unfamiliar with your career can offer this grounding perspective. Reason why you can be happy 
  * In knowledge working and life it can always feel like if we’re not suffering we don’t deserve success and there will always be another hill but true happiness comes when we have strong relationships that focus on who we are as people not what we achieve and also makes us feel full in a way the hedonic treadmill of constant success can’t true friends give us the ability to feel happy loved and successful.
  Transcript:
  Chris Williamson
  And a lot of the questions, you know, the most common questions, how do I know that the thing that I'm doing is the right thing? The path that I'm on is the right one. I struggle to feel motivated because the people around me aren't into the things that I'm into. And it makes me feel lonely and broken. And I don't know if I'm going to end up finding a tribe that's into the new stuff. And I'm tempted to go back to the old life. And then the third one, no matter how hard I work, I really struggle to ever give myself enough credit for a job well done.
  Adam Grant
  Yeah. I mean, this is a perpetual struggle. It seems to be especially pronounced in knowledge work where people feel like my work is never done. Like when have I done enough? And I think, yeah, I guess I'd say a couple of things on this. The first one is my all-time favorite experimental history piece is the article Adam wrote on how there's a place for everyone on how to find your niche. I think it's a must-read. Secondly, when have I done it enough? How do I know I've made it? I think there there's, there's sort of an endless, like, well, let me, let me, let me try to characterize this with a, with a little bit of an analogy, which is, I think, and I'm, I don't Know if this is going to land or not, but you can be the judge. I see this a ton with my students. I see them, they get into Wharton and they now are going to have an Ivy League degree to carry with them their whole lives. And what that means is every time they meet somebody who finds out where they went to college, that person is going to assume they're smart or they're motivated or both. And that could be enough, but pretty soon, like they start to worry about having the most prestigious job and they think they have to work for McKinsey or Goldman Sachs. And if they don't get one of those jobs, they have failed. And so then they take one of those jobs. And then the question is, but did I make partner? Like, have I been promoted to managing director? And the question that I ask them is, how many of those will you have to achieve? How many of those badges of honor, those merit badges, will you need on your resume before you conclude that other people are going to be impressed by you? How many times are you going to be seduced by the status of the next opportunity to say, well, I've got to suffer in order to reach that next peak? And at some point, you're going to decide either I've done enough or it's no longer worth it. And what I want to know is how do you get to that point sooner? So I had a really interesting conversation once with the author, Michael Lewis, of Moneyball and The Blind Side and The Big Short. And I asked him, I said, Michael, you've spent your whole career studying people who achieve extraordinary success. Which ones are grounded? Which ones know how to appreciate the distance they've traveled? And he said, I don't see a lot of humility in the worlds that I occupy. He said, but the people who stay grounded, they have one thing in common. They all have friends from when they're 10 years old. And I don't know whether that's causal, right? Maybe just the kinds of people who are inclined to be grounded are the ones who keep their friends. But I've got to believe, Chris, that there is a component of this that sort of keeps you human and also makes you realize like you are pushing yourself too hard and you don't need to suffer In these ways, which is your friends from 10 years old, they don't value you by your achievements. They don't define your worth by your success. Your relationship predates all of that nonsense. And so I think those are the best people to keep you honest. And I don't think it has to be your friends from when you were 10. I think it could be your friends from when you were eight. It could be your friends from when you were 14. It might be people you've met who actually don't know anything about your career or your accomplishments or your goals and aspirations. And I think we all need those people in our lives who value us for our character, not for our success.

  Yeah, I think your mom is probably usually a good place to look as well. What does your mom want for you in life? Wants you to be content and happy and she loved you whether you were number one or it didn't matter to. So maybe, maybe, I mean, yeah, that tyrannical tiger mom that wants you to be. Yeah, it's true. Good point.

  Well, no, I was going to say that that is more common than I would have believed. There was a, there's a making caring comments study where you ask parents what they want most for their kids. And most parents say, I want my kid to be happy and kind. Then you ask their children, what do your parents want for you? And their kids think that achievement is number one, that their success matters more to their parents than their happiness or their kindness. And I think, I don't believe, by the way, that the kids are right per se or the parents are right. I think that what happens is parents want all these things. We want our kids to be successful and happy and kind. And we think that if they're successful, they're ([Time 1:06:11](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f626dfaa-6333-4e60-9657-1f5a01448804))
