  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  We're lso going to see t with scaffier, and ritz richard found himself consumed with anxiety, the deep and exssential kind that accompanies great risk, undertaken in public. He had put it all on the line for this hotel, his money, his friends, his friend's money and his reputation.
  Speaker 1
  He had spent five years building the hotel, and now this was the moment of truth. And that moment of truth, it's the grand opening, before i get into that, and everything writs notices. That's whar writsis on the train. That's where he's headed to.
  Speaker 2
  Now he says, there's, there's an interesting thing, just a few sentence here for you, that's really fascinating.
  Speaker 1
  And it's an element to human nature that never changes. What's important for us to understand.
  Speaker 2
  There's a lot of this is one of the first s in london to have electricity, to have light bulbs and to have elevators.
  Speaker 1
  And his customers are scared. Humans are always scared of the new. And now, you know, a hundred, 20 years, hundred, forty years later, we're like this. You're scared of an elevator or a light bulb? Wernt you crazy?
  Speaker 2
  But they thought they they were like little bombs.
  Speaker 1
  They would explode. And so i'm going to read this section to you then an goin to tell you another thing that i leaned from steve jobs that's a very, very powerful idea for you.
  Speaker 2
  Richard understood that he needed to educate his clients actualy.
  Speaker 1
  This is about the theatre, not the hotel. But the ho tel does have elevators.
  Speaker 2
  U as the first theatre in london, his was the first theatre in london to be lit entirely by electricity, a fact that aroused much curiosity, but also fear.
  Speaker 1
  So s customers are asking, how is it safe?
  Speaker 2
  Just how flammable exactly was a light bulb?
  Speaker 1
  And so he has to do public demonstrations and show that, you know, it's not flammable. Everything's ok. You're not going to the theatre. 's not going to burst in the frame to he flames. Something that i heard steve jobb say one time. That thing is a very prowpl idea. And he talks about what is marketing, what is advertising? And you can wrap this up in in public relations rad he says, good p r educates people.
  Speaker 2
  That's all it is.
  Speaker 1
  That's his exact quote. Good p r educates people, that's all it is. More on richard thinking not only how he designed his theatre, but also a how he designed his hotel, whichis he does something really smart here.
  Speaker 2
  Again, ie sharp, founder four seasons, did the exact same thing.
  Speaker 1
  If something annoys you it there's a good chance it annoys your customers too. So by eliminating that, you actually build a better experience for your customers. This leads to, hopefully, more success in your business, right?
  Speaker 2
  Just as he had at the theatre, richard planned to eliminate all the extraon, extroneous charges at the hotel, aiming for a smoother and less irritating service. No charge for baths, lights or attendance.
  Speaker 1
  Announce a full page advertisement for the hotel.
  Speaker 2
  Such charges for basic service as this is so important, right? Because everybody else, humans don't think we copy righte to everybody else. U jus, i goal other hotels, they charge for the stuff. So i'll bild a hotel and i'll do the same thing. But you can make vast levels of improvement by just bucking the train and asking, youse, does this action y make sense? And most people never askd a question. Such charges for basic services were common at most hotels and infuriated him endlessly. This was so common that there was a very um there's a very common book that was called, that was written at the time. ([Time 0:12:35](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7e385b5e-b002-4609-95db-36d7ceec2702))
    - **Note:** Good pr educates people. Richard who was Ritz backer realized people were scared of new change as the first theater to have electric he did safety demonstrations. People fear new. Delight your customers there were these exploitative fees at English hotels that everyone hated so much they wrote books about them. Ritzs hated these and got rid of them to help UX. Disrupt industries with second class products don’t follow trend buck the trend and have unique differentiation. We sell the results of our failures. Trial and experimentation has failure as a feature not a bug. Keep pushing don’t stop. Ritz goes to London because it’s the center of the world and sees everything through his critical eye. Service was slow going slow is expensive go fast speed is vital. Ritz sees the partnership with escofier as partners they’re both well known and famous true partners. Ritz knew the food was good but he brought in escofier because he needed great.

  Key takeaways:
  - Ritz and Scafe had a partnership and friendship that lasted their entire lives
  - Scafe was a brilliant chef who dazzled guests with his cooking and wrote a famous culinary book
  - Ritz observed the flaws at the Savoy hotel and offered advice politely as a consultant
  - Ritz wanted the independence of being a hotel owner and did not regret turning down the job at the Savoy
  - Ritz's desire for independence and confidence in his own success were reinforced by seeing wealth in London
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Ritz is technicallye like the senior partner, but that he doesn't, they both have control of their domains, and they have a partnership and a friendship that lasts their entire lives.
  Speaker 1
  Ah, which is also rare with two headstrong, really successful people.
  Speaker 2
  He had built his success at the hotel busines santana with the brilliant chef august scafier, at the grand hotel monte carlo, in the grand hotel national in lucerne, where they had both
  Speaker 1
  Worked for years, if scafier had dazzled, this is also my favorite part of these books ti were reading, ause thy're both super well known, superfamous. But we know them at the end of their careers, right?
  Speaker 2
  This is when they're ther thirties. They're not yet. I mean, the they're showing signs of who they become. They haven't become those people yet. This is my favorite part of studying the lives.
  Speaker 1
  Like who i go back to a thing was like episode number one, forty something tat that book on bill gates. Ye, maybe i listn to bill gates talk now when he's 65, 70. Okot be wrong, but that's the bill gates in that book that i did.
  Speaker 2
  It's called harddrivei covers the first 35 years of his life.
  Speaker 1
  That is the bill gates. That t the success that the bill gates of to day enjoys these that's, that's the most relatable part. It's very hard to relate to a multi billionaire. It's at the end of their career. Most of us are still on the way up right?
  Speaker 2
  So we want to learn what the great people did when they were on their way up right?
  Speaker 1
  And this is where i have a big smile on fijus, thinking about like you have caesar writs in august scafe, before they werewrits in the scafe, working together. They had to put in the work before.
  Speaker 2
  And we see that because somebody wrote down these lessons in a book. How amazing is that? Amscafie, oh, that just gets him excited.
  Speaker 1
  Oka they had both worked there for years. Ascafe had dazzled guests with his cooking, inventing new dishes and finding new ways of presenting classics. That's a key right there.
  Speaker 2
  He takes, he understands the fundamentals, and then builds on top of them.
  Speaker 1
  And he writes one of the most famous culinary books.
  Speaker 2
  It still halfar not a half a century, over a century ter, still in print to day, still used to day. That's how how valuable his ideas were.
  Speaker 1
  And it's the fact that people were ignorant of what came before them. That's also what david olgervy talked about.
  Speaker 2
  He said that people that don't study history are ignorant amateurs. He did not mince words about that.
  Speaker 1
  M so ascafi says the same i itself. But again, think about that as his main theme, understand the fundamentals and then build on top of that. So he'd find new ways of presenting classic classics. Often thought that his scafier, in fact, was the key to his own success. The savoys chef was not on the same level. And so ritz sees what's going on, but he also plays it close to his vestment, for he's not an owner in the hotel. He's not accepting a job. He's a consultant, so he's observing, but he's not going to run over the people that alrady working there. He was not there to direct and organize the staff, but to offer advice, which he did politely.
  Speaker 2
  He could see every flaw how to fix them.
  Speaker 1
  Again, he is an obsessive and again, when we get to the end, you'll see his life does have a sad ending because of his obsessive nature. Unfortunately, sometimes our strength, our greatest strength, can be our greatest weaknesses. We have to be careful.
  Speaker 2
  Richard had told ritz proudly that it was his wife, helen, who had taken charge of the decorps.
  Speaker 1
  So writz held his tongue. Ritz did not like the decorps. When ritz is going to wind up takin mo over the hotel later, after a lot of consternation, months of being recruited and saying no. And he gets rid of that, and that causes an issue. Remember, he gets fired by richard later on.
  Speaker 2
  That's how we started the bodcassim, not bearing the lead there. Very important. All these things are very important, because it's going to lead him to his greatest success, which is also an exciting thought. There was no point in antagonizing helen with his views on the hotel design, so he didn't. It's very smart move there. And anyway, the real problems were deeper. Alone in his room, at the end of his twoe day, ritz contemplated the savoy's future. It will not succeed, he thought, not under its present management.
  Speaker 1
  And even at the nd of two weeks, he's still not accepting the job. He wanted the independence of the anch pener. Same thing about when you read biography of thomas edison, one of the first things, opening paragraphs in that book the wizard of menlow park. He just wanted the autonomy of unch paner, a small shop where he can work on his own ideas. He didn't have these grand ambitions. I mean, he wanted o in went have succeeded on a grand scale, but because i just want to have control over what i work on, and then let me pick my ideas of my own time and and make my own money. Ritz is the same thing. Have worked for people for 25 years. I finallybought my independence.
  Speaker 2
  I don't want to give it up now. B ritz had no regrets about turning down the job.
  Speaker 1
  Ritz had spent years, i just ran oer my own point here.
  Speaker 2
  Ritz had spent years working for others, and was now finally a hotel owner himself. Yes, this hotel were small, but they were his.
  Speaker 1
  And seeing the wealth in london only reinforced his desire for independence and his confidence in his own success, s e ging to go more in ta background of writs here, this is hilarious Because itssthous persons, a ridiculous person a says sas to him. I'll get te in a minute, but, um, let me give some background. And again, a large part that's gong to be surprising is this idea of impostor sinrom that in moments, which most people don't share with other peopleis thak, they don't think they're Good enough. ([Time 0:22:47](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9f26b50a-992d-4795-a972-f76b799e2a2a))
    - **Note:** Understand what comes before you escofier understood the first principles deeply and then figured out how to properly transcend them and break the rules. Ritz is an obsessive and this is his best and worst quality. Don’t be ignorant amateur. Good mind constantly works on improving things mentally can’t stop it but you need to turn it off lest it kills you. Ritz turns down the job at the savoy he needed ownership and agency over everything. Imposter syndrome and intense doubt is normal. Don’t let machine govern you Jay Gould. His boss at his first hotel told Ritz he didn’t get it. Sam Walton was told the same thing about retail and built an empire. Don’t shit on peoples hopes and dreams just keep running you can do anything. Belief from others is vital and encouragement and drives people through many failures. Ritz wife was his best friend a muse importance of good relationships and attachment. Ritz turned down the savoy saw the management was bad wanted his independence but eventually the draw became too big for greatness and he got back in the ring.

  Mark an dreson said it best when he was telling an audience why he spent so much time reading biographies. He said, there are thousands of years of history in which lots and lots of very smart people worked very hard and ran all types of experiments on how to create new businesses and invent New technology. They ran these experiments throughout their entire lives. At some point somebody put these lessons down in a book. For very little money and a few hours of time, you can learn from some one's accumulated experience. There is so much more to learn from the past than we often realize. ([Time 0:35:26](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e5060a42-f088-4a34-8340-5ba8363262ee))
    - **Note:** Ritzs and escoffier both grew up poor with a chip on their shoulder and formed and amazing partnership. Realizes he needs this partnership they’re both deep into understanding every customer and personalized service escofier did the same never serving someone the same meal twice. Elite French chef. Escofier completely reshaped hotel kitchens from the ground up that had been that way for hundreds of years. The two were great friends and partners. He hated the obvious flaws from being a kid saw cooking as science and art. He created the professional kitchen by reduction he cut out drinking on the job and yelling. Many people saw the issues but he was the first person to actually do something. He even made people come with clean uniforms. If yiu do all the little things right the score takes care of itself. He was very strict but protective making men clean their aprons and wear coats and not drink built a culture. His food like management was reductionary not additive. Wanted to perfect the escense. Above all keep it simple. Kept in depth notes on all customers to give them what they want. He dreamed of being a sculptor but couldn’t so he brought the artist mindset to cooking. Bloom where you are planted. He had to be a cook so he embeddd art in his food.

  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  About to sue each other because they're fighting over who should pay for a new carpet. This is a ridiculous behavior. We should avoid Gilbert went to court to sue Richard, who would not bend on the question of expenses of the carpet. It seemed astounding that these men who had each made a fortune working together were now squabbling in public over a few hundred pounds. It was bad. It was bad for all the reputation. And it was perhaps a sign of things to come, where small grievances can conceivably cause big trouble. That's a reference to Richard. A small grievances that compound over time that lead Richard to firing a scaffier and Ritz. But we're not there yet. At this point Ritz is his schedule is unbelievably full. He's running the Savoy half the year. He's running his businesses. He's consulting because he's now becoming the greatest hotel here in Europe. So he's consulting for other projects and it says this feeling might be familiar to you. That's why I'm reading it. Ritz had never been happier. He had also been never been more frantic. He was managing three hotels, two restaurants, and three countries. A recipe for always needing to be somewhere else. That kind of echoes something I learned from Jeff Bezos, where he said depression usually comes from inaction. Usually he's not coming from being overworked, but actually underworked. I thought it was a really interesting insight. Let's go into more detail about a scaffier's level of detail that he applies to everything. A scaffier wrote his own ([Time 0:46:35](https://share.snipd.com/snip/658e73b3-abb7-4048-a68a-b44ed229bb79))

      He was cheating under the table and got fired be honest have integrity.

      Escofier integrated his life and passion by bringing art into the kitchen.
      Ritz had an insane work ethic and attention to detail but terrible imposter syndrome ignore sunk costs own the customer relationship
- The Strangest Thing Happened
  Summary:
  A concise, short, entertaining and engaging summary is required
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  There was a dearth of great hotels around the world, be it said. Why, with the right backing, a man of Ritz's quality could open a luxury hotel in every capital in Europe. And London too. Yes, London could always use another luxury hotel. And so what if that meant competing with the Savoy? And so Ritz partners up with this guy, one of the richest guys in the world. They started this thing called the Ritz Hotel Syndicate. They start getting investors to back them and he's going to start building his own hotels. You could imagine from Ritz's perspective, it's like wait, and Ritz is taking his meetings at the Savoy. There's issues with putting these dinners that benefit the Ritz Hotel Syndicate on the house of the Savoy that from Richard, you know, is the last straw. That's why he fires Ritz as well. I mean, also, you know, he's not going to like the fact that this guy is supposed to be his employee. And now he's setting up and you're going to be building, even though it's in his contract, that he's going to be building at these hotels and his interest is going to be elsewhere. But again, it's going to be inevitable when you have somebody as talented as an ambition, as Ritz. So something that sparks this whole thing is somebody snitches. So Richard's wife, Helen, who's also his partner, gets an anonymous note. And it says that's when the strangest thing happened. Strangest thing happened. A few weeks later, Helen received an anonymous note. The note was not addressed ([Time 1:00:25](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0b356809-7859-4a5d-a9bc-04850afd016d))
    - **Note:** Ritz starts competing with the savoy as well this leads to him getting fired. He did come stady stuff to get fired. He was always the poor farmer. Goes to open the ritz in Paris. He was hesitant about using his name but it’s a brand not just a name. Brand is a promise. Ideas are immortal escofier pioneers the cookbook. The savoy did an audit and discovered the mid dealings. They are stealing and they get fired but this allows them to go out on their own. The prince of wales refused to go to the savoy where Ritz goes he owns the customer relationship which gave him the power to go out on his own. Ritz wanted to make the hotel room feel like an old townhouse. He wanted quality and perfection above all. Escofier likewise is pioneering the cook book. Escofier wrote more than a book but his business philosophy his first principles what he had pioneered and his own story. Biographies are downloading philosophy. Escofier broke things down and simplified the process of cooking to make it more perfect. The ritz hotel was his baby. He was so detail oriented and went extra anal for this anticipating customer problems before they did. This was manic obsessiveness mixed with doubting himself and a need to win. Invents problems not discussed to detail oriented nature.
- The Hotel Ritz
  Summary:
  A concise, short, entertaining and engaging summary was generated.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Say. This was a constant refrain. He was so full of energy and ambition, yet also prone to melancholy. And then he starts doubting himself. He's telling her. And what have I accomplished? Nothing. That's a ridiculous statement. He's not that he's not being rational there. There would be there would be no doubt when he was done, just what he had accomplished. The hotel Ritz would bear his name for a reason. She's paying attention to a little small detail. When you pay attention to the little small details, you can invent solutions to problems that are never even discussed. Talks about he noticed women didn't know where to put their purses. So he winds up putting these little hooks first hotel and restaurant to put the little hooks where women can put their purses. Again, a tiny detail solution to a problem no one even put into words. But one that Ritz in his obsessive way had noted and now acted upon. It had always been his philosophy repeatedly explained to all his employees to anticipate guests wishes before the guests did. Now, as he was designing his own hotel, that carefully intuitive sort of thinking informed every decision. Ritz was always pleased, but never satisfied. So going back to Scott FEA, he's very, very deep into this project. And this was interesting. He innovates, but he knows that time is the best filter. As Scott FEA designed the kitchens at the hotel Ritz exactly the way he wanted them. It was the first time he controlled every aspect of his workspace and equipment from the placement of the ovens ([Time 1:11:52](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2f7e2db9-552f-4e3a-a2c6-d58c888702e2))
    - **Note:** Time is the best filter escofier knew when fi innocaye and when he opted to use the traditional ideas. Innovates but good cooking is rooted in tradition and quality. He didn’t use the new chewier cookware from the us but kept it traditional. Control your mind it plays tricks on you. Were the sum of all our experiences and you get better/ compound as you get older. Ritz collapeses at 53 and never truely recovered because he pushed himself too hard and had a nervous breakdown. They decided to licsence the name and escofier retired to franchise but Ritz had entered the lexicon for class.
