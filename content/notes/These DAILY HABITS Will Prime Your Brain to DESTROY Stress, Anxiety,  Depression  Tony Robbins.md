### Highlights

- The Five to Thrive Method
  Key takeaways:
  - Depression and excitement are related to how a person uses their body, and how they focus on their problems.
  - Changing one's biochemistry can help to improve mood, but it is only one part of the solution.
  - Creating a compelling future is essential in overcoming depression.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  $20 billion did some of the most interesting studies in the world, and we didn't move one person out of depression. The bottom line is, biochemistry is part of it, but it is related to what we focus on and what we feel. I can change your biochemistry in a heartbeat. Close your eyes, and have you imagine one thing I can disrupt? You put produce fear, close your eyes, produce something else? We can produce a parasympathetic effect, a calming effect. So you cannot separate the mind and the body together. And so my approach is both. I think you know from going to events. I believe in physiology first, but it isn't just biochemical. It's the way you move. It's the way you breathe. It's the way you gesture. If I said to you, there's the depressed person behind Curtain number one over here, and I'll give you a $100,000 donation to your favorite charity if you can describe their posture. Everyone knows what's their posture like. Where's their head? Down.
  Speaker 4
  Down.
  Speaker 1
  Where's the shoulders? Slouch. Are they breathing full or shallow? Shallow. That's right. Are they talking loud or quiet? Soft. Fast or slow? Slow.
  Speaker 4
  How do you know?
  Speaker 1
  Because we've all practiced the shit at some point in the depressed, right? But if you take that same person, I don't care what's going on with them, and you put their shoulders back. I know the sounds absurd, and you have them breathe different, and they speak at a different tempo, and they move. Their biochemistry changes like that. So, you've got to shift the way the body's been used, but then also, you have to create a compelling future. This is the way I look at it. I look at it as five to thrive, and give you a little picture in your head. Think of a triangle, the first base of three things. The base of how you use your body affects your depression or your excitement. If someone's depressed or they're excited, they use the body differently. They breathe differently, they move differently, they speak differently. So, you can make a biochemical change just by changing the body radically enough in the way you move. The second is what you focus on to determine what you feel. So, if you're supposed to meet your husband or wife at 7 p.m. For dinner, and you get there and they're not there, boyfriend, girlfriend, whoever, what do you feel? Well, some people go, I'm angry. Some people go, I'm worried. Well, it's only seven. Well, say it's 7.30, and they've not shown up. They've not called. They not text. Well, now, some people go, I'm really worried. I'm really pissed off. You know, it's 8.30, they haven't called. You know, I'm full. Woman tells me, right? I didn't wait for the basket. But my point is whether you're angry or whether you're worried, those are biochemical effects, but they're all based on what you focused on. If you were really angry, like they did it again, you know, they're probably screwing out with somebody else. If you imagine that in your mind, you're going to be upset. But if you're worried, you thought, what if they're on a car accident? You're going to get a very different biochemical effect. But people have habits of what they focus on. And those habits become your biochemical habits as well. And so, they reinforce each other. It's not a one-way street. So that's why, you know, I really believe exercise is one of the most important elements, pushing someone beyond their normal comfort zones physiologically, while you're simultaneously working on their head, creating something. So you need strong physiology and you're really clear focus because you're only experiencing what you focus on. The human brain is a distortion, deletion, and generalization device. Your conscious mind can only handle so many things at once. You're not thinking about your clothing touching your skin or, you know, the sound of your heartbeat till I mention it. Or let's say the, you know, the sound of the in your ear of being able to hear that heartbeat. All those things I have to call your attention to. Because your brain is deleting most of what's going on, so it's not overwhelmed consciously. So we pay attention to a small amount of things. So if you're really happy, you're deleting all the things that could piss you off or make you worried. If you're really worried, you're deleting all the things you could be grateful or happy about. So, and we tend to generalize our lives because we're cognitive risers. We don't want to think things through. So if you have strong physiology, strong focus, and the third piece is, meaning is what creates emotion. Like if somebody does something and you go, they're disrespecting me, or they're challenging me, or they're coaching me, or they're loving me. Well, whichever word you select for those sensations in your body, your biochemistry becomes. And so, you know, somebody might say, oh, you know, this happened to me because God's punishing me, or this happened to me because God's challenging me, or there's problems here, because it's a gift from God, or someone else says it has nothing to do with God. It's the fact that I've been a lazy bastard, right? Whatever it is you do in your head, there is a biochemical effect. So there's the body, there's the focus, and there's language. Those three shape how you feel moment to moment. If you're excited right now, using your body, your focus, and your language in a different way, than if you're pissed off, and if you're worried, etc. But then what makes you use these three once you understand them is you need what's called the compelling future. You need something that gets you to move forward. And like, I feel so bad for the generation today, you know, the Z generation millennials, because so many of them are now talking about not even having children, because of the exaggeration of the problems. We've always had problems. I remember we were going to run out of oil where the ozone was going to be destroyed in the 1970s, the cover of Time Magazine. We've always had these challenges, and we've always learned to adapt to these challenges, whatever those challenges may be. But people today think these problems are forever, because we've had some times here that we've never had, where we literally shut down the whole world and had people trapped in their homes, and that has an effect on people because they don't have a compelling future. So you have to develop a compelling future. And what allows you to do that finally is what's under this triangle, if there's a circle, think of a compelling future, and there's the power of identity. Identity is, who are you beyond the problem? There's something inside you that's bigger than anything that's ever happened to you, that ever could happen to you. And tapping in and finding that part of yourself is how you get someone to have sustained strength. So you have the reason to do it, a compelling future, something they're going for. And it's got to be a compelling future about more than just getting by. That's not compelling, or surviving, or doing okay. You know, the secret to anyone who succeeded is they found something they care about more than themselves. Something that has meaning for them that they want to serve more than themselves, because as human beings, if you get in your head, you're dead. Almost all of us can find something to be upset about. That's the nature of the mind. The mind is constantly dissecting things, separating, comparing. But when you look at back and you take a look at somebody's life, and you look at the totalitarian aspect of, what am I here to serve? What am I here to give? What am I being called to for life? Those are the people that were in concentration camps and survived. You know, if you read Man's Search for Meaning, Victor Frankel, one of my favorite people on Earth, this entire piece was they had ...

    - **Note:** Your physical body has a big effect on how you feel. If your body language is bad it’s feeding your depression. You also need to look forward to something this hope is vital in life. We can always find something we’re always able to find something we can be unhappy with but what can we focus on so we can choose happiness. Identity and compelling future shape peoples lives. We learn through total immersion. Drowning in information but starved for wisdom.
