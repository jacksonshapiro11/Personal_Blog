### Highlights

- I’ll tell you the takeaway: If you’re used to being assisted, supervised, mandated, or dictated, and then suddenly you experience the glory of independence, the feeling is sensational. **Doing something on your own terms can feel better than doing the exact same thing when someone else is peering over your shoulder, telling you what to do, guiding you along**.
  And that’s as true for adults as it is for kids getting ice cream.
  Independence is the best financial goal for most people. But independence is more than just financial – moral, cultural, and intellectual independence – is one of the highest levels you can reach in life. “There is only one success,” says poet Christopher Morley, “to be able to spend your life in your own way.”
  Derek Sivers once put it a different way:
  > All misery comes from dependency. If you weren’t dependent on income, people, or technology, you would be truly free. The only way to be deeply happy is to break all dependencies.
  That’s why independence – financially, intellectually, morally – is one of the highest goals you can achieve. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jp8g00dhw1b5v5b5k17jexhb))
    - **Note:** Optimize for independence being able to do the same thing in a more independent way is the key to happiness
