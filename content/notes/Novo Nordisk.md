### Highlights

- Episode AI notes
  1. In 1923, Marie Crow, H.C. Haggadorn, and August Conchstead partnered together to produce insulin at the Lion Chemical Factory in Copenhagen, successfully completing trials with eight human patients. Haggadorn resigned his medical post to focus on the project full time.
  2. Novo emerged as a successful pharmaceutical company with MC insulin as their highly regarded product, while Nordisk faced challenges and became a much smaller company. Novo decided to diversify into the enzyme business, but it proved to be capital intensive and unprofitable.
  3. Novo approached rival Nordisk for a merger in the 1970s, but it didn't happen until 15 years later. The new CEO of Nordisk, Henry Brenham, rejected Novo's offer but saw an opportunity in the new MC insulin generation.
  4. Novo Nordisk, a leader in insulin production, has never had a viable oral anti-diabetic drug. Research led them to discover that increasing the hormone GLP one in type two diabetes patients could stabilize insulin production. However, genetically engineering more GLP one proved to be complicated, leading to the suggestion of consuming GLP one directly as an unconventional approach.

  Speaker 2
  I talked to some Danish folks in research for this episode. Thank you very much. And I just, I realized in those conversations, I need to give up on trying to pronounce things correctly.
  Speaker 3
  Stick to French.
  Speaker 2
  Stick to French. Yes. But that translates to English as the Lion Chemical Factory. And it is owned and run by another man named August. August Conchstead with a K-O-N-G-S-T-E-D. And so they partner together. And by the summer of 1923, the very same summer that the Nobel Committee is debating on the award for that year. And of course, Crow at this point has nominated his buddy McCloud along with Fanting. By that summer of 1923, the combo of the crows and Haggadorn and the Lion Chemical Factory have produced enough insulin that they can complete trials with eight human patients with Great success there in Copenhagen. And at this point, H.C. Haggadorn, who remember was originally Marie's physician to help treat her diabetes. He resigns his medical post and decides that he's going to focus full time on this project.
  Speaker 1
  So the founders are in Haggadorn and August and Marie Crow.
  Speaker 2
  And Conchstead from the Lion Chemical Factory. These are the founders of the project, but there's no no for Nordisk yet. ([Time 0:27:31](https://share.snipd.com/snip/76628df2-31fa-4293-b34b-9c5f445e0970))
    - **Note:** This is basically just a diabetes company. Which was this death sentence in the 1910s the only way to treat was a starvation diet that starved patients so they died later. Then some people in Toronto discover insulin at this time medical breakthroughs really weren’t viewed as something to make money off of they give it to Eli Lilly to make in the us and this Nobel prize winning husband and wife visit us from Denmark she recently got diabetes they hear about the insulin innovation and bring it to Denmark on behalf of Toronto. You make stuff by crushing up pig cow or dog livers. 30k people needed 1mm dead animals. The company was set up literally as a foundation with a charitable cause. 6 months in there is a huge falling out and the the brothers who come in to do engineering and improve production leaves to start novo and this competes with nordisk down the street for 65 years before merging.
- Evolution of Novo and Nordisk post-war
  Key takeaways:
  - Novo introduced MC insulin in the 1970s, which was the first 100% pure zero antibody potential insulin
  - Novo became a scaled pharmaceutical company after the war, while Nordisk struggled with minimal production capacity
  - Novo diversified into the enzymes business, but it proved to be capital intensive and not very profitable
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  So this is basically the way things stay for the post-war era up until the 1980s. Novo follows up lent to insulin in the 1970s with MC insulin or non-immunogen monocomponent insulin, which is the first 100% pure zero antibody potential insulin. That also becomes the kind of new widely accepted best product in the market internationally. So this is the general state of play after the war. Novo is now a scaled pharmaceutical company. Nordisk is mostly in rough shape. You know, production capacity has gone down to basically zero, you know, minimal at this point in time. They have resumed the licensing business and eventually they do get back payments from all the allied countries that they were owed during the war. So you know, they're not like insolvent or anything, but they're the much, much smaller company. Now, novo, interestingly, they're now a large pharmaceutical company. They want to add a second leg of the stool, a new business line. So they get into the enzymes business. This is like laundry detergent enzymes and other industrial uses. They add that on alongside the insulin and diabetes business. And you know, that's all well and good to be a diversified, you know, industrial conglomerate, except the enzyme business is both capital intensive and not that profitable.
  Speaker 1
  Those don't mix well. ([Time 0:59:39](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e55b9102-785e-4414-ba6e-adfeba54a710))
    - **Note:** These companies go different routes nordisk focuses on liscensing tech and outsourcing manufacturing while novo makes it in house. There both innovation despite one not being a medically focused founders and novo invents liquid insulin was previously a pill that needed to be boiled then used. These companies start innovating off each other and pushing each other to create longer lasting insulin and then ww2 breaks out which kills nordisk because they get no revenue but the nazis want novo to supply all their allies with insulin so they massively ramp production in this time. This turbo charges the company’s position. The company dominates for 60 years basically
- The Potential Merger of Novo and Nordisk
  Key takeaways:
  - Novo approaches Nordisk for a merger in the 1970s.
  - Nordisk experienced a rocky succession period before the merger.
  - The new CEO of Nordisk, Henry Brenham, was previously the head of a lumber company.
  - The merger between Novo and Nordisk didn't happen for another decade and a half.
  - The new CEO, Brenham, rejected the merger and saw an opportunity in the new MC insulin generation.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Goodness if only there were such a natural partner right down the street that it might make sense. Maybe they could merge with. So here we are in the early 1970s. Novo approaches the old bitter rival Nordisk. And here's the situation. You know, this is a perfect marriage. Let's get the band back together. You know, everybody's basically dead at this point from the original days. Let's let bygones be bygones. And Nordisk, they've just gone through a pretty rocky succession period after Haggadorn retired. They're now on their third CEO in seven years. And the new CEO, Henry Brenham, he isn't from the pharma industry at all. He's not a scientist. He was previously the head of a lumber company. So this merger makes perfect sense.
  Speaker 1
  Huh, but they don't merge for another decade and a half.
  Speaker 2
  So what went wrong? It's not what happens. So instead contrary to all sort of what you would think on paper, the new CEO Brenham actually turns out to be like an amazing leader and CEO. The lumber guy. For Nordisk. The lumber guy. Huh. He is like the wartime CEO for Nordisk. He rejects novos overtures to merge. And then he goes and convinces the board, both of the operating company Nordisk and the foundation that this new MC insulin generation, which remember, novo innovated that this actually Represents a golden opportunity for Nordisk to get back in the game. ([Time 1:02:30](https://share.snipd.com/snip/bed1afa0-3b58-4ef5-972b-b0d46052854e))
    - **Note:** Novo innovated a new type of better insulin that needed to have capex build out and they are strapped for cash because they have an ancillary business bleeding cash nordisk sees this as their time to grab market share their ceo is this lumber guy but is the perfect wartime ceo. Novo wants to merge but nordisk says fuck it and goes aggressively at this new insulin building into the us too. They had 3 ceos in 7 years nordisk but this guy saw the opportunity and moved faster. They eventually merge in the 80s but they’re not very big revenue was 160mm combinded at this time as basically the near joint largest company but as people got fatter and biotech took off the company transformed they make recombinant dna that makes human insulin or at least the same chemically in a lab. It was the first biotech drug. Nordisk is compounding at 30% a year novo is struggling and making bad operating decisions and have to merge.
- Researching Oral Anti-Diabetic Drugs
  Key takeaways:
  - Novo Nordisk never had a viable oral anti-diabetic
  - Lata starts digging into academic research in the 90s
  - GLP one hormone can stabilize insulin production in type two patients
  - Genetically engineering more GLP one seemed straightforward
  - Consuming GLP one directly was not a viable option
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  And Novo doesn't have a drug in this category, despite being like the insulin leader, Novo and Novo Nordisk never had a viable oral anti-diabetic. So Lata is part of this group that's looking for new candidates. So in the early to mid 90s, Lata starts digging into the academic research. And there's new work coming out that in type two patients, a big part of the mechanism that messes with actual insulin production is a hormone called glucagon like peptide one or GLP One, Ben as you were talking about. And the thought is that if you could somehow get more GLP one into these patients bodies, you could stabilize their insulin production and thus treat the disease seems pretty straightforward. You could imagine that you could now just use the same or competent DNA techniques to genetically engineer more GLP one, just like you engineer human insulin. No big deal seems pretty straightforward.
  Speaker 1
  In fact, why don't you just go eat some GLP one just get it into your body. However you want, I'm sure it'll work out. ([Time 1:45:39](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7ebeb836-8844-47e9-a1a8-e239093aaef0))
    - **Note:** There’s this thing called GLP-1 that type 2 people need to manage their diabetes. The issue is it has a 5 minute half life. Stabilized insulin producing but can’t get the thing to stick around long enough after years the main researcher is given a 1 year ultimatum and figures out a way for a 13 hour half life and study goes forward. Type 2 diabetes don’t produce this well. Pretty much given up. Took 5 years to figure it out. They crack the nut and roll it into trials where it has this strange side effect of having people lose weight and they decide to look into this aspect more they release a diabetes focused version of the glp 1 and it’s a hit reached 1bn in sales year 1 which is like the cut off point of significance. People are asking their doctors for this and it works but not amazingly also there was a huge stigma around weight loss drugs like it was snake oil. Then they release a weight loss only drug that leads to more weight loss and it did ok but only led to 8% weight loss eventually they found the drug that led to 15% losses and that took off.
