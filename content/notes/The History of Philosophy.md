### Highlights

- Logic is the study of formal reasoning and argument. There is deduction and induction then informal logic. Deductive logic doesn’t study content but form of arguments. This is only about form not content. Induction assumes truth from limited premises. Induction can be good at guesstimating but bad at hard truths because its analogy and generalization. Fallacies of logic are bad justification leading to unsound logical statements examples are straw men, false opposites like if we don’t bomb them they’ll bomb us but there are more than 2 arguments, slippery slope fallacy, begging the question means assuming the premises in the question assume god exists because it says so in the Bible circular logic. Other examples are appeal to force do this or I’ll beat you, then the appeal to pity victims can be excused for doing things, prejudicial use of language like racism or euphemism, appealing to what others think, or no one knows the answers so there is no truth or attacking a person instead of a view the ad hominid argument. Use of red hearings over generalization of things b
- Fundamental questions of philosophy what is there what is real and then what matters. How can we know or say anything about the world? What is knowledge? How can we acquire it? then we need to understand reason, truth, and meaning which gets to logic and perception mind and consciousness. These questions are the source of metaphysics epidemiology logic and philosophy of mind. Second question about values and how to live. This is about what ultimately and deeply matters. It’s about values relationships, and the meaning of life. The good life and good society. Who we should be what matters and how we can live the best life. Things like psychology and computation, start philosophy, and then become sciences. Philosophy is the refusal to be lazy about the great questions. People can adopt viewpoints through religion, but philosophy is really about doing the hard work for yourself. Most people shy away from the obligation to think about their life.

    - **Note:** Meaning of philosophy is what is fundamentally true and how can we validate it being true and then what matters to us in our lives. What are our values. Truth seeking and life direction. Do not be lazy but intentional about the great questions.
- The point of philosophy is to help discover and answer questions around truth meaning existence and value. Ubuntu recognizing defining humanity that connects us to other humans through our humanness. Includies kindness goodness generosity compassion among other concepts of deep human connection. Interdependence of human I am because of you we need reciprocity and love. This is an active version of doing no harm or more like being a mensch. It’s between loving your neighbor and doing no harm.

    - **Note:** The point of philosophy is to understand who you are and how to live. Ubuntu is recognizing our reciprocal humanity and connecting with others on this plain. Reciprocity and love being a mensch. Active version of doing no harm through reverence of other humans.
- Confucianism everyone should act ethically in the upmost way do onto others what they’d want to do onto you. And proper ethics starts at the top of society in government and flows down. ren, the foundational virtue of Confucianism. It characterizes the bearing and behaviour that a paradigmatic human being exhibits in order to promote a flourishing human community. Created shared language and rituals. China struggles with disorder and loves order. Daoism wander along the way you can be powerful like a rock but it’s about being ok with letting water flow through you. Legalism is basically Machiavelli but in China.
    - **Tags:** #daoism, #confucionism, #golden-rule, #treat-people-better-than-they-ask/need, #legalism, #chinese-philosophy
    - **Note:** Confucianism is absolute ethics. Good philosophy for a wider crisis people look for order. Daoism let life flow through you.
- Indian philosophy. 4 noble truths life is suffering suffering arises from desire and ignorance suffering can be escaped one can achieve liberation by an ethical life and meditation. 8 fold path right vision, understanding, livelihood, effort, meditation, emotion, speech, action, and mindfulness. Achieve nirvana. Transcend desire. All schools follow path of suffering liberation through freeing yourself from desire and having good karma practicing meditation. Goal is to escape suffering through this. Balance between essential nature. Balanced life. Liberation is the realization you’re not bound to anything but you can free yourself through knowledge. You are already free you just need to realize that and not be ignorant. Don’t take life to seriously when you do you create bad desires. Mitigate desire by viewing your life from a sense of simplicity. Living for pleasure and pain in this world because it’s likely all there is so we might as well make the most and take it all in now no need to cut back or mitigate desire eat drink and be merry. This is the carvaka school of heaven because extinction happens naturally at death. This carvaka is generally the view of current people.

    - **Note:** Indian philosophy is eliminating desire. Desire causes all suffering. Follow the 8 fold path and get rid of suffering. Free yourself through knowledge and don’t take life too seriously. Live a simple life. Carvaka school is the hedonistic philosophy that says there is no god so let’s just enjoy the most pleasure we can while we’re here.
- Derede nothing exists outside context. There is no subject matter or truth just perspectives and deferrals. Escape of meaning to trying to be pinned down. Trying to understand things by pinning them down only makes it more confusing. Things are defined by what is unsaid or left in the margin. Very philosophical kinda nonsensical but not fully nothing. Philosophy is bias by our current view and past philosophers can become prominent in the future, but even if they’re work exist now we don’t recognize it as being good or relevant religious philosophy is nonsensical because if religion is true, then everything is just guided by God anyways so you don’t need philosophy you just need God. Modern philosophy is unclear because we don’t have hindsight bias of Lindy to know who was great. Often ideas of philosophy survive over time and get associated with a thinker through path dependence and luck but they’re more symbolic of a wider movement at that time.
    - **Tags:** #religion, #change-is-cemented-before-we-realize-it-started, #philosophy-=-context-dependent, #context, #posthumous-recognition, #defined-by-boundries, #religious-philosophy, #derede
    - **Note:** Everything is context dependent part of a wider system and things are defined by boundaries what is unsaid or left in the margin.
      Philosophy is not always clear in the moment sometimes people thinkers and movements are only appreciated after death. Kinda like change over before we realize it’s happening. Religious philosophy doesn’t matter because if it’s true god exists and controls everything
- Recur. Cosmological time past present and future and time as the river of time flowing itself human time is both. Story of time is being written and read by ourselves creating our own identity. Our self identity is our reading of our life narrative based on time and perspective and others feelings. Highest values lie in justice and friendship. Needs to be benevolence and reciprocity between people. Delouse all identities are effects of difference and genuine thinking is a violent confrontation with reality. Rupture if established categories. Engagement with philosophy shouldn’t require knowing the past, but being creative with your eye on the future. Empiricist wants to use empiricism to explain what is new not to find eternal but discover new things. Against expertise and experts as barrier to entry. Rejects transcendental. Rejects transcendentalism sees everything on the same plane. Dispel illusions that prevent us from happiness. Imminence is what is empirically real and says that all real things lie on the same plane. No higher world. We must think of things relative to other things. Identity is difference makes it more fundamental than identity. Were defined by our difference. We should be worthy of what happens to us then we become the offspring of our events and reborn. That’s his ethics.

    - **Note:** We’re defined by our boundaries. Deserve what we get. Cosmological time and we write our own narrative and read it to ourselves. That’s our story. Highest calling is friendship rooted in reciprocity. World of relativity hates experts thinks everyone has knowledge and lies on equal plane. Embrace reality.
- Gardner reveals knowledge of truth outside of natural science that can only be understood through understanding. Hermeneutical method we can’t understand history and art through science but through language and lived being do we understand truth. Truth is an event something we encounter. We present ourself to being part of a situation but we are not the entire thing give up effort of control giving up motivation of winning to focus on just playing the game itself. Play absorbs the subject when we’re interpreting a situation and truth through winning comes through the total immersion in the subject and playing in the game. Were taken out of ourself into something larger. Truth comes when art speaks through play to tell you something not theoretical but practical and exestential in your life. We are biased by our prejudices some good some bad. We must just understand and analyze prejudice. Understanding is a historical process. When you can understand something in the system of your biases. Horizon or limit of knowledge like a frame around a picture that helps you see it properly when you merge your horizon with another you broaden your horizons not seeing what’s infront of you worse but better in a deeper more wholistic concept. Human nature is fundamentally linguistics where I and world meet. We must understand the history to understand the present.
- Camus humans have an absurd existence and this implies actual intellectual suicide or courageous acceptance of the absurdity of life and living every day despite its meaninglessness. The struggle of life itself creates meaning in life. De boviare sees woman through the master slave dynamic and women are trying to catch a man’s gaze and this this dynamic relationships must fail.
    - **Tags:** #absurdity, #existentialism, #camus, #meaning-in-suffering
    - **Note:** Life and existence is absurd and we must live every day in the absurdity to prove the world wrong. Meaning through hardship
- Humans exist either in itself for itself or for others. In itself is passive for itself is dynamic humans are trying to always be more than they are or something other than they are. The for others is how we know ourselves but through existing in others consciousness we craft our self image through how others see us. We are free before we meet others and they look at us creating shame or guilt which is a for others things. We objectify others. Existence proceeds essence humans are agonizingly free in the world to create themselves. We are responsible for creating ourselves through our actions. Condemned to be free responsible for everything we do. Being ourselves is the highest calling We need to forget our goals and live the outward manifestation of our dreams and goals that’s living in good faith. Freedom must be self creating.

    - **Note:** Humans passively exist in the world, but when we exist for ourselves, we exist dynamically, and when we exist for others, we reveal who we actually are all problems are interpersonal relationship problems. Mimetic desire concept. We are free before we meet others and they objectify us and we objectify them. Existence proceeds essence. We are responsible for creating ourselves. No one is going to save us. We are condemned to be free. Be ourselves live our goals freedom is self creation.
- Ethical statements are not logical but emotional statements and expressions of attitude. Moral statements are expressions of attitude not fact ethics were just saying how we feel. But rm hair fair they’re attitudes plus prescriptions of morally right making them generalizable. Still said there is no objective values we invent our own values. Argues values are relative not objective and personal or relative to the situation and what is rudhr is the utilitarian view of the most good for the group. We invent our values. Good life is doing what you want. Rule based ethics results based ethics and persons based ethics asks what sort of person should I be. Virtue ethics living with your virtues clear and living to them. Udemonia living a happy life good life. Being person of integrity. Values virtue practical wisdom and udemonia happiness of life and good life. Political theory Rawls asks what political state would you want if you couldn’t choose your place within it. Nozek says state is minimal intervention very libertarian even says people should purchase governance from state. Against state seizure.

    - **Note:** Values are relative to a person and time and we invent our ethics and define what a good life is for us. Ethical statements are not logically justifiable but are anchored to the times.
      Political questions one is libertarian the other is a state you’d want to live in no matter where you were born.
      Virtue ethics having clear virtues and living up to them defining your life by virtues. We invent our values.
      Rule based ethics what you should do person based ethic who you should be.
      Practical wisdom happiness udemonia.
- Individuals mental state exists apart from reality. Indend means directed towards acted upon. There cannot be intentionality without consciousness. Token identity theory. Mental states cause behavior. Eliminative materialism the idea that all mental states can be understood through neuroscience and brainwaves. Consciousness and defining what something is like is a key for physicalists theories. We can know a brain perceives red but until we actually see red a part of our understanding is lost or incomplete. They reason that Qualia creates a gap of interpretation and physicalist theories can’t explain Qualia. There is this gap that exists between physical and psychological that we haven’t solved yet.
    - **Tags:** #subjective-truth, #physical-vs-psychological-consciousness, #neuroscience, #perception-vs-interpretation, #consciousness, #qualia, #nature-of-thought, #understanding-vs-simulating
    - **Note:** The nature of consciousness is unclear. There is a gap between physical and psychological reality that we have not bridged. Maybe we will soon maybe we never will. Qualia are subjective conscious experiences that we cannot yet simulate or understand with science. We cannot see the color red through looking at the brain and how it lights up when the color red is seen. Perception vs interpretation gap
- Philosophy of ordinary language. Philosophy isn’t science but more clarification. Create concepts and constructions but aware of the bounds of the science. Use language to understand human world and science to understand natural world. Map logical geography of concepts by tracing connections. Philosophical behaviorism states of mind aren’t apparent being observed but seen through behavior. You can’t see team spirit but concepts of the mind are observable in behavior. Close attention to language and how it relates to truth. Very semantic but logic is deeper and makes sense. Good concepts but not much life advice more logical optimization. Arguing meaning of words. Created meta and object language. Meta language of snow is white object language could be that in English French ect. Understanding a sentence requires understanding what can verify and falsify it. Theories of meaning and reference some language doesn’t need to be said like asking someone to close a door you can just close it instead of saying yes or if someone asks you if he’s fast and you say he has good spirit cooperative conversations to convey meaning. Names are rigid demonstrators they’re not essential to who someone is. Even if some aspects of a declaration are false the whole statement can be true. Aristotle can still be Aristotle if he didn’t teach Alexander the Great. Words are rough descriptors. Split words and the essence of words they don’t need 100% overlap. Words not the same as meaning.
- Logical positivism only genuine truth comes from well organized empirical science logical analysis and organization of natural phenomena rejects metaphysics. This is about philosophy of science and epistemology. Gödel disproved the idea you can base mathematics on logic. Discourse must be either analytic or empirically testable everything else is meaningless. Science represents only by experience and testable things. Observation isn’t blank but laden with existing theories we look through glasses not at a blank slate. We are testing ideas vs other statement not reality which can lead us to ignore novel views instead of trying to integrate them. Verification is key to the idea of how do you prove something is true. Verification can specify the nature of meaning or as criteria of meaningfulness. Ie something is meaningful through how it’s verified. If you can’t verify something it can’t be true but this restricts science and history. This is factually insignificant. Karnap Science consists of logical and non logical statements. One can be judge through observation others by theory. Analytic and synthetic statements. Philosophic insight can require intense immersion in a problem and can be quick to pass when you’re no longer in that frame of mind.
- Cuine naturalist and existentialist also a falibalist. Believed what exists is what is physically definable. No entity without identity. Rejected reductionism for wholism beliefs were a web but if there was a significant outside event the things in the middle of the web could be disturbed. The things on the outside were the least important most apt to be attacked or changed.
    - **Tags:** #beliefs-are-a-web-(interdependent), #belief-stack/web, #existence-proceeds-essence, #change-your-mind, #complex-adaptive-systems, #identity
    - **Note:** Beliefs are a web with the outside being less important than the inside. Identity proceeds essence. Things can come externally and disrupt the web. Beliefs are complex system and the anatomy changing your mind.
- Wittgenstein all problems of philosophy are problems of language and problems become non problems when we reframe and understand the language better. Problems are just non understanding. What can be said we can say clearly and what is unsaid is nonsense. Language has a structure which shows what can be said and thought beyond these limits language and thought are meaningless and this is the area of traditional philosophical problems. Says showing ethics rather than saying is all that can be defined. We can’t define ethics only show it. Generally most philosophical problems are meaningless.
    - **Tags:** #philosophy, #wittgenstien, #language, #philosophy-of-language, #wordsmithing
    - **Note:** Wittenstein says that all problems are semantic and of language, and when you clarify the language, the answer becomes clear and most philosophical problems are just word, smithing, and meaningless. He’s got some good points here and he’s also kind of the problem himself and saying this. Philosophy of language and argument.
- Popper science isn’t about verification but falsification science proceeds by what can be falsify it. Science should be a set of conjectures and refutations. Science must be falsifiable. Lower probability hypothesis are better. Verisimilitude truth likeness. Obviously the issue is that one small disproving doesn’t lead to any entire theory being wrong. Paradigm shifts and science working within a paradigm.
- Frager split the idea of logic being true and something being true in someone’s mind psychological truths saying logic was the only truth. Truth value of a sentence is defined by its parts. Break down a sentence saying everyone loves someone does everyone love one person or do all one person love another at least one other person. Split ideas into reference if terms and the underlying meaning of terms. The reference value of the morning and evening star being the same can be true but the actually meaning part requires astrological knowledge they are both the same body Venus though. Some things are substitutable. The inter subsitutabily of truth values like a is round and b is round. In philosophy of language we can use different terms for the same concept but this doesn’t effect the actual thing being said. Focused on the deeper meaning not the actual word. Words vs deeper meaning.
    - **Tags:** #semantics-vs-meaning, #logic, #reference-point, #psychological-truths, #frager, #first-principles-thinking, #deep-truths, #reverse-compression-algo
    - **Note:** Semantics versus meaning. Psychological truths are what you believe but logical truths are deductive in nature. Words have a reference value and deeper meaning ultimately the deeper meaning is what matters and language is just a reverse compression algorithm for thought. Focus on deep meaning and first principles.
- Bertrand Russell what one does is relative to who one is a postman vs a mischievous boy ringing doorbells defines expectations and reactions. Transcendental argument starts at the end with X and then works toward the initial conditions of X like you are alive so you must’ve been born. All math can be reducible to logic. Logicism movement. Russell tried to develop an idea of classes and wanted to prove the logical nature of math, but struggled with clear logical contradictions like the barber Paradox. If a barber shaves Everyman in a town but no one can shave them selves does the barber not shave everyone or does he break #1. Russell tries to create hierarchy of classes to get around this. He excepted a priority knowledge after being a strict empiricist. Knowledge of description versus knowledge of acquaintance one you see firsthand the other you hear secondhand but they’re both knowledge. conditional rejections the idea that you can claim if I wasn’t my room, I would see my table, even if no one is quite there to see it. You’re still making a claim of it being real. he aimed to prove things logically, but discovered that things were justified by a priority knowledge and were fallible. All things are made of descriptions of lower level things. Atomic proposition are base level things which can be combinded into complex propositions then into general propositions like all men are older than children.

    - **Note:** Propositions start bottom up. Then can be combinded. Who one is influences how their action is received. Expectation and status influence interactions. Starting with an end then moving backwards. Hierarchy of knowledge. Knowledge of description vs acquaintance. Apriori knowledge. Transcendental arguments start with an end then invert.
- Analytic philosophy goes after detail in what they study. Instead of big picture but go after the same ideas. Analyze underlying structure to solve complex problems. Denotative theory a word is defined by what it denotes. Then there are things like unicorns that can’t be defined because they’re not real Russell wants to keep the idea of true and false together by breaking up the argument. Saying the current king of France is tall or short when there is no king of France would create a logical inconsistency so Russell breaks the statement into two parts one says there is a king of France, which can be true or false and then ask if they king of France tall so both statements need to be true for the entire statement to be true gets around the double negation issue. So bivalence survives, but the important thing of analytic philosophy is your examining all truth conditions of the statement not just a basic this is true or false but also what is this? This is normal philosophy plus more logic. You can analyze things through decomposition reduction getting to the essence of something tracking history of a concept or understanding comparison of the concept in order to clarify or understand the problem.
- Pragmatism. Belief is something that would prompt someone to act. It’s naturally for people to believe. Adapt behavior so more adapted to the world so we can overcome problems and get closer to our goals. Acquisition of true stable beliefs is goal of inquiry. Used scientific method as the best way to judge true beliefs. Pragmatism define what something means by what it does operational definition. Truth is attained when eliminate ideas with no meaning or worth. Accepted fallabism of knowledge. William James focused on truth ie the right belief was what was useful. Truth is agreement between experience and reality. Not looking for deep truth but use what works. Can lead to Santa being real because it’s useful and beneficial to believe. The world is a whole that we actively participate in. Skepticism requires as much proof as belief no beliefs are immune from revision ie fallability practical applications of our beliefs constrain us.

    - **Note:** Pragmatism is just using what works. Knowledge is fallible and we just change our minds to do what achieves our goals. You can adopt crazy beliefs that you know are wrong if they work. Practical over everything.
- Taggart argues against the unreality of time. A series of time past present and future. B series before and after. If time is real both these need to exist. The issue with the series is things are past present and future relative to other things so everything is past present and future. So time shows change which is evidenced by the a series but given all time is relative you can never properly pick a past present and future point it’ll lead to an infinite regress where you pick a point but you define it as past present or future relative to other points and then you need to define that other point through another point infinite regress so time and change don’t exist. A series is contradictory so there can be no change so with no change time doesn’t exist. C series is b series but fully fixed with no change. B series assumes change but c series doesn’t assume this.
    - **Tags:** #time-philosophy, #time-(nature-of/quantum), #relativity, #taggart
    - **Note:** Taggart theory of Time states that there is both before and after and then there’s past present and future relative to a point in time and these both can’t exist because they’re relative to different things and so there is no definitive past present and future. C series fixes the before and after at a specific time.
- Idealism fundamental nature of the world is mental. Eternal consciousness exists within ourselves and we realize through self actualization. Working with your fellows requires working toward a common good. We all work to better ourselves and also work to better themselves at a societal level. States should allow for people space for self actualization. Fh Bradley saw the world as one integrated being. External relations don’t effect a thing only its internal constitution. External relations are contingent but internal relations are necessary. Think the one thing that exists is experience or sentience.
- Nitzche wasn’t anti semetic his sister was and published his book posthumously with a nazi tilt. She was a nazi. He was curious about the ethical questions that shape your life how should you live and what sort of person should you be. Ethics concerns character where morals concerns actions. Who should I be vs what should I do. Declares god is dead and the entire Christian society has no basis. Need to reevaluate everything and perverted what humanity could be. What was good used to be defined by high minded people but this was upended by a revolt promoted by resentment. Good bad contrast of aristocracy replaced with good vs evil pride with humility. Self denial and sacrifice are virtues. What is good heightens power or feeling of power in man what is bad is born from weakness happiness is growth of power not contentness but desire for more power. Fitness over virtue. Will to overcome frustration to exist so one can create and succeed to strive and desire is the ethical way. Striving and overcoming desire and achieves growth and expansion makes you a Superman. To be a Superman you must be a yes sayer and affirm life as if you could do whatever you wanted. Life as positively and nobly but also requires embracing suffering and grief with courage. Don’t live under illusions but choose happiness when you embrace life. Art is the great beauty of the world. Treat our own life as art and live creatively as autonomous individuals. Be poets of our lives. Reject conventional morality. Revalues old values. Destroy old values and revalue them.

    - **Note:** Revalue and destroy old values question conventional morality and live the lives we want as autonomous creative individuals Superman in our own lives, which is someone who has intense agency and power over their life. The will to be strong fitness over virtue conquering tough times. Killed God and through hard work and agency people live the lives they want. Think independently and live the life you want. Treat life as art and were the painter. Choose happiness and actively live life. Ethics concerns character where morals concerns actions. The world could be defined by everyone not just the aristocracy. Power ethic with very high agency in a world that had been completely inverted class and values wise. Re underwriting the entire values system with the death of god
- Marx religion is a human invention and opioid the masses. Believed competing incentives between labor and capital and wanted equal rights for everyone. Had decent understanding of economics surplus profits going which direction. Wanted to unmask religion as illusionary happiness masking peoples real suffering. True community been suppressed by political and religious oppression. Great ideas just not very feasible. Thinks philosophers interpret the world but should seek to change it. Said materialism failing to recognize how human thought affects the reality they perceive. Human activity is material activity which affects the real world that people before him didn’t recognize. Relation of work and sweat to nature is historical materialism. As conditions of production change over time so do human relationships lives are shaped by economic circumstances when they become more conscious of this they can better free themselves from it. Contradictions between groups create conflict creating synthesis hagelian dialectic. Sees historical process as deterministic with communist end point. Working class must be engaging in revolution runs counter to this determinism in his writing because if it was fully deterministic no action is needed. Works are alienated from the things they produce from other people through transactional relationships satisfaction at work exercise of natural power. Thinks capitalism is unjust communism is right but incentives.

    - **Note:** Marks saw religion as the opioid of the masses and wanted to unmask it. Wanted to free the workers and have equality but communism has bad incentive allignment. Wanted philosopher to be active change makers and people to have more free choice. Saw the world as deterministic but also advocated for a revolution which is backwards.
- John Stewart mills dad was all theory wrote the authoritative book on India that guided policy for brittan despite never going to India and not really liking Indians. His son was well educated but had a nervous breakdown at 20 existential crisis which allowed him to focus on not just theory but internals as well. Individuals are not responsible to society on internal matters and society only controls individual actions that can harm others. Liberty must be defended against coercion. He is classical liberal. He also said we can harm people by what we fail to do which is a step maybe too far or contradictory also defends free expression. Goes against censorship because this can lead to dogma. Believed actions were justified by consequences not intentions like Kant. Utility greatest good for the greatest people based on outcomes was his utilitarianism. Believed in utility at the action level. This does neglect minorities. So utilitarianism have gone more rule based instead of action based.

    - **Note:** John Stewart Mill dad was very successful, but was all theory he had an existential crisis at 20 which changed his life. Becomes classically liberal even says not doing things more than just allowing free expression is important. Pre-expression, utilitarian ethic, classically liberal, and anti-censorship.
- Positivism for example in the law has nothing to do with the law being just but the authority who created that law being just. Comte positivism the only truth comes from strong empircist scientific sources that are well researched and organized. Rejects metaphysics and theology as a source of knowledge. Believed that laws governing individuals was as scientific as the hard sciences. Comte positivism turned into a religion and went a little power crazy lost a lot here.

    - **Note:** Positivism is very empirical and projective. Things were following a natural order. Rejected metaphysics and theology only what would be proved was science. Law comes from authority and justified true belief.
- Schopenhauer believed in phenomenal world represented in our experience like Kant. And phenomenal and numenal word. Rejected that we can’t understand numenal world that means we could tap the will as a single fundamental reality. Knowledge is secondary to will and what drives the world. The will causes suffering and to release yourself from suffering you must transcend the will. Understand unity of self and reality to transcend the will. Art and music take us out of this suffering and brings us into the present through beauty. To exist is to suffer. Ground of his ethics is compassion. Compassion is immediate participation with no ulterior motives in support of another who is suffering to prevent or aid their suffering for all human and animals. Helping someone who needs help the joy is in the help.
- Hagel, soft philosophy, as movement of political and social reform. Restore harmony between ideas and practice. Reason can transcend boundary of empirical experience. Hagel switched thinking that the human Geist had reached fulfillment Geist is the universal mind or agency. We develop understanding through time and he thought he was at the end of history. Self-consciousness is one of his biggest advancements Self-consciousness is recognized through viewing another consciousness. We only see we are ourselves through seeing others. Hagel argues for natural outcome between two self-consciousness is conflict, creating a master slave relationship. Then the masters, taking away everything a slave makes and has property over him which led to the exploitation of labor idea for Marx. Says we can try to escape the world like stoic, but ultimately we can never do so, and this creates a torn consciousness between master and slave in our head. Absolute knowledge is not understanding the world, but a mind understanding itself. Hagel dialectic clash of two opposites leads to conflict then synthesis. Thesis and antithesis create new synthesis. History is programmed with consciousness of freedom, but he picks examples like Persia and ignores examples like Asia to create a Procrustean bed of ideas. Self-awareness everyone is responsible for their own decisions. Individual freedom one is free if you do your duty because it liberates you from desire so freedom is performing within your niche pushes for constitutional monarchy. The left hagelians after his death created a revised philosophy of human kind focusing on real people in real life led to Karl Marx.

    - **Note:** Hagel was the father to Marx. They took his monarchy ideas and adapted it to communism. Wanted to create harmony between ideas and practice. Reason can transcend boundaries of experience. Geist is the universal mind or agency. Thought we were at the end of history. We only see ourselves through seeing others. We stand alone unchanging but realize through others we are unique. We have two selves in conflict and this creates a torn consciousness. Master and slave ideas adopted by communism. True understanding isn't external but internal. His dialectic is thesis antithesis synthesis. Take agency over your life. We have control over our actions no one is coming to save us
- Bentham utilitarian greatest happiness for greatest number. Argued for parliamentary reform to avoid revolution did not believe in natural rights and had a negative view of liberty ie protecting people by limiting what others can do. Reduce happiness to maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain very simple.

    - **Note:** Utilitarian ethic, maximizing pleasure, and minimizing pain, limitation and negative view of happiness
- Intellectual immaturity needs guidence maturity is independence. Enlightenment thinkers didn’t think of themselves as making progress but coming out of the darkness. Nothing required for enlightenment but freedom in all matters. Free thinkimg and radically inquiry grounded in experiment and science. Applied empiricism and experiment first to science then to religion and philosophy which brought us into the modern age. Enlightenment project was repudiation of religion over thought to allow people to use reason and science to build a better life uniquely from themselves. Create your own life and moral code was the waking up of the individual from a guided life to a path they could create. Key to enlightenment was getting information turning information into knowledge then turning knowledge into understanding to live a better and more open life. Use knowledge to spread light. Romanticism has reason give way to emotions and beauty. These are both important in thought. Romantics created the idea of personal truth and put race over reason. Enlightenment thinkers weren’t dogmatic in their support of reason. They were self critical of enlightenment thinking didn’t overrate reason understood its limits. People argued that mastery over nature led to facism or master over people. Rejected scientism and mass culture as negatives of enlightenment but this misses the core values. Enlightenment is waking people up with reason not dogmatism.
- Kant Apriori vs apostori knowledge. Apriori known independent from experience. Aposteriory is seen as the only way to create knowledge by empiricists. We apply our apriori concepts on data to create perception. Basically there is a bias inherent in models. He unites empiricists and rationalists. We can make observations about the world but we need a different method to see beyond the bounds of cause and effect. He provides categorical imperatives not subjective called maxims but objective rules called laws that must be obeys no ifs involved. These laws are how all rational being must live. Treat humans as ends. Rule based ethic cares about inputs being right not the outcomes being virtuous. Doesn’t worry about outcomes. Believes everyone can understand and live morally. Autonomy or freedom is the basis for morality or supreme principle of morality. Thinks humans generally understand morality. Freedom is necessary condition was an enlightenment believe. Freedom from censorship. Didn’t believe in religion but in using an eternal soul to justify morality if need be. Humanistic beliefs everyone can be moral enlightenment thinker.

    - **Note:** Apriori knowledge is before vs aposteriory is after analysis. We make observations and then we make assumptions about the world. One is knowledge, independent of thought, and the other is knowledge biased by our thoughts. Creates the categorical imperative which tells you there is a truth in all situations. There is true morality outside of outcomes. Liberal and enlightenment, beliefs of autonomy and freedom.
- Russeu created the idea of the noble savage in state of nature. Were born free and become chained in society. Social life outside of nature leads to dependence and subordination rule by the rich. How can people be free in a state of the world. He wants things to conform to a general will. People give power to government but eventually become subordinates to it. Believes religion is good to set a moral governor for how people should live. Keeps the peace. Wanted the people to be free spoke truth to power and had some trouble in that.
    - **Tags:** #live-with-nature, #truth-to-power, #freedom, #noble-savage, #russeu, #happiness, #power-in-the-real-world, #power-games, #religion, #morality
    - **Note:** Believe that people were happier in the state of nature and that they gave power to the government, but then could not take that power back after it was given, so it was stolen in a sense. Live with nature religion gives morality. Spoke truth to power.
- Fundamental concept of reality to us rests not on our reason but on the constitution of our reality. Doesn’t assume external world strict empiricist perceptions are impressions and ideas. Ideas are copies of impressions complex ideas are made of many simple impressions together. Association of ideas comes from relation cause and effect and continuity or things happening at the same place or time. All these things are association that make us assume causation. Minds function through comparing ideas and inferring facts. There are no moral facts we graph our beliefs onto situation for morals. Morals are subjective. Reason guides but cannot prompt people. There is no moral facts and only emotion can prompt action not reason incentives you can’t derive an ought from and is. What you should do from an objective situation. Believed human nature was benevolent and constant. Natural and artificial natural natural ones are inherent in human condition artificial are emergent from it. Believed in a moral life living with classical virtues. Loved when men of letters and men of the world talked about the meaning of life not from ivory towers but from places of common man.
- Liebnitz invented calc along with newton but wasn’t given credit. Thinking split with Principal of non-contradiction both an and not an and sufficient reason ie everything has a cause. If 2 things have the same property they are not 2 things but the same thing. All things in the predicate term are already contained in the subject like the capital of France contains Paris principal of analticity. Principal of continuity things exist continuously and never make leaps and all things exist for the best. Even short term bad is long term good. All things exist as indivisible substance containing all their past present and future properties concept of substance individuates the substance and only god can understand the totality of it. Each substance is a mind like entity complete world in itself simple substance called a monad. Perception is what individuates these. Did believe humans had free will through ignorance of not knowing the future. Philosophy wanted a complete and integrated system but he couldn’t complete it in time very big task.

    - **Note:** Liebnitz humans have free will through ignorance. Principle of non contradiction and sufficient reason. Things are contained in other things. Principal of analticity. Self referential. Principle of continuity. Each substance has a monad which allows it to have agency and think for itself.
- Barkley argues against materialism for idealism means mind is ultimate reality. Mind is single infinite mind and mind is the ultimate reality. He wanted refute epistemological skepticism says we cannot know true nature of thing because of perception and psychology so reality is hidden behind appearance and aethism. He Denys there’s a gap between experience and the world. Spirit and mind are the same thing. Perceiving active being is yourself and separate from what you perceive. There is no gap between things and ideas. To be is to be perceived. Things only exist through our sense perception like mountains the world exists independent of people but argues that things must be perceived to exist. Tree falls in the forest doesn’t make a noise if not perceived. Things are ideas and only can be translated by mind so they can’t exist outside of mind. Thus There is no other substance other than spirit. Instrumentalists sees science as tools and theories as more or less useful doesn’t have to be true. Like a knife or fork as more useful. Verisimilitude. Pitched infinite mind. His ideas of god take a big mental leap. He says all minds exist then makes the argument from design.
    - **Tags:** #perception-shapes-reality, #perceived-vs-actual-state, #perception-vs-interpretation, #mind/body-problem, #barkley, #verisimilitude
    - **Note:** Barkley was an instrumentalist, but had ideas around verisimilitude. Things needed to be perceived to be real, but there was no mind and soul. It was just one. There is just a world of the mind and everything else is ancillary. Things can’t exist outside the mind. Everything is perception even mountains.
- Locke brought empiricism to England. Ideas and words sensation and deeper reflection basis of knowledge. Knowledge is split into physics morals and semiotics which is how the mind conveys ideas. You have simple ideas like color and complex ideas of thought. Primary quality’s things we see secondary qualities the agency we give to things like wood being solid or shape vs color or taste that comes from our interaction with the item. Knowledge is conversant with general ideas. Words and ideas are a reverse compression algorithm to turn mental conceptions into representations for others. People were seen as bodies and emortal souls but locked imvented the idea of consciousness to define people which offended the church. This the identity of a person over time the same consciousness. Made memory basis of identify so if you had memory loss you can be considered different than your past self. Identity isn’t continuous. Obvious disagreement leads to intuitive knowledge non intuitive knowledge requires reason this is demonstrative knowledge. Empirical knowledge arises through our sense interactions is defeasable as we can have sense errors or corrections. Generally perception is reliable but sometimes wrong. Locke wrote against the Devine right of sovereigns and kings. All people have rights to life liberty and property natural laws no total sovereign. Everyone has right to self determination and obligation to protect others rights to self determination in an active sense if need be. Power is a trusteeship and if the trustees abuse it the people must take it back. Creation of liberalism.

    - **Note:** Locke had the idea that everyone was endowed with freedom and self determination and that while they vested their governing interests in a sovereign if that government was not good it could be deposed. Split knowledge into sensory experience and higher mind of meaning from those experiences. Simple and complex ideas. We have things with a primary quality which is physical then the agency or models that we attribute to those things. Words are a reverse compression algo. Was the first person to understand identity and consciousness. Said memory was identity which isnt right but invented the concept of consciousness. Right place and time for ideas. Like first principles and second level thinking
- Spinoza excommunicated from synagogue for heresy. Use reason to understand the true nature of things. Spinoza had only one substance in the world that was god everything made from this mind and body one everything was deterministic. Every being has an individual desire for self determinism despite being part of one substance. Freedom can be active or passive the more right our ideas are the more active freedom we have he equates with virtue says virtue is the same as power which he equates to agency and ability to do things. When we have control over our reactions to external events and can respond with reason we have control very stoic. State shouldn’t control what people think but keep the peace of society. State frees everyone from fear so people can live the lives they want. Universe is all that exists and the good life is one free to pursue your life. Free thought highest importance. Life of rational inquiry and free pursuit of knowledge is vital.

    - **Note:** spinoza believed the state was there to help people gain agency protect them from harm so they can do what they wanted very liberal view. One universal substance. Freedom can be an active or passive thing. Active freedom is powerful because it gives you agency over your life. We cant control events but control our reactions to events very stoic. Free thought and rational inquiry is peak life. States should allow people to think open mindedly.
      Control over your life agency liberal though states reduce pain. Agency is active freedom
- Hobbes Absolute control of the government in society. Only source of safety is from a common power a leviathan. The sovereign has complete and total power but must protect the people if he doesn’t then the people must overthrow him. Brings in equality individual rights and ultimate political authority comes from the consent of the people. Liberty and natural rights. Authority comes from voluntary giving up power liberty is absence to external constraints to motion. Negative vs positive liberty absence of restraint vs absence of dependence there are rights that require active protection like freedom of assembly and from oppression that negative liberty don’t protect

    - **Note:** Hobbs is Leviathan complete power to the government, but the people can and should overthrow the government abuses power. Ultimate authority from people. Freedom from and freedom to. Freedom from oppression and to assemble.
- Empiricist vs rationalists all knowledge must be testable by experience of the world aided by instruments vs rational knowledge can only be attained by reason from first principles. Kant synthesized these ideas saying inputs from the outer world and transformation of those in the mind make experience both important to create our full picture. Bacon was the creator of the scientific method and urged collaboration in science. Relied on observation and reason like was done in antiquity vs the justified true belief of the religious era. Created the modern mind. Descartes started with doubting everything and only declared what couldn’t be doubted as real leading to I think therefore I am. Everything is material or mental substance. Essence of matter is extension and mind is thought. Dualism came from this mind and matter don’t interact they just seem to do so. They thought the mind and body didn’t interact. They had no idea how these interacted.

- Pico was brought in by the medicis and started the humanist beliefs in the reminiscence from the religious fear of the time before. Reminiscence or rebirth of classical views after time of religious ones. Humanists believed classical literature produced intellectual discipline much was a rediscovery of what was previously lost. Humanists were taught to normal people who would become ruler not taught as advanced philosophy in university which led to more rulers and better city states not just random debate. Renaissance was the reconcile of pagan philosophy of the Greeks with scripture not original ethical debate. Middle class people are moderately well off they don’t want to lose what they have but don’t have the means or desperation to go for more. Happy to be happy body of people. Government is meant to serve the people and allow them to live their life. Bruni said flourishing in art came from Florence’s ability to defend themselves and institutions to prevent things from being taken from within. Internal glory came from Republican constitution external protection from threats of war. Praised active life and that each person should be virtuous ruler and constituent. Machiavelli rulers must balance ferocity and cunning ruling by virtue is ruinous but does say rulers should care about constituents. Ruler should aim at benefit of state not person. Most important task of ruler is to maintain power to keep order. You need to be virtuous and ruthless when necessary. Better to be feared than loved because sometimes a prince must be cruel. Don’t pretend virtue just do what you must do to keep power. System should aim to achieve glory so in discourses he argues for republic over prince. Arm the people and let the people guard it. Pay price of instability of people to achieve greater outcome. Self preservation above everything. Thomas Moore Pursuit of virtue for its own sake vs leasure as the platonic good of the state.

    - **Note:** Renaissance was mainly a rediscovery bringing back pagan philosophy. Humanists taught to average middle class people. Middle class ethic being ok where you are you dont want to risk going down which prevents you from speaking your mind to go up as well just stay in line not desperate but content. Government serves people. Florence outside protection allowed for internal flourishing. Need outside protection. Rulers benefit the state machievelli no virtue signaling just keep power and stability. Self preservation better to be feared because at least then you keep your power.
- The idea of a God or gods is tough to define, which is difficult for philosophy, but a strength inherent in religion because it’s tough to reject what isn’t clearly defined. Can’t argue against what nothing can be said about. Philosophical problems with Christianity involved the problem with evil if there is a God then why do bad things happen. Says god uses evil to make the world a better place. Says evil is the result in of free will created by god but once given some people become internally evil. Excused gods existence in time. Says time is all relative to the present moment. These are by st Augustine. Boethesis argues for universal but only through particulars. Also argues for internal goods vs externals. Actions shaped by intentions not outcomes which implies free will. St thomas adopted much of Aristotle’s revived views and thought the soul existed separately from the body. Matter stays the same form can change. Acquinus created a complete system adopted by the church so complete no challenges could be made. Bacon was mid evil but was one of the first scientists in that time. Occam powers of mind allow us to turn sensory into propositional knowledge not just like animals. Occam believes aggressively in free will that it can determine itself.

    - **Note:** God is a tough argument because there is a deterministic world with him so nothing we do matters everything is predetermined. Can't argue against nothing. Problems of evil should not exist and requires a lot of mental gymnastics to accommodate both god and bad things. Internal vs external goods. Unclear argument for free will. Religion isn't inherently good to bad but the arguments for and against it have caused a lot of issues which is the bad part. These are interesting moral questions related to religion that we must all ask ourselves. This is not the simplest explanation. Can't reject what isn't clearly defined
- Neoplatonism rejected the materialism of stoicism for the domain of the mind. More religious than practical. Two principles were mind over matter in importance ultimate cause of all things is a single unitary principle. Cause of anything contains more than its effect in order to bring it into being. Mind is the cause of the universe one mind. Accepts initial platonic outlook, then develops on it. Universe unfolds into stages with a universal flow. Reality is the output of mind. The universe is a mental construct. Hierarchy with soul over matter. Evil results from focusing on the material things below not the mental things above. Live within nature embraced by Christian’s with similar beliefs. This was transformed from philosophy by 2 human nature constructs toward superstition and hunger for simple stories to provide a framework for someone place in the universe and the universe itSelf. A simplified religion to know what to believe without thinking. Wanting to believe in magic.

    - **Note:** Neoplatonism was a religious movement that was an early influence on Christianity. Mind over matter and ultimate cause. Reality is the output of the mind what we see is a mental construct. Humans want to believe in magic human nature and value of stories. Evil comes from materialism love with nature.
- Skepticism we must withhold belief world is probablistic. There is no criterion of truth. Truth can’t be discovered. Commitment to suspension of belief. Act by what impression seems most reasonable even if it’s not true. Kinda versiliamilatude. Knowledge is impossible and said the world is impossible to understand. We cannot judge truth. Skeptic acts on the most persuasive and probablistic measure hear all the evidence weigh the facts that hold up to more tests as the way to live. Acceptable to evaluate different beliefs for best answer as long as you recognize they’re all wrong. One has to start from a hypothesis but this doesn’t mean it’s true. Nothing really exists. We have no views on anything and take no sides. Suspend judgement. We can’t know anything. 4 skeptical foundations. Any subject has conflicting views making it impossible to accept one side so we must suspend judgement. When one makes a claim it may be supported by prior claims in an infinite regress. Everything is relative things depend on the conditions of their perception or judgement. All judgement rests on assumptions that have alternatives assumptions so we must suspend judgement. In trying to confirm a judgement we create circular references so we must suspend judgement. Committed to investigation and inquiry don’t assert but report and act on perceptions not knowledge.

    - **Note:** Skepticism says all knowledge is fallible and so we just need to come up with the best answer and live our lives through the probabilistic optimum respecting that it is wrong and is also biased by our perspective. Because everything is false and can take zero sides there’s bias and inherent in and all of our models. Everything is relative and based on our assumptions. Perception shapes the world. Maintain doubt suspend judgment.
- Stoicism dedicated on how to live. How to act and be acted upon. Reason is a fundamental principal of matter logos. Logos is a physical thing. Sees everything as true or false so even statements about the future are making the world deterministic. An impression isn’t knowledge it needs to be supported by more but that is that something more core questions of philosophy. Happiness is the goal of life and the good is living with nature. The good is prudence courage moderation and justice wealth can be good but can also have value this isn’t a core good but can be preferred to other bad things but this isn’t an end in itself. We can prefer them but they aren’t ends if they conflict with the wholly good we can’t prefer it. When we have the goods we will be happy. We must control what we can control control the mind and face everything we can’t control with courage. Action is what we do passion is what we undergo without a choice we must be indifferent to the passions. They can’t master us. They saw lust and passion as things inflicted on us. Ask if we can do something about it if yes act if not let it pass thinking more on the subject doesn’t serve you. Bear with what you can’t change. Be patient with life don’t be overtaken by impressions and keep the perception reality gap. Don’t torment yourself with anxiety it’s our own beliefs that make us happy or sad to achieve the good life. There is nothing good or bad our thinking makes it so. Puts key to happiness in our own hands. Free yourself from fear and death. Reason is liberation for happiness.

    - **Note:** Happiness is the goal in life and its up to us to control our happiness through our beliefs. We must free ourselves from fear and death. World is deterministic and we must act with logic. Happiness is the goal of life and we must live with nature. Good is prudence courage moderation and justice. Things outside of the core virtues can be preferred and bad things are meant to be endured through a strong internal locus of control we are meant to grow through hardship. Live with nature master the world dont let it master us. Dont worry about what you cant control
- Epicurus pursuit of pleasure rejection of pain. Believed in atoms and the void everything was complex with parts atomistic belief. Sees world as entirely physical and we have all perceptions as real because mind and body are the same stuff everything is material. No life after death because there is nothing there is nothing to fear. Pleasure is the absence of pain in the body and trouble in the mind we achieve this through simple life and sober reasoning. Understand every choice and banish the negative thoughts understand nature of the world through seeing reason and reality. Has issue of free will. Friendship is mutual altruism starts with mutual need then evolves. Philosophy telling the soul what is good for it. Happiness comes from understanding nature of things and living in accordance with them.
- Lack of security in life led philosophy to be less about metaphysics and more about security and living the good life in bad times. Strengthen inner resolve despite putter unrest. Cynics lives with nature opposed to convention and conventional ambitions consonance and Hartihood as a principal. They didn’t care about their obligation to society. Thought they only needed a very simple life. Life simple in natural. Pooped in public and walked naked. Goal of life was happiness and clarity of mind. Self sufficiency live with no shame and spur laws of state. Embrace simplicity as the way to life and live in the city as walking proof. Freedom from desire simplicity is happiness.
- Aristotle wanted to grasp the fundamental nature of being. This is metaphysics. Substances are can exist on their own and be separated from a pack like a man is a substance a leg isn’t. Best society is when the best individuals members live the best kind of lives. Sees politics is the highest end because it aims at societal ends where sandwich makers end is only making a sandwich education also a high art. Each good has an end that serves a higher end but the supreme end is the good desired for its own sake. Happiness or flourishing is the ultimate end. The single end but this isn’t the result of any activity but when we live in accordance with how a human should live. The end is the result of living a good life process. Aristotle argues good person lives in accordance with virtue. Virtues of mind and character split in mind to practical and theoretical virtues. Acquire good habits then practical wisdom. Virtue is the middle path of opposing vices. Courage is the middle between brashness and cowardice virtue is the golden mean. You can be angry in the right way too it’s situation dependent too. Some situations require more or less of an anger to achieve the golden mean. It’s all relative and that’s relative. Turtles all the way down. The best outcome isn’t always the direct middle. The highest life is the one as a philosopher exercising reason. Don’t rely on external pleasures or good but achieve happiness through exercise of our own intellect. Make a noble use of our leisure that is ultimate goal of learning and life. Believes in the world revolving around the earth made of ether the earth was made of the 4 elements. Shift from being center of universe to random star was very hard to swallow.

    - **Note:** Substances have a level of being. A person is a substance part of them isnt. Best society is when everyone can live the lives they want, have agency. Everyone is serving an end but politics is the highest end because most good for most people. There is a hierarchy of ends like a sandwich maker vs education ect. Highest/ ultimate end is happiness and living in accordance with nature results in a good life the life of virtue. Virtuous life is the golden mean the proper balance between extremes of the virtues not always the direct middle. Internal locus of control for happiness. Ultimate aim is learning in life
- Aristotle - Split science which he saw as another word for philosophy into theoretical and practical philosophy. He writes on methods of inquiry or reasoning. Sees world through propositions made Subject and predicates. Predicates are judged by either categories or 5 words. Substance quality quantity and relation are the 4 main categories. Adds place time position condition passivity and activity it’s not an exhaustive list. Then also classes relating to each other like all as are bs or cs are bs not as like a ven diagram. Split into genus species difference property and accident these are the 5 words or how a predicate relates to a subject. All things have causes and eventually you reach a point where your definition is the same as the cause this is when explanation stops. Causes are material efficient formal and final for a table it would be wood carpenter actual table in its physical form then eating on it. The final cause is most important. The end. The purpose or telos. we should see things as composites of matter and form. Universal combined with an actual thing. Things have passive and active potential to change or cause change. Then he works back to one god moving everything. The soul is the final cause of the body. Activity and motion are the results of desire. Express internal states with external actions.
- Plato - The best state and person is rules by wisdom and virtues the best life is balanced. Plato then went on to develop his theory of universals and particulars. The perfect form of an Apple then an actual apple. Knowledge is 3 things knowing something is true like a fact knowing how to do something or knowing a person or place. Plato sees knowledge as acquiantence with the forms so he sees knowledge as the 3rd of these. Knowledge is acquired through sense perception, it’s true belief, or it’s true belief with justification. Sees the form of the good as the highest form. We still struggle with how to get knowledge is it justified true belief most likely but what is that actually justification and justification process.
- Socrates famous for the Socratic method of using questions to get to an answer. Uses essence of definition then breaks that down to make it stronger. Socrates sometimes ends up proving that we are very ignorant of more than we think the issue is that he never produced a final definition just proved our ignorance which isn’t ideal. Plato was for philosopher kings not democracy. Plato’s fundamental questions what is the best life and right kind of society what is knowledge and how do we get it what is fundamental nature of reality. To answer these big questions we must first answer smaller questions about truth and reason the mind ect. These are all the big questions in philosophy really that have tried to be answered. Allegory of the cave we only see illusions of knowledge we are prisoners and must step out to see the light and see things as they truly are. Believes we have some soul that knows everything and our person is just discovering those things that has reason spirit and appetite. Knowledge feelings and bodily desire. Argued for rule of aristocratics who were chosen by merit and not interested in money just the state. Democracy would eventually become anarchy and leads to tyranny.

    - **Note:** Socratic method breaks down and builds up thinking from first principles but it does not commit to a path as well as languishing in theory
      Fundamental questions, best life, right society, what is knowledge, what is fundamental nature of reality.
      To learn we must answer the small questions first then we can build up to the bigger answers about truth and reason. Allegory of the cave. We only see illusions of knowledge we must step out of the cave into the light and see the world as it is.
      Argued against democracy.
- Any philosophers died for their beliefs at this point. Zeno was the inventor of the concept of infinity through his paradoxes that only got debunked through calculus and others 20th century advances. One can traverse an infinitely divisible space in a finite time. Paradoxes arise from conflict between conceptual conveniences we create that don’t fully represent our reality but are convenient. Paradoxes tell us when we look through different models we get different answers appearance isn’t reality. Atomism democratus everything made of small uncountable atoms. There were atoms that never moved and the void. It was along the lines of the unchanging world. Sophists taught people how to talk and win arguments but not seek truth as the most important still speaking was vital and good communication was important. They also had the idea of relative truth different people could have different truths. They were teachers and speakers but talked about relative not absolute truth. Everyone had their truth.
- Thales is the first philosopher to ground his thinking in reason. Had the idea of agency in things. These people proposed the ideas of natural laws. Things are created and destroyed in an infinite cycle. They were looking for the essential nature of universe like water or air. Pythagoras was seen as the first scientist ls because they had a theory that provided a quantified description of an observed phenomena and generalized idea to nature. This was done through tones of strings. Xenophanies argued against sports having meaning and spending money on that vs art and rejected religious ideas arguing for scientific explanations for earthquakes. Argues for god as nature. Hereclutus the world is in flux. Things stay the same only through flux by changing. Arguing life is a process not a thing. Unity of opposites because the world is in flux up and down are the same thing a staircase youth and age both exist in us but also are different. The tension between opposites is what holds things/ existence together. All things happen through strife and necessity. He believed everything was in flux but knowledge was vital still. Argued for moderation. Others said change and motion weren’t really concepts there was just what is. Just one state. Promenades believed this and demonstrated the power of the 1. A god life unchanging universe. There was nothing outside the one.

    - **Note:** The beginning of philosophy the pre-socratics were pulling the world away from the religious lense into one more grounded in empirical reality and reason. Science and philosophy but still biased by their original worldviews.
      Hereclituian flux is a concept that the world is a process not a thing and we only maintain our nature by changing so life is a tension of evolution and the past pulling us back. Opposites are the same because they hold eachther together. Opposites create push and pull that creates uniqueness and reality. We're defined by our boundries
