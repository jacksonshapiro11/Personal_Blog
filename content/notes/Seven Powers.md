    - **Note:** At different times you emphasize different parts of the seven powers. You should make different ones a focus at different times.
- Takeoff period is the time when a new invention meets an expanding market ready to be siezed and the fastest out of the gate here has a huge competitive advantage going forward

- Invention opens the door to market power and expands market size
    - **Tags:** #invention, #market-growth
- Process power imbedded company activity and organization sets knowledge built up over a long time horizon that enable lower costs or superior product and can only be match by intense commitment. Process power = strong processes + time and positive variance to hone the processes
    - **Tags:** #seven-powers, #process-power
    - **Note:** Organizational knowledge that creates a unique differentiation and special sauce creating a barrier to entry over time.
- Cornered resource definition having access to something no one else has access to. Preferential access to coveted asset that can enhance value disproportionately. Tests 1. Idiosyncratic persistently able to do something good. Pixar had a cornered resource on talent 2. Can’t be arbitraged 3. Resource could be transferable 4. Ongoing superior returns 5. Sufficient for ongoing differential returns given operational excellence

- Branding the durable attribution of higher value to an objectively similar offering that arises from historical information about the seller. No one got fired for buying ibm coke vs generic cola. In order to associate with an identity you need to distinguish the exclusion of alternative identities. Brand is most important in bad tail risks like medicine you would pay for brand
    - **Tags:** #brand-=-promise, #tail-risk, #legitamacy, #branding, #seven-powers, #you-don't-get-fired-for-hiring-ibm
    - **Note:** Brand is something that really resonates with you and engenders trust. A brand is a promise a story something that means something. Brand limits downside through trust.
- Switching costs value loss expected by a customer to be incurred by switching products for future purchases could be financial procedural and relationships wise
    - **Tags:** #definitions, #switch-costs
    - **Note:** Switching cost definition
- Counter positioning too much collateral damage for the leader to undertake the strategy ie Kodak and digital cameras. A newcomer adopts a new superior business model which the incumbent can’t mimic due to significant damage to their existing business. Sometimes counter positioning doesn’t make sense from the competitors standpoint and they need to milk their profits ie the other option is NPV negative. Of the option is NPV positive they need to consider if there is a cognitive bias at work or agency issues. If the people in charge views are so entrenched they will struggle to see how a counter positioned strategy can help at all while if there is an agency issue and their job might be hurt or significantly effected why would they take up the new strategy incentives are wrong
    - **Tags:** #disruptive-innovation, #seven-powers, #counter-positioning, #non-consensus-and-right
    - **Note:** Counter positioning is important because you need to take the opposite route and it’s necessarily very hard for an incumbent to flip their entire strategy and eat their entire business. Non consensus and right.
