- Summary: This text discusses essential editing principles for improving writing clarity, such as restating key points, simplifying language by removing excess words, and avoiding adverbs. It emphasizes the importance of clearly conveying ideas, breaking up complex sentences, and avoiding assumptions about the reader's knowledge to enhance readability. The author's editing philosophy revolves around saying exactly what you mean without unnecessary words and considering the reader's perspective for effective communication.

### Highlights

- Don’t use adverbs
  This aversion to adverbs is one of the principles I’ve taken from fiction-writing.
  **You can almost always replace an adverb with a better, more specific verb, or describe what you mean instead.** Being more specific is especially key in fiction, but I believe in stripping out adverbs in all types of writing.
  There is nothing *inherently* wrong with adverbs. They are just part of a category of things that I believe are lazy in writing. When I say “He laughed loudly,” I’m relying on my reader somehow intuiting the precise volume of his laughter. “Loudly” could mean a million things, but what I really had in mind is that “He laughed with the kind of booming abandon that made the whole restaurant turn around and look.”
  People also often use adverbs as a hedge: “Basically, it's this.” “Essentially, this is what I’m saying.” Is it, or isn’t it? Remove the adverb and commit to saying whatever you’re saying. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvfd4ph0869gd57y4eq4ppsm))
- Let’s start with an example, and look at a few ways we can improve it.
  > *Example:* This chart shows the TTFB for our website over the past week.
  To some people, this sentence makes perfect sense. To many people… not so much.
  • *Spell out acronyms on first use.* Any time you introduce an acronym or an initialism in a document, spell out what it means and put the acronym in parentheses. Thereafter, you can use the acronym by itself.
  > *Revision 1:* This chart shows the time to first byte (TTFB) metric for our website over the past week.
  You might think it’s obvious what an acronym means, but a new reader may not.
  • *Add a phrase or a sentence briefly explaining a concept when you introduce it.*
  > *Revision 2:* This chart shows the time to first byte (TTFB) metric for our website over the past week. TTFB measures how long it takes from when a user makes an HTTP request to when the user’s browser loads the first byte of data. It’s used as an indicator of how responsive a website is.
  • *Link out to further reading.* Once you define a concept and the corresponding acronym, provide a link to somewhere that the reader can learn more about that concept if they’re still curious. You don’t have to call attention to the link.
  > *Revision 3:* This chart shows the [time to first byte (TTFB) metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_first_byte) for our website over the past week. TTFB measures how long it takes from when a user makes an HTTP request to when the user’s browser loads the first byte of data. It’s used as an indicator of how responsive a website is.
  By now, your readers are with you, and they’re ready to proceed, feeling confident that they have an idea of what you’re talking about. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvfdbgs2snfpk2je6s2p09rq))
    - **Note:** Spell things out make them obiovus
- Avoid jargon and cliches
  In the business world, [jargon](https://www.grantthornton.com/-/media/content-page-files/press-releases/2018/Jargon-Index-2018.ashx?la=en) means things like “deep dive“ and “low-hanging fruit”. Elsewhere, we love to use cliches. Especially baseball metaphors, for some reason: “step up to the plate,” “hit it out of the park,” “take a swing at it.”
  It will always be better and clearer when you say exactly what you mean. **Using jargon is lazy, and it assumes that the reader is part of the in-group that uses that jargon** (see also: Don’t assume knowledge, above). It can be difficult for non-native English speakers (or non-Americans, when it comes to baseball) to follow your writing when you use jargon and cliches.
  > *Example:* tl;dr, if you can hack something together by EOD, that would be great.
  > *Revision:* Can you deliver a prototype by the end of today?
  The original sentence has incomprehensible acronyms and tech slang, and doesn’t even sound like a request. The second one is straightforward, and asks for what the writer needs and by when. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvfd9ynt8v1txndbc9m7qqqd))
    - **Note:** Jargon and cliches are lazy writing much like assuming knowledge
- Conclusion
  To simplify what you’ve just read, my editing philosophy can be reduced to two tenets:
  • *Say exactly what you mean*, which means not relying on adverbs, jargon, cliches, or hedges, and
  • *Take out all unnecessary words*.
  Keeping these two tenets in mind will help you in your own writing, and will give you a framework for evaluating other people’s writing. Over time, as you practice, you’ll develop your own style and preferences. You may end up diverging from some of my recommendations, and that’s great, as long as you know *why* you’re doing so. **The point of editing is to think about how you’re using language and to make choices that suit the message you want to deliver**, *not* to unquestioningly follow rules—mine or anyone else’s.
