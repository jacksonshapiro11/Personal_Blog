- Category: #articles

- Summary: The tech industry is increasingly prioritizing profit over user experience, making our digital lives feel hostile and abusive. Many apps and platforms manipulate users through ads and invasive design choices, leading to a sense of constant frustration. As a result, billions of people are negatively affected, often without realizing the true extent of this digital exploitation.

### Highlights

- Perhaps that’s semantics. However, Cory’s theory lacks a real perpetrator beyond corporations that naturally say “alright we’re gonna do Enshittification now, watch this.” Where The Rot Economy separates is that growth is, in and of itself, the force that drives companies *to* enshittify. While enshittification neatly fits across companies like Spotify and Meta (and their ad-focused business models), it doesn’t really make sense when it comes to things where there isn’t a clear split between business customers and consumers, like Microsoft or Salesforce — because enshittification is ultimately one part of the larger Rot Economy, where everything must grow forever.
  And I believe the phenomenon that captures both is a direct result of the work of [men like Jack Welch and Milton Friedman](https://www.wheresyoured.at/tss/). The Rot Economy is selfish and potently [neoliberal](https://www.wideleft.football/p/the-death-of-neoliberalism-an-autopsy?open=false&ref=wheresyoured.at#%C2%A7what-is-neoliberalism) — corporations are bowed down to like gods, and the powerful only seek more, at all times, at all costs, even if said cost is “the company might eventually die because we’ve burned out any value it actually has” or “people are harmed every time they pick up their phone.” The Rot Economy is neoliberalism’s true innovation: a kind of economic cancer that with few reasons to exist beyond “more” and few justifications beyond “if we don’t let it keep growing then everybody’s pensions blow up.”
  To be clear, Cory is *for the most part right*. Enshittification successfully encapsulates how the modern web was destroyed in a way that nobody really has. I think it applies in a wide-ranging way to a wide range of tech companies and effects.
  I, however, believe the wider problem is bigger, and the costs are far greater. It isn’t that “everything is enshittified.” It’s that everybody’s pursuit of growth has changed the incentive behind how we generate value in the world, and software enables a specific kind of growth-lust by creating virtual nation states with their own digital despots. While laws may stop Meta from tearing up people’s houses surrounding its offices on 1 Hacker Way, it can happily reroute traffic and engagement on Facebook and Instagram to make things an iota more profitable.
  The Rot Economy isn’t simply growth-at-all-costs thinking — it’s a kind-of secular religion, something to believe in, that everything and anything can be more, should be more, *must* be more, that we are defined only by our pursuit of more growth, and that something that isn’t growing isn’t alive, and is in turn inferior.

    - **Note:** The rot economy and growth at all costs killing us
- These companies unleashed generative AI on the world — or, in the case of Microsoft, facilitated its ascendency — without any consideration of what that would mean for the Internet as an ecosystem. Their concerns were purely short-term. Fiscal. The result? [Over-leverage in an industry that has no real path to profitability](https://wheresyoured.at/godot-isnt-making-it?ref=wheresyoured.at), burning billions of dollars and the environment - both digital and otherwise - along with it.
  I’m not saying that this is how everybody thinks, but I am convinced that everybody is burdened by The Rot Economy, and that digital ecosystems allow the poison of growth to find new and more destructive ways to dilute a human being to a series of numbers that can be made to grow or contract in the pursuit of capital.
  Almost every corner of our lives has been turned into some sort of number, and increasing that number is important to us — bank account balances, sure, but also engagement numbers, followers, number of emails sent and received, open rates on newsletters, how many times something we’ve seen has been viewed, all numbers set by other people that we live our lives by while barely understanding what they mean. Human beings thrive on ways to define themselves, but metrics often rob us of our individuality. Products that boil us down to metrics are likely to fail to account for the true depth of anything they're capturing.
  > **Sidenote:** Here’s a good example: [in an internal document I reviewed from 2017, a Facebook engineer revealed that engagement on the platform had started to dive](https://www.wheresyoured.at/killingfacebook/#:~:text=In%202017%2C%20the%20document%20notes%20that%20engagement%20metrics%20started%20to%20dive%2C%20but%20the%20company%E2%80%99s%20focus%20on%20%E2%80%9CTime%20Spent%E2%80%9D%20meant%20that%20nobody%20noticed%20because%20the%20number%20that%20Mark%20Zuckerberg%20cared%20about%20went%20up%2C%20until%20the%20alarm%20was%20sound%20and%20Facebook%20moved%20to%20%E2%80%9CSessions.%E2%80%9D), but because the company had focused so much energy on time spent on the app as a metric, nobody had noticed (and yes, that’s a quote). Years of changes — the consequences of which were felt by billions of people — were made not based on using the product or talking to users, but a series of numbers that nobody had bothered to check mattered.
  The change in incentives toward driving more growth actively pushes out those with long-term thinking. It encourages hiring people who see growth as the driver of a company's success, and in turn investment, research and development into mechanisms for growth, which may sometimes be things that help you, but that isn't necessarily the reason they're doing it. Organisational culture and hiring stops prioritising people that fix customer problems, because that is neither the priority nor, sadly, how one makes a business continue to grow.
  We are all pushed toward growth — personal growth, professional growth, growth in our network and our societal status — and the terms of this growth are often set by platforms and media outlets that are, in turn, pursuing growth. And as I've discussed, the way the terms of our growth is framed is almost entirely through a digital ecosystem of warring intents and different ways of pursuing growth — some ethical, many not.
  Societal and cultural pressure is nothing new, but the ways we experience it are now elaborate and chaotic. Our relationships — professional, personal, and romantic — are processed through the funhouse mirror of the platforms, changing in ways both subtle and overt based on the signals we receive from the people we care about, each one twisted and processed through the lens of product managers and growth hackers. Changes to these platforms — even subtle ones — actively change the lives of billions of people, and it feels like we talk about it like being online is some hobbyist pursuit rather than something that many people do more than *seeing real people in the real world.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg9f01akmxtja00cn42se6pz))
