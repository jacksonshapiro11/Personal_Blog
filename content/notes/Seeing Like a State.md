### Highlights

- Local knowledge like craftsmanship requires a feeling that can’t be codified like a fire fighter or pilot you need to understand rules of thumb then apply them practically. You wouldn’t want someone to guide you up a mountain to have gone up other mountains not this one. You’d rather have the local tracker knowledge. Métis = local knowledge all knowledge is situational or ambiguity. Socrates believed Métis was in the conversations of the Socratic method that philosophy was in the conversations not the words. Practical knowledge weighs more that it works then how it works. Scientific knowledge is based on experiment and not this local knowledge the issue is some things can’t be fully quantified or are better learned through formal truths. The issue with this thinking is that it views everything as not solved through science as wrong when in reality it’s just another method or direction. Discover what works less contented with why it works vs science needs to know why and what isn’t a guiding principle. Going toward a world of bounded rationality and satisfying instead of a world of facts and data. The quest for global universally applicable truth being left in the stead of local knowledge. No science will prove the best way to climb a mountain all the time with 100% certainty you need nuance and exploration of uncertain. Sometimes it rains and you want to avoid areas that might be faster in the dry weather but lead to more risk of falling sometimes it’s hot and you want shade. Long nuance short determinism

    - **Note:** There is local knowledge and intuition applicable in all scenarios. Sometimes you do not need the best explanation just a good enough one. this is similar to Jeff Bezos decision making framework of important and reversible. When we look for global universal truth we miss nuance. This is interesting because there can be global universal truth but we cannot really know it in the bounds of our knowledge, so these local knowledge which amounts to heuristics are vital. The world is irreducibly complex and models simplify so we must miss nuance in that dimensionality reduction and that is the benefit of metis or local knowledge.
      Having a refined process but sometimes you need to jam the outcome and the process is a distant second.
      Commit to a path rebuttal of critical approach or maybe an amplification of it saying truth is impossible so we need verisimilitude. Importance of metis and be approx right vs exact wrong. Place in the world for both. Appreciate complexity
- High modernism was scientism not science instead of embracing the experimentation Gaines through local knowledge this was viewed as incorrect because it didn’t seem “scientific.” Blind faith in “science” trust the science. High modernism rejects practicality and local knowledge because it would
  1. reduce their importance as specialist’s
  2. They reject old science and believe the past is wrong and they should be right assumption past is bad
  3. Practical knowledge rejected because it can’t be scientifically proven
    - **Tags:** #histroical-knowledge, #scientism, #metis, #high-modernism, #faith-not-proof
    - **Note:** High modernism relied on what ought to be instead of what was. It took elegant and complicated over correct. It had faith in science which is an oxymoron
- In crop research high modernism looks to control for soil temperature ect but in these countries you cant and you need local knowledge to plan and maintain the fields. Crops also change the soil and soil conditions are different based on everything that happened like planting season recent weather village needs and ability to focus and spend time on the crops. Many complex factors that can’t be simply controlled for and simplified in a study to declare a sense of universal truth. Sometimes you might not want to grow the highest ev yield but one with low variance so you make sure you don’t go hungry

    - **Note:** People don’t realize that complex ecosystems don’t rely on point interventions but require system change and all factors have confounding factors and unintended consequences. There is always a trade off and you need to be careful what you’re optimizing for.
- People condemned things for aesthetic and not results things looked ugly so we’re viewed unfavorably but they actually had a ton of local knowledge that while looking wrong had a deeper sense of truth than the “ordered” method
    - **Tags:** #levels-of-emergence, #deep-complexity, #metis
    - **Note:** Some things at one level look ugly but reveal themselves at a higher level of order/complexity.
- High modernism is short sighted and so the outcomes that cannot be measured or are not trying to be measured and optimized don’t matter so important long term things like ecosystem construction and soil health are ignored for next quarter but then this build up and you get fucked. High level plans are inflexible and fragile

    - **Note:** High modernism looked to the next quarter because they were employees who didn't care for the future of the system. Over the long term the good of the system is aligned but there can be incentive mismatches in the short term. Ie sleeping in instead of going to the gym.
- Genetically uniform varieties are very good and productive and highly desirable when external conditions are favorable and plants are protected from pests of all kinds but when they are not favorable the results can be disastrous due to some new parasite
    - **Tags:** #systems-thinking, #diversity-(within-systems), #robust, #hidden-built-up-risks, #resilience-vs-stability
    - **Note:** This is an example of fragility vs diversity and the idea of stability vs robustness
- Plan cities or thin cities miss complexities and enhance fragility and then it generates a planned dark twin that does the opposite of what the state wants and fills in the gaps it left. The dark twin informs the exact city. Informal economy supplies what the formal economy cannot
    - **Tags:** #bottoms-up-not-top-down, #complex-adaptive-systems, #systems-thinking
    - **Note:** Plan cities gave rise to a second dark city that filled all the unmet needs of what the plan overlooked. You need to appreciate and understand complexities
- The mechanized farming was something both Soviet Russians and Americans shared for its simplistic and seductive believes but they didn’t realize that this was wrong and they were blindly believing the ideas of high modernism without caring about the results. High modernist ideologies provide high level for social arrangements but authoritarian states impose these beliefs. States want simplification and legibility.
    - **Tags:** #high-modernism, #truth-seeking-(vs-being-right), #critical-approach-(conjectures-and-refutations), #systems-thinking
    - **Note:** High modernism makes sense but doesn’t consider the system or remain critical so it fails. Decrees knowledge doesn’t investigate truth.
- Lecorbusier and Lenin were big advocates of high modernism they saw the world as something to be solved and simplified. High level organization and a over simplification religion of scientism. Cost in centralized hierarchy is loss in creativity from below. Saw people through the lens of complexity one centralized actor could not control or properly drive the will of the party because they just couldn’t understand or know. Bottoms up vs top down.

    - **Note:** Many high modernist approaches were top down you need the hedgehog and the fox and the humility to accept you need both. Perspective and humility is vital.
- What kinds of tasks are the new form of production or creation of revolution. This comes from a stochastic process of approximation and adjustment of learning and growing with those who have the local knowledge able to influence the process. Cannot be blue prints or high level decrees but local. Not deductive first principal knowledge but knowledge that comes from similar but not identical tasks over time adapts to changing circumstances. The people are irrelevant they are seen more as units to be used as simplification and start with “known truths” Luxembourg and colentia see the world as confusing and messy and aim to get closer to the truth over time through trial error and many experiments. No distinction between means and ends. Not setting goals but designing a system
    - **Tags:** #complex-adaptive-systems, #metis, #failure-(as-a-necessary-part-of-learning), #bottoms-up-not-top-down, #systems-thinking
    - **Note:** The world is a complex adaptive system and as much as you would like to plan and understand it; it's often an iterative and messy process that requires a lot of failure and learning. Design a thoughtful system and adjust as it runs.
      Design intelligent systems that appreciate complexity and metis
- Jane Jacob’s sees cities as chaotic order. The mixed use of things makes it better. The shop keeper creates foot traffic which creates more eyes which creates more safety which draws more people which creates more traffic. The lecorbusier view of order was single use things that could be calculated but you lost the value in interaction between things that lead to the success of neighborhoods like the north end in Boston. Complex order and interplay lead to a better more organized fruitful society. In the projects of high modernism there was no community no watch not safety. The danger in formulas is they give you and answer but this answer is biased by the formula. Safety is nice but it’s not always accurate. Danger in clean formulas you don’t check your assumptions.

    - **Note:** Knowledge in complex systems lies in the connections as much as any one thing. You cannot optimize at a point you need to consider the whole system. Models are seductive but often have major blind spots that we lower our guard for because we trust them and they look good.
- Lecorbusier sees order from above Jacobs begins with social order from the ground. The city is alive and diversity is vital to the neighborhood thriving. Planners assume people know what they want but often this is very difficult and it’s hard to be sure you’re right. City planning should go long the unplanned complexity and randomness and short high level planning. Planning usually hurts because it fits a round peg into a square hole. Emphasis of change renewal and innovation
    - **Tags:** #cities, #metis, #complex-adaptive-systems, #diversity-(within-systems), #bottoms-up-not-top-down, #post-modernist-thinking, #self-organizing-system
    - **Note:** City planning should create complexity and bottom up order not top down rules. Renewal and innovation not square peg in round holes. Diversity over all.
- Most complex systems don’t show a surface regularity must find a deeper order. Mistake made was assuming functional from visual order when complex systems don’t do this. To see comes systems as order and not chaos requires a deep understanding. Seeing things like an airplane engine look like chaos but once you see the system function you realize the deep order

    - **Note:** Surface vs complex order. A complex system may appear chaotic at one level of emergence but at a higher level it’s very clear. What one person does in a day is unpredictable but what the organizational goal is governs much behavior. Take the systems view.
      Functional to visual order is skewmorphic analysis.
- Le Corbusier wanted everything to be set up and structured. Did not want buildings built for multiple purposes but one. Wanted order and regularity. City demands many different uses but Le Corbusier wants to build the kitchen just for cooking not for eating and socializing. Splitting cars and sidewalks from areas where people live. Split the essence of living from a few high level functions and believed his way was the right true way. Missed all nuance. Thought his beliefs were scientific. Believed there was one correct way to make a city and everything else was wrong and evil. World ruled by hierarchy and truth not messiness and complexity. Believed he was right and wanted to indoctrinate people into his way of thinking

    - **Note:** Le Corbusier saw the world as functions not as a dynamic system. Built things for a single use purpose with no nuance when in reality things like streets and sidewalks are more than places for cars and people to travel but to interaction. He believed in his science which was flawed. What is the difference between a visionary and a zealot is a zealot a visionary who is wrong? He failed because he was mentally inflexible and more of a religious leader than anything. The world isnt functions but interactions. Life is a process.
      multiple true meanings and belief he was right without questioning it. Connectionist vs reductionist. Have a vision adjust to the world.
      He thought life could be reduced but it can’t. The world is irreducibly complex
- State needs hubris to achieve lofty goals fine grain administrative grid with strong state machinery and coversive power over citizens they could master. Combo of administrative ordering of nature and society high modernist aspiration to shape the world and believe you were right envisioned sweeping rational engineering of social reform and life to improve human condition. 2nd aspect is unrestrained power of the state to act on their beliefs. 3rd is a weak society that accepts rule can’t resist.

    - **Note:** The state succeeds because of their overwhelming power and ability to cast their will onto a population. Agency to shape the world.
- Need high modernism provides the desire. Power provides the means to act. Civil society provides the smooth terrain to build
  Enlightenment belief of social world as scientific as physics and that it could be shaped by “modernism.”
    - **Tags:** #high-modernism, #power, #malleable-world
- This belief starts from the idea that they are right everything they don’t believe is wrong and they need to shape nature to fit their beliefs whether that is the environment or people in a society or family structure.
    - **Tags:** #belief-proceeds-achievement, #high-modernism
    - **Note:** The high modernist approach of knowing their right then implementing their beliefs without questioning them
- The people who most stood to benefit were the social and bureaucratic elites who designed the system but this system was not wholly bad as progress has been resisted throughout the years for bad reasons not evil motives per say
    - **Tags:** #power-in-the-real-world, #system-construction
- States created last names as a way to classify people. People generally had local names that changed over time. State naming was a way to measure specific people so they could be counted fed taxed and conscripted and was met by popular resistance. The state values legibility needs to make the world legible. Standardize language get rid of local languages or knowledge to increase the value of the state. State reward compliance penalized dissent
    - **Tags:** #emergent-behavior, #levels-of-emergence, #metis, #legibility, #bottoms-up-and-top-down
    - **Note:** The state wants legibility and to destroy nuance because they operate at a higher level of abstraction
- The state sees simplified versions to see large and complex reality which allows the state to see more and further. The state simplifies to make legible and misses some nuance the state must see big picture but it gets dangerous when the state gets too prescriptive because without local knowledge these initiatives struggle to do good and sweeping policy is hard. At high level the state can see the cases of tuberculosis by income. These simplifications are not irrelevant they are valuable from a different lens or perspective see from a different vantage point. Value standardization over accuracy because if you can’t reproduce it it’s value to the state is low. States take the messy and complex and make it neat and ordered. Shape people and map the territory to their techniques of observation as well. Not just describe observe and map
    - **Tags:** #map-is-not-the-territory, #metis, #bottoms-up-and-top-down, #levels-of-emergence, #standardization-vs-accuracy, #favorite, #compression-algorithm, #information-loss, #nuance, #irreducable-complexity
    - **Note:** States accomplish great things by simplifying complexity and losing some accuracy this trade off is clear but when it gets overly prescriptive thinking it has the nuance it’s clearly missing that’s when issues arise. The state is a compression algorithm which is beneficial but you need to respect the information loss and be less prescriptive
- Hedgehog one big thing
  Fox many little things
  Hedgehog sees the world through one lens of something. For example the surveyors see the land for area the only thing that can be accurately measured but the people who live there are foxes they realize they are close to a market which is more valuable but most of the land is infertile while the plot down the road is half the size but is closer to the water and fully fertile. The state sees area but the people live intricacies. Hedgehog sees thing more narrower but they see more high level as well. Good time to be both. Seeing the forest for the trees and through the trees.
  State wants order even when it doesn’t fit so it can measure even if it’s not wholly accurate

    - **Note:** The hedgehog vs the fox is a great lesson in levels of emergence and perspective taking. Sometimes you need the top down view other times you need to local knowledge you need to balance the two. You need to view a system as both top down and bottom up but this is very difficult to do.
- Measurement was non standard and people used this to their advantage while a loaf of break or sack of grain always had the same price the size of the loaf or how the sack was filled changed slightly timing was measured in the time it took people to cook local rice in short very non standard practices and this lead to the state not knowing much about how much they could tax or their output so they came up with systems like the metric system and universal timing to quantify things. Land wasn’t measured by acre but by how fertile it would be. Land that was implantable was viewed differently from rich non rocky land

    - **Note:** State needs to simplify or else you have a tragedy of the commons effect where everyone is incentivized to lie and kill the spirit not the letter of the law. The issue with top down is you lose nuance which is important.
- In this standardization people went from feudal citizens to national citizens. Instead of being from a village you were “French”. Further standardization. At the beginning much of these standardization measures were not used by people but only the courts and schools. Generally looked down upon
    - **Tags:** #simplicity-(power-of), #reductionist, #top-down-view, #controlling-others
    - **Note:** States want simplification. This gives them reach with massive reduction.
- States take a Forrest and measures it as trees that are equal to timber animals you can eat becomes game animals you can’t eat are pests. Plants you can eat are crops those you can’t weeds. Ignores complexity for output sees the forest for the trees but not the complexity ecosystem it can’t codify “scientific forestry”. Don’t see complexity. Calculate generic revenue per area of forest and then use how much they can harvest of the forest in order to project revenue forward.
    - **Tags:** #high-modernism, #complex-adaptive-systems, #scientism, #irreducable-complexity, #scientific-forestry
    - **Note:** This is an example of irreducible complexity and the issues with high modernist thinking and scientism.
- Germany created forestry science but this missed the point prioritized the short term output but hid fragilities. Eventually as the forest matured the lack of diversity was its downfall and the trees struggled to grow due to nutrient issues
    - **Tags:** #hidden-built-up-risks, #complex-adaptive-systems, #system-construction, #systems-thinking, #robust, #fragility-in-systems, #resilience-vs-stability, #definitions
    - **Note:** The importance of considering the system and diversity instead of creating high output that leads to lower long term output. This is a definition of resilience vs stability and fragility and hidden risks.
- Can’t dismember a complex ecosystem to optimize for one output leads to ultimate failure. Different trees have different strengths and having a monoculture forest instead of optionality lead to the downfall

    - **Note:** Complex ecosystems create relationships that may be unclear in the moment but reveal the importance of interactions over time. You can't simplify a complex ecosystem
      Irreducible complexity
- The state wants to count and quantify people with censuses last names ect to measure productivity and leavy taxes. 4 things that usually lead to a failure in state craft
    - **Tags:** #top-down-view, #macro-trends, #metis
    - **Note:** States wants to make people visable
- High modern ideology control of nature understanding of human needs rational design of social order based on “laws” borrows science and is uncritical unskeptical and ultimately unscientific. More a religion than a science. Use state power to create uptopia
    - **Tags:** #post-modernist-thinking, #scientism, #irreducable-complexity, #critical-approach-(conjectures-and-refutations), #visionary-vs-zealot, #bottoms-up-not-top-down, #first-principles-thinking
    - **Note:** The issues with the high modernist approach is it assumes its right and uses science that should work but ultimately doesn't because the base thinking is wrong. Religion over science
- Authoritarian state that brings these ideas into action without any collaboration from the people
  Civil society that cannot resist the authoritarian state
  Legibility provides capacity for large scale social engineering.
  High modernism provides the desire.
  The authoritarian state provides the ability to act on the desire.
  The civil society that doesn’t fight back provides the land to build on
  These fail because there are many simplified rules that miss the intricates and complexity of society and are unable to deal with them and fail as a result. Need local/ practical knowledge and know how in order to come together with state plans to form a strong foundation of a new society
  Mutuality in social and natural order. Complex order is tough to codify
    - **Tags:** #high-modernism, #metis, #complex-adaptive-systems, #nuance, #bottoms-up-not-top-down, #state-vs-individual-power, #legibility
    - **Note:** The high modernist ideology seeks to exert its authoritarian top down power on the tofu that is the people and the state by making everything more legible and manipulate it, but this leads them to understand the complexity at the local level that drives a lot of innovation in the world. The state vs complexity is a big fight
      You need the power to exercise.
- This book is about local vs state knowledge and the issues with high modernism. The state and the people have competing incentive structures which leads to core incentive misalignment and this leads to differing system design. However, there is a flaw in the state method because the natural constraints of top down organizations versus bottom up organic systems. The State will try to stateify the territory it controls because if it does not make this legible the state’s power over it dwindles. The state workers as employees and not owners leads to a time horizon mismatch as well. States
    - **Tags:** #high-modernism, #employees-vs-customers-(run-by-employees), #incentive-structures, #bottoms-up-not-top-down
    - **Note:** States are big top down entities that want to increase legibility and this goes counter to the bottom up emergent world. The state is run by employees not owners or customers.
- This book is generally about incentive misalignment and hubris. The high modernist approach assumes its correct and its critics are stupid, but it misses all the nuance. It has the same issue the nail factory had when it made millions of tiny unusable nails. Likewise, when you are optimizing for one thing you get lost in the local system knowledge that you need. If you want a sherpa to help you climb a mountain, you would like them to have experience on this mountain not other mountains. Because all answers are situation dependent. The best path for the climb is different in the heat, cold, rain, snow, ect. A high modernist approach might say this is the best way, but the metis of the local sees this is an older group and realizes the “best” way will be 2x harder and likely take longer. Complexity is often rejected due to lack of order, but this is the opposite of the truth. Order is chaos and complexity is deep order. The beautiful scientific forests were monocrop fragility disasters that destroyed ecosystems while the original disordered forest was actually a complex ecosystem that needed predators and pray parasites and pests. There is no greater danger in knowing youre right because at this point you are most likely wrong. Things are not infinitely reducable and eventually the nuance of a usecase is lost. A street is not meant for living or working or eatings or socializing. It is for all of those things. When a street becomes only about one of those its value disintegrates.

    - **Note:** Goodheart Law when the measure becomes the process you overoptimize and the measure is useless. High modern assumes it right but the issue is that things are more complex than they appear. Life is a process, not a thing the world is more complex and there is never one answer. There is just working within the system and different optimizations with trade-offs that require system. Based knowledge not just scientific fact.

    - **Note:** Le corbusier saw the world as top down when it is really bottom up and emergent. His top down defined ideas created more harm than good and was ultimately very wrong.
