- You had one simple idea and took it seriously genius has the fewest moving parts. His career was built around the idea that Europe had great art, and America had rich people and he bridged bringing the great art to sell it to the rich people in America and that’s simple idea what his entire career , he knew everything about his clients and with his cleverness like if they needed help staying somewhere in Europe, he would conveniently have a bunch of nice art on the walls that may or may not be for sale genius but hidden so it’s not in your face. Enthusiasm you have for your product please and bleeds into other people. Each picture was the greatest he had to sell since the last one and until the next one. When he would meet with people he’d fully rehearse the interview so it seemed natural and spur of the moment but it was heavily calculated. Duvine created scarcity by controlling supply he had 1 great piece but 10 clients bidding creating a mental bidding war.

    - **Note:** He took a very simple idea very seriously. He knew everything and did the work but made other people think it was a coincidence so they would seems smart or it would feel like a coincidence. He would rehearse so it seemed natural when it was calculated. Enthusiasm you have for your product please and bleeds into other people. He created the idea of scarcity to drive up prices
- Duvene had great informational advantage knowing which customers in the us were buying and which rich customers in Europe needed to sell. Price as a signal for quality he would bid himself up and offer the most of anyone because then he could charge more to his clients. A woman asked him for 18k he told her it was worth 25k and he was the buyer. He cultivated relationships and mistique from the buyer and seller playing top dollar to drive his brand halo. His enthusiasm about his products were contagious. He had 8-10 clients and was always selling he built a beautiful 5th ave show room he was selling status from the European nobility to the neuvo riche in the US who had money not status. Deep focus and control of his customers. When he went to Europe he would stay at the 4 seasons and decorate his hotel room with paintings to sell. He was trying to sell 3 busts to Rockefeller jr. He wanted 1.5mm vs 1mm offered. He allowed him to keep the busts in his house for a year before he had to buy it forget his option but the price never changed. On the 2nd to last day after much resistance he bought them. ([Time 0:14:13](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6d02f546-b293-4710-8368-b2dd860f1ef7))

    - **Note:** He created a 2 sided marketplace that was himself. Price as a signal. He cultivated relationships and desire to create a brand halo. His enthusiasm was contagious. He had a few clients he relentlessly focused on selling status to. He was always selling always working deep focus and commitment
- Dueve created a monopoly he would control all the supply when rival art dealers were bidding he’d outbid then his record purchases and sales would be written in the papers further advertising. He would say you can buy as many 50k painting as you want but there are only so many 250k paintings. He cultivated scarcity and he was the only guy with the supply if you were offered something and didn’t buy it it could be sold the next day creating fomo. He would buy things not sold for 200 years. Scarcity and creating fomo. His enthusiasm was palatable he was not only buying great works but educating customers on them. He talked about his failures to hide his genius. He was laser focused only on his business. Had the best information. Monopoly was his method he knew everything and had relationships sold Mellon 95 of 115 paintings. He had fabricated coincidences he paid deck hands hundreds of dollars to get situated next to rich Americans on trans Atlantic ships. Finds the leverage point. One man he took to buckongham palace walked in the front door then showed him the art collections of many of his friends he had sold to never mentioned he sold or had a collection until 3 years in when the man begged to buy something from him. Duvene took him to see his collection in nyc said none of the paintings were for sale but maybe he could have a sculture the man spent 5mm. Playing the only game cultivating desire.

    - **Note:** Duveen was an expert in cultivating desire and being a monopoly business. He sold painting not sold for 200 years created fomo and overpaid so his competitors didn’t get any good paintings. Him selling it was a brand in itself. Created scarcity fomo leading to desire. He was a genius and manufactured coincidences so he could meet new people. Took the Ferrari model of not selling in order to sell and let the newspapers printing his sales be his free advertising. Had deep enthusiasm too. Always in the right position to make a sale.

  Speaker 1
  And so Duvene had a conviction that anyone who worked for him, high or low, should be compensated in a manner, commiserate, with the dignity of the association with him, right? I am the best in the world. Everybody associated with me has to be the best, and they should be paid like the best. He finds his main restore. So this the people that have to, you know, take these very old paintings, you know, spruce them up for lack of a better word. There is this guy named Stephen Pacheto. Pacheto was Duvene's main restore, right? He's moving so much product as Duvene's business grows, so does Pacheto's. And this is the end result when Pacheto died in 1949 at the age of 61, he was himself a wealthy man. Such was a trade as Duvene practiced it, that even a restore who worked for Duvene could leave a fortune. Now a large part of this profile is the founding of something that still is available actually to us today. It's the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., which was established in 1937. You can go there to this day and visit it for free. Over 3 million people a year do just that. That is an idea from Joseph Duvene. So I'm actually going to read the summary about the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. ([Time 0:40:23](https://share.snipd.com/snip/42ce1b7a-265f-4fed-af04-9dee4f1245ea))
    - **Note:** He created relationships with service people and butlers paying them hundred K and treated his people extremely well so his restore was the best thing got paid the best and died to wealthy man and paying all these people so much compounded his information advantage because they felt they had to tell him things, so he knew all about his clients lives, and was what was going on with them. All the problems that came up were how can I use this to sell more art. He created a public gallery in 1930s so people didn’t have to worry about inheritance taxes could look like benefactors and could buy more art. They donated their works to these galleries. Duvene told people art was better than money his customers felt better when they paid more. Moderate prices were fatal. Duvene would offer what was 20k for 250k made people want it. All his interactions were carefully planned he studied key clients then would run into them being tipped off by a butler and spend the day with them. He once bought a collection out from under another guy then sold it to that same guy for millions more. He cultivated desire and fomo and his brand had so much power. He sold things for more because it was perceived higher quality people only want the best.
