  I want to go back to a couple words in that sentence. I think it's extremely important. This is my attempt to enter a dialogue the way I describe when you sit down and whether you read this autobiography or any of the other autobiographies that you and I have talked about on this podcast, what you're doing at the time is you're having a one-sided conversation with one of history's greatest entrepreneurs. It is one of the highest value ways to spend your time. This is also an exposition of a business. This is also why I love him too. I absolutely love, I love his stubbornness. I love how difficult he is. I love the fact that he knows exactly what he wants to do in life and he does not allow anybody, anybody to convince him to deviate from that path. This is also the exposition of a business philosophy which is very different from anything you might have encountered before. The thing about this philosophy is it wasn't conceived by a businessman and it has worked. It is said that to be an overnight success takes years of effort. So it has proved with me. That's the entire book. That is why it's so valuable. You read this book and you'll think about it two years, three years, five years from now, you're going through an unbelievable, difficult part of building your business or your life like James didn't give up. All right, I got knocked down. I'm going, I'm getting back up. That's so important. There were 20 years of debt. Four years ago, I came out of the dark and now I had a company turning over hundreds of millions a year. Most bizarrely, it has all happened rather without anybody noticing. ([Time 0:07:23](https://share.snipd.com/snip/435ce545-81a7-4777-8459-32f61cadb9bb))
    - **Note:** Overnight success over decades never gave up on his dream relentless
- James Dyson's Anti-Business Philosophy and Obsession with Product Quality
  Summary:
  James Dyson is a billionaire with an anti-business philosophy. Steve Jobs and Yvonne Schonard are also billionaires who focus on quality of their products. If you focus on making an excellent product and you maintain control, you'll wind up with the money anyways," says David Frum.

  You read this book and you'll think about it two years, three years, five years from now, you're going through an unbelievable, difficult part of building your business or your life like James didn't give up. All right, I got knocked down. I'm going, I'm getting back up. That's so important. There were 20 years of debt. Four years ago, I came out of the dark and now I had a company turning over hundreds of millions a year. Most bizarrely, it has all happened rather without anybody noticing. And then he tells us why he believes this all happened. It's the excellence of the product. Really, if you think about his philosophy, he's a very anti-business philosophy. It's going to sound very familiar to what we covered last week on the Steve Jobs episode. I would say this anti-business philosophy that James Dyson has. It reminds me of Steve Jobs. It reminds me of Yvonne Schonard and it comes down to the fact that these guys are unbelievably obsessed with the quality of the product that they're making. It reminds me of what Henry Ford said. One of my favorite quotes from the history of entrepreneurship, money comes naturally as a result of service. If you focus on making an excellent product and you maintain control, you'll wind up with the money anyways. Steve Jobs, James Dyson, Yvonne Schonard, these are anti-business billionaires. It has all happened, I really believe because of the intrinsic excellence of the machine. Because it is a better vacuum cleaner than anything that has gone before and because it looks better than anything like it has ever looked. ([Time 0:08:22](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3e76c7cb-d76d-46e2-980c-ac3a43edc40e))
    - **Note:** Money comes naturally as a result of service of you make an excellent product the money comes naturally
- Money Comes Naturally as a Result of Service
  Key takeaways:
  - Money comes naturally as a result of service
  - Intrinsic excellence of the product is key for success in entrepreneurship
  - Unexpected individuals can make significant contributions in business despite lacking formal qualifications
  - Vacuum cleaner industry remained unchanged for a century before disruption

  It reminds me of what Henry Ford said. One of my favorite quotes from the history of entrepreneurship, money comes naturally as a result of service. If you focus on making an excellent product and you maintain control, you'll wind up with the money anyways. Steve Jobs, James Dyson, Yvonne Schonard, these are anti-business billionaires. It has all happened, I really believe because of the intrinsic excellence of the machine. Because it is a better vacuum cleaner than anything that has gone before and because it looks better than anything like it has ever looked. And then he goes into the fact that he was very unlikely that he was the one that was going to do this because the vacuum cleaner, he goes through the history of the vacuum cleaner in the book. I'm going to skip over a lot of that. But this could be an idea. The vacuum cleaner for a hundred years remained essentially unchanged. If anyone was going to step in and shake this up a bit, it was very unlikely to be me. I wasn't even a qualified engineer. And yet that is how it turned out. I own it exclusively. And with it, you might say the key to every household in the developed world. And this is the first time he brings up two things that he repeats throughout the book. First, he thinks of himself primarily as a designer. Design is where his heart is, right? The second thing is get this idea out of your mind that you need some kind of formal education to build wonderful products. So he says the first thing to forget is any notion that you have to be a qualified engineer to make an impact on engineering. I fiddled with wood for a while, then I got into plastic and drifted into product design. Convinced that engineering was no more than a state of mind and determined to develop the products I was designing technology technologically, as well as visually, I began to moonlight as a professional. The look of the product, the intangible style that sets one thing apart from another is still closest to my heart. ([Time 0:09:09](https://share.snipd.com/snip/207d6093-5a90-4187-a847-3f238c88b5ab))
    - **Note:** He was uniquely positioned not to do this. He had little formal training but he just didn’t believe the haters. Believe in yourself.

  Convinced that engineering was no more than a state of mind and determined to develop the products I was designing technology technologically, as well as visually, I began to moonlight as a professional. The look of the product, the intangible style that sets one thing apart from another is still closest to my heart. And then he speaks about this really important design principle he uses his entire life that comes from the fact that James, like every single other person that you and I talk about studied the great people and the great work that came before them. And we see this here. James was the one who introduced me to this guy with the crazy name, right, who was unbelievably well known and famous in his day, just alive, you know, 150 years ago, whatever it was, Isambard Kingdom Brunel. So the last time I covered this book, it was episode 200, then reading about James' affinity for Brunel, I went and found a biography of Brunel and immediately read it. So if you want to learn about the guy that James studied, I made an episode 201 where you can you can learn from him. Actually, you know what, I'm going to read. I'm going to read one of my favorite quotes from that biography in one second. So it says, it is only by remaining as close as possible to the pure function of the object that beauty can be achieved. My greatest hero was always Isambard Kingdom Brunel, whose inverted, catenary curve was crucial to the structure of his bridges and gave them the distinct stylistic power that still wows onlookers today. So you and I are going to talk about Isambard Kingdom Brunel a few times today. But I need to read this to you because James, when you if you read this book, should I read, obviously we're only a couple pages into the introduction, he's unapologetically extreme, has unbelievably high standards for excellence for the excellence of the company's building and the product he's building. And Brunel was the same way. And so listen to how this is a letter that was published in Brunel's biography. It was a letter he wrote to one of his employees that was not living up to his unbelievably high standards. And so Brunel writes, plain, gentlemanly language seems to have no effect upon you. I must try stronger language and stronger measures. You are a cursed, lazy, inattentive, apathetic vagabond. And if you continue to neglect my instructions and to show such infernal laziness, I shall send you about your business. I have frequently told you, amongst other absurd, untidy habits, that that of making drawings on the back of others was inconvenient. By your cursed neglect of that, you have again wasted more of my time than your whole life is worth. ([Time 0:10:27](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2085d72d-8bd0-4618-9ad0-ab76592ed76b))
    - **Note:** Keep your product as close to pure function as possible. Hated the lazy. Had crazy high standard for people.
- Unapologetically Extreme Standards: A Letter from Brunel
  Key takeaways:
  - The speaker is discussing a book with high standards for excellence in building a company and product.
  - The speaker shares an extreme letter written by Brunel to an employee not living up to standards.
  - Brunel was known for having high expectations and used strong language and measures to enforce them.
  - Learning by avoiding negative consequences is emphasized.

  But I need to read this to you because James, when you if you read this book, should I read, obviously we're only a couple pages into the introduction, he's unapologetically extreme, has unbelievably high standards for excellence for the excellence of the company's building and the product he's building. And Brunel was the same way. And so listen to how this is a letter that was published in Brunel's biography.

I have frequently told you, amongst other absurd, untidy habits, that that of making drawings on the back of others was inconvenient. By your cursed neglect of that, you have again wasted more of my time than your whole life is worth. So then James goes back to this idea on the importance of learning by doing. My own success has been observing objects in daily use, which it was always assumed could not be improved. By lateral thinking, which he calls the Edisonian approach. So another one of his heroes and somebody he talks about over and over again in this book is his admiration for Thomas Edison. It is possible to arrive empirically at an advance. Anyone can become an expert in anything in six months. After the idea, there's plenty of time to learn the technology. ([Time 0:11:53](https://share.snipd.com/snip/49c3114f-5712-4a92-a03d-0305c9388221))
    - **Note:** Learning by doing. Anyone can become an expert in something in 6 months. Lateral thinking.
- Becoming an expert in anything in six months: Lessons for aspiring inventors
  Summary:
  Anyone can become an expert in anything in six months. After the idea, there's plenty of time to learn the technology. And then we'll wrap up the introduction before we go into his early life. The best kind of business is one where you can sell a product at a high price with a good margin and an enormous volumes. For that, you have to develop a product that works better and looks better than existing ones. That type of investment is long term and high risk, or at least it looks like a high risk policy. In the longer view, it is not half so likely to prove hazardous to one's financial health as simply following the herd. I think great advice to you

  Anyone can become an expert in anything in six months. After the idea, there's plenty of time to learn the technology. My first cyclonic vacuum cleaner was built out of cereal packets and masking tape long before I understood how it worked. And this is funny too, because from that time, from the first idea, that first prototype until he actually makes money on it, it's going to be about 13 years, the greatest lesson for aspiring inventors was yet to come. The actual making of money, paper stuff and thick wads, which they finally give to you because you've done something good. And then we'll wrap up the introduction before we go into his early life. And inside the end of the introduction is about a five sentence summary of the book, which I'll get to in one second. The best kind of business is one where you can sell a product at a high price with a good margin and an enormous volumes. For that, you have to develop a product that works better and looks better than existing ones. That type of investment is long term and high risk, or at least it looks like a high risk policy. In the longer view, it is not half so likely to prove hazardous to one's financial health as simply following the herd. This is the beginning of what I consider a five sentence summary of James' thought process and what he's trying to basically teach you and I. Difference for the sake of it in everything because it must be better from the moment the idea strikes to the running of the business, difference and retention of total control, that last sentence being the most important, different to James. And I think great advice to you and I, difference and retention of total control. This is not even a business book. ([Time 0:13:15](https://share.snipd.com/snip/958fbec9-905c-4fcc-a73d-cdd4fc7df43d))
    - **Note:** Differece for the sake of it and total control. Differentiation is survival.
- The Impact of Fatherhood: Lessons from James Taylor's Autobiography
  Key takeaways:
  - James Altucher's father's death had a significant impact on him that lasted for decades
  - The passage is a reminder of how important parents are to their children
  - The impact parents have on their children can last long after they're gone
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  This is devastating on episode 205, you know, he's what 75, 76, something like that writing that book. His father's going to die from cancer when James is nine, right? So over 60 years later in his second autobiography, he's still talking about the impact that his father's death had on him. And so what I think was like from our vantage point, it's a reminder to how important we are to our kids and to take that job as a father and mother don't take that job lightly because long many decades after you're gone, the impact that you have on your children will still be resonating. Listen to this, my father died of cancer in 1956. I was only nine at the time. His death put me at a great disadvantage compared to the other boys. It made me feel like an underdog, someone who was always going to have things taken away from him. It made me feel that I was alone in this world. I had no one to help me through my boyish problems and no one to cite his own useful experiences and as an example to me, when I thought I might be troubled by something no one else had ever been through before, life became something I had to make up as I went along and I had to work everything out for myself. I suppose it made me a fighter. It also made me very competitive. And so the great thing about rereading this book so much is now that I get to see my past highlights, but I also get to see my past notes that I have not thought about or maybe even forgotten. And so you get to this point where he's essentially saying, hey, I'm going to learn from my dad's experience and I'm going to make a vow to myself to not wait to do work that I love. And I'm going to read this to you. Let me read James's words and then I'll read the note that I left, you know, two years ago when I read this book at the time of his death. So his dad was a teacher. But what he really wanted to do was be an actor and to produce plays. And so it says at the time of his death, he had been about to join BBC television, but his move to change careers came too late. Seeing him thwarted by death in that way, having done something else for so long made me determine that that should never happen to me. I would not be dragged into something I didn't want to do. I double underline that. It's really important not only for the book to understand James, but I think as a reminder to you and I, I would not be dragged into something I did not want to do. And so the note I left myself a few years ago when I read this book, it says from the Jim Carrey quote that you can fail at what you don't want to do. So you might as well take a chance at doing what you love. ([Time 0:15:59](https://share.snipd.com/snip/294f3424-723e-4657-9ccc-ad93ba085028))
    - **Note:** His fathers early death made him force himself to think and act for himself because he had no teacher. His dad wanted to be in entertainment and by the time he took his shot he had cancer. Do what you love
- The Power of Training Alone: How One Athlete Found Success
  Key takeaways:
  - Herb Elliot's coach advised him to run up and down sand dunes to develop stamina and strengthen leg muscles, which helped him beat his competitors
  - The speaker, inspired by Elliot's story, also began running up and down sand dunes and developed an extreme work ethic
  - The speaker found motivation in doing something that no one else was doing
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  There was no dad to tell me how great I was. And I it became a very introverted kind of obsession with me. Herb Elliot was a big name at the time. He's a runner. So I read a few books about him and discovered that his coach had told him that the way he developed stamina and strengthened the leg muscles was to run up and down sand dunes. So he had been doing this. He'd been training himself. He's doing something. He found an idea in a book that none of his competitors knew about. He starts doing it and he starts kicking their asses. I would get up at six in the morning and run for hours. He'd also do this. So his work ethic is also extreme. So he's running at six in the morning and then he'd go back out running 10 o'clock a night and not reappear back home until after midnight. Out there alone on the dunes, I got a terrific buzz from knowing that I was doing something that no one else was. They were all tucked up in bed. I knew that I was training myself to do something better than anyone else would do. I was out there learning how to do something and getting a visible result. The act of running itself was not something I enjoyed. The best you could say was that it was lonely and painful. But as I started to win by greater and greater margins, I did it more and more. He is not talking. He's technically talking about running. This is a metaphor for his career though. Listen to what he's going to say. I started to win by greater and greater margin. I did it more and more because I knew the reason for my success was out there on the sand dunes. I was doing something that no one else was doing. Apart from me and Herb, no one knew. They were all running around and around the track like a herd of sheep and not getting any quicker. Difference itself was making me come in first. This entire story, this decade and a half of struggle is him running into people that are incapable of thinking. The equivalent of them running around in tracks is like they think in tracks too. He talks about this. Most people are incapable of having an understanding of anything that's different from their current environment or their current business or their current idea. James was obviously able to step apart and say, hey, I have a better idea. You guys just can't see it. Okay, I'll just do it myself, which is the main theme of the book. In so many ways, this taught me the most significant lessons of all my youth. I was learning about the physical and psychological strength that keeps you competitive. I was learning about obstinency. I was learning how to overcome nerves. ([Time 0:21:22](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a91048cd-e8c7-4893-9beb-4e0ab9a88335))
    - **Note:** He started running and read a book of a great runner who would run on Sand dunes. James would do it at 6 am and 10 pm. Crush his competition do what your competition isn’t doing. He got joy out of this pain from his victory. Crazy work ethic. Physical and psychological strength to win.
- The Power of Learning from Masters
  Key takeaways:
  - Learning from masters can positively brainwash oneself with ideas, leading to perseverance.
  - Encountering difficulties and self-doubt can be overcome by looking to the examples of others who have persevered before.
  - Difficulties are inevitable, even when things are going well over the long term.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And this is a sentence that made me jot down like this is the why, right? Like we, the why behind what you and I getting together every week and having these conversations, we're sitting at the feet of masters and learning from them. And what happens is like these ideas get into your brain. Like we're bright, we're positively brainwashing ourselves. And then like they're just going to fire you on. Like it is inevitable that you and I are going to run into all kinds of problems, roadblocks, whatever, even when things are going really, really well, eventually something's going to happen over the long term, right? And just like a young James Dyson's like, man, no one Brunel's story fired me up. It gave me the fuel to persevere through a decade and a half of terrible like just straight agony. I have tried to be as confident in my vision as he was. And at times in my life, when I have encountered difficulty and self doubt, I have looked to his example to fire me on when I was deeply in debt. And the dual cycle looked as if it might remain a drawing board dream. I thought of his father, Mark Brunel, who spent time in debtor's prison and seemed destined for failure. When I have considered relinquishing total control. Remember his whole thing about the book. I'm going to pause right here because it's really important difference and retention of total control. He's going to tell you, it's like you can make a product, you can sell it, you can manufacture yourself, just control it. ([Time 0:27:43](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a59517cd-4cdf-481a-bb34-c78c879d1b3e))
    - **Note:** Positive brainwashing from history’s greatest founders.
- Two Crucial Business Lessons: Invest in Early Stage and Offer High Tech Specificity
  Key takeaways:
  - Invest in the early stages of a project
  - Don't sell a half-finished product
  - People want high-tech specificity, not all-purpose products
  - Present products based on customer needs not a one-size-fits-all approach
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Start of any project you embark on so don't stint on investment in the early stages once you finally convinces them to put on the cabin which he's been telling for a long time his sales wind up taking off like think about how much missed opportunity we had trying to sell these things and use that money and like just essentially don't sell a half finished product the second crucial business lesson that he uses later on in his career is that people do not want all purpose they want high tech specificity so you could make the sea truck or the sea truck for all kinds of things people use them in war people use them construction people use them all kinds of stuff and so this is the mistake he made my big mistake had been presenting the same craft to each customer and telling him this Can be adapted to suit your needs if someone wanted a diving boat I would explain that it could be fitted with compressors and heated and have a diesel engine all that other stuff if an oil company wanted a crew bus I would tell them that suitable seating and a faster engine could be fitted etc etc to the military I said we could bulletproof it on and on and so this is the problem I convinced not a single one of them people do not want all purpose they want high tech specificity so out with the universal modular craft he was pitching a universal modular craft and his sales reflected this the that was not a successful path and then he changes if he's talking to a dive boat he doesn't even talk about all the other stuff he could do he says listen I have just A boat for you my dear sir a purpose built diving boat third lesson from this figure ([Time 0:40:18](https://share.snipd.com/snip/079e3331-ae7a-4afd-9eae-722fb9489e3b))
    - **Note:** Focus on your main value prop for a customer. Don’t have bake anything because it’ll lead to bad demand.
- Challenges of Entrepreneurship: Inexperienced founders and misguided advisors
  Key takeaways:

  - Despite this, they manage to sell 45,000 of their product and maintain a direct relationship with the customer
  - The board decides to bring in a sales manager, but this decision leads to negative consequences
  - Following the sales manager's betrayal, the speaker regrets abandoning direct selling and losing contact with the consumer
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  He's inexperienced. He has partners on this including his brother-in-law You know, they've raised money. So he's got all these like people he's advisors and board a director It's all trying to tell them like what to do and none of them know anything and so they're making they're selling 45,000 ballbarrows a year 45,000 and the product never even existed a few years before and they're going direct and this idea like a direct Relationship with the customer is the holy grail do not abandon it and what happens is the board director said okay Well now we're serious company. We're selling tens of thousands of these things, right? We need to bring in a sales manager and the sales manager is dumber than a bucket full of rocks and A liar and gonna betray him too. The board felt that we should take on a sales manager The sales manager name was John Brandon. He turned out to be a complete bastard I love love how James talks about talks about this in following his advice to abandon direct selling and supply shops via wholesalers We began to lose that contact with the consumer that was the basis of our success as with the dual cyclone So with the ballbarrow see what I mean He's constantly you see him learning these ideas like okay He's smart enough to to ([Time 0:49:10](https://share.snipd.com/snip/bba13d9c-dc63-4adf-be8e-9949491d529b))
    - **Note:** He had the best job ever and left because he had to go out on his own. He went to retailers who wouldn’t buy his ballbarough a wheelbarrow rethought but when he went dtc it was a hit. Then the board brought in a sales manager who messed the whole thing up. He had to restart. Importance of control. This control became a througine for his career.
- Three Years of Toiling for Success
  Key takeaways:
  - The speaker went through three years of struggle to make cyclones alone without anyone's help
  - The speaker could not afford to pay anyone to help him throughout the three years
  - Despite using up all the borrowed money and growing mortgage, the speaker kept persisting and in the end succeeded making it all look like a quantum leap.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  This is all struggle He's gonna go through three years of toiling with nothing to show for day in and day out I made cyclones I would have breakfast with Deidre at half past seven take Jacob and Emily to school and then at 9 a.m I'd go to the coach house, which is the garage I would break for a half hour at lunchtime and see a bit of Sam Sam is his youngest child and then go back to work Until half past six all the while I was making cyclones for three years. I did this alone I could not afford to pay anybody to help me when you start out You just don't think it's gonna take that long Sam grew up and started walking and then talking and all the while I made Cyclones over the next three years We used up all the money that had been borrowed and our mortgage grew steadily bigger and bigger and bigger and again one of my Favorite lines in the book there is no such thing as a quantum leap There is only dogged persistence and in the end you make it look like a quantum leap while it is easy for me to celebrate my doggedness now This is one of the most important paragraphs in the book while it's easy for me to celebrate my doggedness now and say that it is All you need to succeed the truth is that It was that it demoralized me terribly I would crawl into the house every night covered in dust after a long day Exhausted and depressed because that day's cyclone had not worked There were times when I thought it would never work that I would just keep on making cyclone after cyclone never going forwards Never going backwards until I died This was three years of constant work making at least one model a day for over a thousand days I was exhausted and the company had not made any money the money problems were getting more and more serious every day And I had to make this project work or we would go under I was pretty driven and a combination of fear and hope had kept me at my task So after this takes over a thousand days right and so they have this idea they finally get ([Time 1:02:39](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0197e780-98a6-490e-8380-38971fd8ef3c))
    - **Note:** He made thousands of prototypes and it took 15 years to make the vacuum cleaner. Dogged persistence.
- The Success and Struggles of a Futuristic Japanese Vacuum Cleaner
  Key takeaways:
  - The futuristic pink machine half spaceship half vacuum cleaner was a successful product in Japan, making $12 million annually.
  - The product's license deal was bad, resulting in the creator only making the guaranteed minimum of $60,000 a year.
  - Sales reports were handwritten on scraps of paper, making it difficult to verify how many products were sold.
  - The creator hired a local guy in Japan to investigate the licensing deal and discovered that it was not beneficial to him.

  The suspicion in the design world was that this futuristic pink machine half spaceship half vacuum cleaner Just stood in the corner of most Japanese homes and generated ooze and ooze But it stood in a lot of corners And though it took off only gradually within three years it was making sales of $12 million a year Now here's the problem this is it goes back to his whole thing, don't really push control It sells very well but his license deal was bad And so he only the most money he ever makes is the guaranteed minimum of $60,000 a year Because you're relying on the other company to tell you how many they sell He says like they would turn in like sales reports They were like handwritten on like little scraps of paper Then he'd have to have an attorney to try to fight it out But he's in Britain there in Japan Then he hires a local guy in Japan to try to figure out like if they're screwing him on the deal The guy comes back winds up having like you know tea with the people manufacturing James products He says oh no everything's okay and he's just like essentially like he never got to the bottom of it Later on the book goes into more detail but a couple years later He's like okay just buy me out completely and I'll come back and compete with like my own version of this later on And so that's what he does And so in the middle of this as he gets to know Japanese and Japanese culture though he's like oh they're They're they we think the very same way that he believes he believes in progress in stages over a long period of Time And he says Japanese believe in progress by stages in the in the iterative development that I have described as Edisonian The persistent trial and error that allows them to wake up one morning after many many mornings with a world beating product They were learning all the time improving little by little So it says the Japanese took an opposite view of like some other cultures believe in like brilliant Eureka like strikes of genius moments James doesn't believe that at all He says the Japanese took the opposite view they put no faith in individualists and they lived an anti-brilliance culture And that was healthy they knew full well that quantum leaps are very rare But that constant development will result in the end in a better product and that is a mindset I share with them I am not a quantum leaper So now the year Is 1991 remember we got started in 1979 Things are a little better he has a couple license small license agreements But he's really wants to launch in his home market in the British market And then this is going to be like very difficult for a time He also got ripped off by Amway and he's going to like this like patent lawsuit that's very expensive But what's happening here in 1991 with this company called Vax is really important because this is where he's just really This is where he just realizes like forget all this I'm doing everything myself ([Time 1:09:07](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fecbbfb1-0ca3-4dfa-a95c-81880bd856a5))

- "No Idea Starts at a Drawing Board" and Other Creative Tips
  Key takeaways:
  - Ideas rarely come from just sitting and thinking, but rather from observing nature and surroundings
  - Improving existing products can be a successful market strategy
  - Creating new technology can make inventions patentable and protect them from copying

  Something like this Number one, no one ever had an idea staring at a drawing board So do not do this Francis Bacon always got his ideas from walking in the countryside And observing nature rather than sitting in a study So get out and look at things And when an idea comes grab it, write it down And play with it until it works Don't sit and expect ideas to come And always bear in mind though That Bacon died of pneumonia trying to invent frozen chicken He's hilarious Another one, everyday products sell It is harder to improve a mature product If you succeed though, there is no need to create a new market Try out current products in your own home And make a list of things you don't like about them I found about 20 things wrong with my Hoover Junior at the first attempt Then He says he always tries to create new technology The thing about truly new technology is that it makes your invention patentable And then no one can copy it You will find that in the case of almost anything you dream of somewhere Someone may have done something vaguely similar before This is often extremely difficult Another suggestion, use the Edisonian principle Keep testing and retesting and believe only the evidence of your own eyes Not a formula or other people's opinions You may have to fly in the face of public opinion and market research They can only tell you what has happened No research can tell you what is going to happen 5.

    - **Note:** Keep testing and retesting don’t believe market research they can only tell you what happened not what’s going to happen. Put your stamp on the world.
- Tips for Outperforming the Opposition and Designing Expressive Products
  Summary:
  Go for expressive design It is what is inside that is important. Conventional looks do not make a product more marketable 7. Total control From the first sprouting of the idea All the way into the homes of the nation 8. Stamina and conviction Painful but true, this is really selling us that Excellency capacity to take pain 9.

  Constant Revolution Constantly rethink and improve every aspect and function Never being satisfied until you have solved every problem Do that, and you could be sure of consistently and reliably outperforming the opposition Solving functional problems at every level And to a high degree of perfection as possible The only way to keep possession of your invention is to keep strengthening it 6. Go for expressive design It is what is inside that is important To start thinking from the outside is to doom the project from the outset Good design generated out of the function of the thing Will explain why it is better and why it should be bought Products can only be beautiful when they work well And then you can allow the form to follow the function Then be different for its own sake Then make it orange and red or pink and lavender Go further, there is nothing wrong with making the consumer laugh Conventional looks do not make a product more marketable 7. He is speaking about himself here for sure Stamina and conviction Painful but true, this is really selling us that Excellency capacity to take pain Painful but true, breaking the mold will upset people It will take longer than you ever imagined 10 years of development, do you fancy that? And then negotiations on a knife's edge A shoestring and hanging on by a thread It will take balls And finally number 8, total control From the first sprouting of the idea All the way into the homes of the nation It is more likely to succeed if the original visionary Or mule, you put the words mule in parentheses like a visionary Seize it right through, so let me repeat that entire thing From the first sprouting of the idea All the way into the homes of the nation It is most likely to succeed if the original visionary Or mule sees it right through I aim not to be clever but to be dogged And my ([Time 1:20:51](https://share.snipd.com/snip/67f2a0f3-569b-4887-a3ec-e26081641dc8))
    - **Note:** Excellence is the capacity to take pain. Be the dogged mule.
