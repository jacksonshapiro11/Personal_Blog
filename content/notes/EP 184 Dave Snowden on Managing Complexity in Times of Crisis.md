### Highlights

- The GEMBA System: How Comprehensive Journaling Builds Better Decisions
  Key takeaways:
  - Journaling is an important process that can replace reporting and improve data collection in real-time
  - GEMBA system is a way to reduce the time burden on people and give better data to companies
  - Journaling can help activate networks for extraordinary needs and provide insight into near real-time categories
  - Lessons learning is better achieved when closer to the point of learning
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Something that provasively is in this document, and I know it's related to your work with sense maker, is that you advocate from the beginning, starting comprehensive journaling. Yeah. Talk about that. But when I think about as a business guy, I don't think I ever gave the order comprehensive journaling. Right.
  Speaker 1
  What is it? Why is it so important? We call it Gamba because everybody likes Gamba. All right. So it's called Gamba. Yeah. It picks up off that Japanese manufacturing concept. And where we put it in place, first time we ever did it was with the US Army in Afghanistan. So we, and that's when I was teaching just war theory and other things at West Point. And we basically said, if you keep your field notes up to date journaling, you don't have to write a patrol report. That gave us 100% compliance and we got much better data in real time from multiple agents. We combined that with machine data. We could improve ID detection and things like that. Now, we're now doing that in big companies. So we're basically getting rid of reporting. We may be about to do this on clinical trials in favor of journaling. So you give people time back by getting them to do something continuously. Now, that gives you a better mechanism, but it also gives you a network you can ask questions of in real time. Yeah. And interesting just as a sideline, and it's one thing we just put into it is I was at a conference last year. I want the language conference. Well, one of the male keynotes actually slapped a female keynote on the bum as she walked off the stage and said, Well, then last I'll see you in the bar later tonight. And we sort of got him in one side and said, you can't do that. We said, why not? They enjoy it. And at that point, we gave up.
  Speaker 2
  Sure you weren't. He had accidentally gone through a time tunnel back to 1977. Well, it was like 1950s.
  Speaker 1
  All right. It was either way, he talked to women. She said, look, this happens all the time. We just don't report it because you suffer secondary abuse. So one of the things we're now doing, for example, if you've got the GEMBA system, if something happens, which is a microaggression, or a worry about fraud, where you're not going to report it because of what will happen. You report it as a microaggression, in a sense, maker and you index it. It's then immediately encrypted. So nobody can ever see it again. And we look for a pattern in multiple reports, and then we trigger an anticipatory alert to the company. Now, again, that's complexity principles. And then what we want to do is to generate the right training data sets from human interaction. Then we can use AI to trigger alerts. So journaling is actually a way of reducing the time burden on people and giving better data to companies. And it's all in it, GEMBA.
  Speaker 2
  Yeah, we well know from those of us who have done turnarounds and things of that sort, how much time is wasted in zombie reporting. I remember I came in as a turnaround COO one time for a company. It was one of those classic companies. There were, I think, 300. This was in the days of fanfold printed reports. And so I gave the orders to the IT department to stop making half of them and see how many people complain. So we went from 300 to 150. And I think I got one complaint. So we reinstated one of the 150.
  Speaker 1
  We're now deployed in one lay very large public transport infrastructure project to the project at a micro project management level. One of the reasons for that is that big projects always go wrong. So you need to get weak signals early and you don't get that through traditional reporting. So again, all of these things, this is compact. It's the granularity principle we talked about earlier. You want lots and lots of small things from lots of lots of different perspectives continuously coming into the system. Then you can find out what the hell you should do. The more you make it, the less you can do that.
  Speaker 2
  And of course, particularly in a non-stationary situation like a crisis. If you're running a nail factory in 1955, maybe static reporting works. But if you were in, let's say, the music business in 1995, that's a good way to die.
  Speaker 1
  I've got some of these ideas when I was building the decision support system stream. I'm not sure if I'm doing any of my projects along with Guinness. But I think the other thing you're trying to do here is by creating a network which has utility for ordinary purpose.
  Speaker 2
  You can then activate it for extraordinary need. And thinking out loud here, one of the beauties of journaling is you'll see near real-time new categories that didn't exist before. So you also have lessons learning, not lessons learned.
  Speaker 1
  And we know that lessons learned is a disaster because people remember things differently even an hour after they've happened. So the closer you can get to the point of learning, the better. ([Time 0:39:30](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0ae29f6f-f05b-4be0-8061-138d1031eccd))
    - **Note:** Real time journaling helps you keep problems up to date let’s you understand how you are feeling in the moment and allows for faster decisions quicker feedback loops. Get weak signals early so you can learn and adjust on the fly not be reactive.
