### Highlights

- Episode AI notes
  1. Bill Gurley and Brad Gerstner discuss the significant impact of engagement metrics on the user growth potential for applications.
  2. Traditional consumer apps such as Spotify and Instagram achieve engagement rates exceeding 80%, resulting in billions of users.
  3. Generative AI applications like ChatGPT and Claude have engagement levels peaking around 40%, which may restrict their user base to tens of millions.
  4. The lower engagement rates of generative AI applications raise critical questions regarding their scalability and long-term viability compared to established consumer apps. ([Time 0:00:00](https://share.snipd.com/episode-takeaways/f8b78561-4467-4c15-8016-28d06d68427a))
- Engagement Metrics Reveal User Growth Potential
  Summary:
  Engagement metrics significantly influence user growth potential for applications.
  Traditional consumer apps like Spotify and Instagram boast engagement rates exceeding 80%, leading to billions of users. In contrast, generative AI applications like ChatGPT and Claude demonstrate lower engagement levels, peaking around 40%, which could limit their user base to tens of millions rather than billions.
  This analysis raises important questions about the scalability and long-term viability of generative AI apps in comparison to more established consumer applications.

  Speaker 1
  Well, one of the things, you know, a few weeks ago, you cast some doubt on the engagement metrics, you know, at OpenAI. I mentioned I was a little more bullish on OpenAI, but I wanted to do the work. So I had a Poreov on my team, pull some metrics. And so I'm going to run through a few charts here about engagement and usage metrics that we're seeing on GenAI apps compared to other consumer apps and enterprise apps,, get your reaction To this bill. So this first chart here is just weekly average users, monthly average users. And as you see, if you go to the far right on the chart, if you're like Spotify, Instagram, WhatsApp, you know, they have engagement metrics well over 80%. If you look at these generative AI apps, character tops out at about 64%. But if you look at Claude, Gemini, chat GPT, they're about 40%. So much lower engagement than internet consumer apps. Now if you go to the next slide. We go.
  Speaker 2
  And by the way, just so people understand, you're looking at MA, I guess, is this MAU over WA? Oh, it's WAU over MAU, so weekly versus monthly. Okay, gotcha. Correct, correct.
  Speaker 1
  Now, if you go to the next slide, which this is, what does it take to get to a really big app? And if you go to the far right, for those apps that have over 80% engagement, they get to billions of users. But apps with much lower engagement, this all stands to reason, those apps tend to cap out at tens of millions or maybe a hundred million users. Yeah. Right? So the question we were debating is, can chat GPT get to a billion users? ([Time 1:06:58](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5ee463b5-48d8-4b7f-98b9-d7cae02cf04e))
