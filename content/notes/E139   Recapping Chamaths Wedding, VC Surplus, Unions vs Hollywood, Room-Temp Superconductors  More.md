  Speaker 2
  I will say for my own personal experience, I worked as an investment banker for my first few years out of undergrad. I worked, I had a science background, I worked in a short stint in private equity, I worked at Google, I did Corp Dev and M&A there. I started a company, ran it, sold it, did that with another business where I was on the board. So I've been on a couple of different places around the table that I think have given me the ability to provide advice. I don't know if I necessarily have the same skill set that the team at Founders Fund and Mike Moritz and others might have at this astute extraordinary ability to spot founders and bring them in. So I think everyone needs to recognize what they do bring to the table be very clear about what that is. And I think to your point, there has just been an incredible bull market over the last 15 years since 2008, more money has, I heard an incredible statistic by the way. I don't want to get it wrong. So maybe we should fact check me after this from someone at your wedding who I was talking to for a long time. And he was like, he was like basically the top 1% of VCs didn't beat what would have happened if you just bought the top five public tech companies and you know effectively did a rebalance over the past 15 years. The bull market and the aggregation of value in technology has largely been 5050 to public and private. So you could have just bought a few stocks and held on to them and beat all of the VCs over the last 15 years, even though a bunch of VCs have made good money and their IRR looks like 12%.
  Speaker 3
  But you have to beat the risk adjusted returns on venture. Yeah, even and this is not to throw shade at even all of those people that you mentioned are fucking terrible. Like you should not have invested in any of those because there's no way to ton it in any of those funds because you get a small allocation. One fund does well. Three funds do crap over the past 10 years or 15 years.
  Speaker 2
  I forgot the number. We've seen the public market cap of these top tech companies grow from 1 trillion to 10 trillion. That's a 10x. Yeah. So all you had to do was buy those and you would have made 10x and that works out to north of 25% IRR. Yeah. And there's very few VCs that have been able to be 25% IRR. They assume now he was telling me his model shows that over the next 10 years it'll be roughly 70 30. So it'll be about 30% will accrue. And naping over the next 10 years it's going to go from 10 trillion to 25 trillion. Which is still a great return just to build on this.
  Speaker 3
  But it shows how much of a hurdle there is in venture to be successful. I started the business in 2011. So now this is the 12th or 13th year. Just how hard this game is. I had about a 31 32% gross IRR going into last year. And then my IRR fell off a cliff because I couldn't get into obviously there's like there's no money to distribute. Yeah, we're just nothing to distribute. Yeah. So my IRR started decay. And then I had this really, really fucked up choice. I have to start selling stuff earlier than I would have otherwise to get the money back out. So to your point, right now it's a courage. Then it's a really tough game over. It's a really tough game. Yeah. A really tough game.
  Speaker 1
  I think there's also something going on, you know, in the United States and society where there are some idealized jobs, we talked about sacks, elites, surplus elites. And I want to dovetail this with what's happening in Hollywood, the writer strike and the actor strike. And I was looking at it. There's some unbelievable number of actors in SAG, some unbelievable number of writers. They all make just incredibly small amounts of money on average. And obviously there's some big fish who do well, but it does seem like there's too many people who want too many of these idealized jobs. And venture is one of those. And I just would like young people to understand also be careful what you wish for. This job has seemed easy, just like it might seem easy for Tom Cruise or Christopher Nolan. When you see them are Tarantino, what you don't see is all of the people who tried to become Tarantino who tried to become, you know, Tom Cruise. And there are four to 10 to 15 years before they realize that they're not. And they did not actually have the fundamental skills or the work ethic that is required to become Tarantino. I listened to Tarantino's podcast. He does a, have you heard the video archives podcast yet? You have to get on this. It's him and his, the co-writer of, who did you write Pulp Fiction with? Roger Avery. So him and Roger Avery, my favorite podcast right now, they just talk about films. Their knowledge of films is so unbelievable. And the detail in which they talk about that is so crisp. They finish each other's sentences. In the way with maybe you listen to this podcast, you know, we all go, Oh, John Doar. Oh, no, he worked it in town. Oh, this person. And he was a journalist. We have a deep, deep understanding of this business that comes from 30 years within it or 20 years. And I think you have to, I know it sounds corny, but you have to pay your dues. You have to put 60, 70 hours in a week to get that elite job. And the problem today, I feel is, and for people who are listening or young people coming out of schools, if you're not willing to sacrifice 60, 70, 80 hours a week for a decade or two, you're just not going to be successful in that.
  Speaker 3
  By the way, and young people push back on this. And I think the simplest way to reframe it is in the following. Do you really think, for example, let's pick NBA basketball? Do you think you would be really interested or find credible that the best player in the NBA only practiced three hours a week? Does that happen? Or do you think they're practicing three hours in the morning and then also three hours in the afternoon and they give up their lives? The most incredible thing that I saw in the NBA was all of these men literally gave up their life to play that game to perfect it. And that's true for anything. And so I don't understand how, whether if you're a filmmaker, whether you want to be an investor, whether you want to be an athlete, whether you want to be an actor, a surgeon, it's just like, it's an immutable law of physics. So just get over it, which is you need to put in tens of thousands of hours. And if you cannot or won't, you should not expect the success and you should not complain. And also because it's not free.
  Speaker 2
  Yeah, these guys. Do you agree with that or not? Yeah, look, I mean, LeBron 20, what was it? 2016 when they came back in one and game seven, 2016? Yeah, I don't want to. I don't want to add scar tissue. Yeah, right. But the next day, they were, you know, his teammates go out and celebrate, you know, LeBron did on Instagram the next day, posted a photo at seven a.m. Of him. Working out, but look, one thing I'll say, LeBron knows what his skill is and he knows what his game is. I think every individual needs to figure out what their skill is and what their game is and not to find glory in what others have found to be their skill and their game, that there is something that comes from mastering any craft that gives an individual joy and purpose in life. And you see this in basketball, you see it when these athletes really find what they love and they do it and they commit to it. And there are things that we each have realized we are good at and there are things that we've all certainly realized we are not good at. And identifying that mastering one's craft is ([Time 0:28:45](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e2b22a94-c8db-4726-8705-bfee27fd6acf))
