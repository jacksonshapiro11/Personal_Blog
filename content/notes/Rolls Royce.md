### Highlights

- Rolls was a London aristocrat and Royce was a working class school of hard knocks. Henry Royce you can make an amazing product without inventing anything new. They didn’t invent the car they just optimized it. Relentless wins because in the aggregate the unseen details become visible. His grandpa was successful his dad was unreliable poor and unsuccessful while he couldn’t have been more opposite the story of the father is embedded in the son.
  His aunt made gave him a chance to apprentice on the railroad without this he would never have had the educational background to be successful.

    - **Note:** He optimized the car to create innovation when you focus and make the detail so great, the unseen was scene, becomes even better. Path dependence of early life and story of the father. Relentless.
- Observe think about and improve existing machines was the key through line in Royce’s life. Legendary work ethic he works weekends and workers often see him sleeping when they come in in the morning after he worked all night. he starts a business but it’s too volatile. He then uses his machine skills to apply it to build cars and rolls at the same time is looking to get into cars. Right place right time with the right set of skills. Royce was confident in the future of autos and wanted to get into it. Made each detail optimal was a perfectionist he came from nothing and worked very hard and expected the same of all his workers so he was tough to work for.

    - **Note:** Royce was an incrediblly hard worker and rolles provided the funding. Royce had amazing machine skills and would often work all night and on weekends he was demanding but more of himself than anything. This made him tough but good to work for. They both saw a trend and had the right things to bring to the table to ride the wave. Royce like Ferrari was an elite optimizer.
- Coco channel - it is immoral to play at one’s livelihood
  Royce comes up with the principles and spreads it across the organization. Apple is Steve Jobs with 10000 lives.
  His work was known for the excellence and reliability as a whole that competitors couldn’t compete. He focused on bringing one model to perfection.
  Royce almost works himself to death and moves to the south of France to work from there.
  The industry in England couldn’t get off the ground because it was over regulated which killed innovation. This was regulatory capture from the railway industry.
  Rolls Royce competition got rich fat and happy while they took their competitions talent and marched forward. Missionaries not mercenaries.

    - **Note:** Deep dedication to his craft Royce works himself to near death for what he believes in reracked moved to south of France and dedicated to the mission. High quality work.
      Regulatory capture is the norm but eventually they get fat and lazy and give you the hole to run through.
- Royce is told not to build airplane engines but he ignores the board and builds an engine so good even the enemy admires it
  Obsessed with control when the government says they need to have other companies build their engines they say they’d rather go to prison than outsource and risk quality drop they then said they’d rather run a smaller company than be a cog in a larger company.
  Claude Johnson was the business side of the company and they complemented each other very well.
  The entire design team was based in France with the manufacturing in England. They didn’t have a telephone in the office the strove for intense focus. This design team was the apex of the company.
  Royce worked until he died with him handing a sketch to his nurse the night before he died.
  Wanted his designers to be focused all the time he stripped everything down and tested it to extremes believing such exercises saved time in the long run. His tradition of functional perfection was the driving mission of rolls Royce.
  Whatever is rightly done however humble is noble

    - **Note:** Royce didn't believe in stupid rules just because they came from authority. He needed to do his own thing he would never sacrifice quality. He would rather go to prison missionary vs mercenary. He has the independent thinking and has done the work to be confident in his decisions so he doesnt need to go by the book
      There was a strong synergy between the business and design team that allowed for the design team to completely focus on what they did. This intense focus for hours is the mark of true success. They did this by creating the right environment
      He worked until he died he loved it so much
      He stripped everything down and simplified it which took longer but created the right trade off long and short term incentive allignement.
      Independent thinker. Deep focus. Quality over everything. Doing what he loves understood what he wanted. Simplicity and deep first principles thinking. Missionary.
