- A Story Transforms; Reporting Does Not
  Summary:
  A good story differs from a bad story in its ability to convey change and transformation over time.
  Rather than merely recounting events chronologically, an effective story showcases a realization or personal growth. This transformative quality engages the audience, as they are more interested in narratives that offer entertainment or insight rather than mere reports of daily life.
  To craft a memorable story, one must understand that listeners seek reasons to engage with the narrative and must approach storytelling with the intention of holding their attention.
  The distinction between a well-told story and a lackluster one lies in the storyteller's commitment to entertain and provide value, encouraging a genuine connection with the audience.

  Speaker 1
  What's the difference between a good story and a bad story? I think we can start by thinking about what is a story and what isn't a story because most people don't tell stories. Most people think of a story as some stuff happened over the course of time and now I'm going to tell you about that, usually chronologically and that will amount to a story. And that really is just reporting on your life and no one actually wants you to report on your life. You know, other than maybe your mother and your spouse might be required to listen. It's just a simple accounting of your day or your week or your month and that's not interesting and it's not a story. So a story is about change over time. Usually it's sort of a realization. Like I used to think one thing and now I think another thing. That's most stories. Sometimes they're transformational, meaning I once was one kind of person, then some stuff happened and now I'm actually an authentically different kind of person. But if you're just doing that, you're better than most people. That sort of is the difference between a bad story and a good story, is what is a story and what is not a story. Once we get to the difference between sort of a well-told story or well-crafted story, and one that is not as well crafted, we get into things like the acknowledgement that no one wants To hear anything you ever have to say unless you give them a reason to listen. And there are people who tell stories that don't have that fundamental belief as part of their bone marrow. And the more you believe that, the more you believe that I must entertain while speaking, delivering content, showing data, delivering a keynote, the more you believe that no one wants To hear anything I have to say, unless I'm relentlessly giving them a reason to listen. That's really the difference between someone who is going to be appreciated and remembered and impactful and someone who will sort of get lost in the crowd.
  Speaker 2
  Of the difference boils down to thinking about the story you're going to tell beforehand? And then there's like this game where you're pretending to sort of like ad lib it on the spot and the listener is like pretending that you're ad libbing it on the spot because they want That too. ([Time 0:04:20](https://share.snipd.com/snip/50d412b7-f525-409f-b12b-bafd9361500f))
    - **Note:** A story is different from recounting events by being a thoughtfully crafted narrative. A good story pulls people in doesn’t just exist. So it must be both crafted and entertaining. A good story isn’t memorized but understood at a systems level and implemented at a point level clear vision flexible execution.
- An Anecdote Delights, a Story Resonates
  Summary:
  Anecdotes serve as brief, entertaining moments that provoke laughter but fade quickly from memory, akin to cotton candy.
  In contrast, stories create lasting impressions, engaging emotions and provoking deep reflection. While anecdotes share a surface-level experience, stories forge connections that resonate long after they are told, evoking personal feelings and shared human experiences.
  The intent behind a story is to cultivate a meaningful emotional connection rather than simply recount an event.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So an anecdote doesn't have to have change over time. It's essentially one of those, hey, this funny thing happened to me, isn't this crazy? But it tends not to linger. You know, a story ideally is the kind of thing that when I tell it to you, you're thinking about it for days, weeks, months, or maybe for the rest of your life. Whereas an anecdote is you sit down and you have beers with your buddies and something crazy happened on the golf course, you know, something happened in the airport and you tell them It and they all laugh. But it's not the kind of thing they want to go and repeat to someone. They're not going to remember it. I often think of anecdotes as cotton candy. It's like delicious in the moment and lovely but you don't really remember your cotton candies but you remember the best meals of your life. Stories are the best meals of your life. The ones you reflect back and go I remember the restaurant, I remember who I was with, I remember what I ordered. That's the story.
  Speaker 2
  Because you're connecting to an emotion?
  Speaker 1
  Ideally touching their hearts and their minds. If I tell you an anecdote about my son, we're gonna laugh, we're gonna understand his humanity even a little bit, you might even reflect on my humanity, but you're not going to be sort Of thinking about it later on because I'm not looking to land something in your heart and mind. I'm not looking to connect to your life experiences. When I tell a story, I'm not hoping that you are thinking that once happened to me. What I'm hoping is you're thinking I once felt that way.
  Speaker 2
  I once thought that way or maybe someday I could feel or think that way. That's the goal. That's sort of that under story that we're always looking to tell. So before we get into more of a crafting a story, maybe it would help to have an example of a story. ([Time 0:08:10](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d75eb95d-4535-447c-bcc7-f24371ffbbad))
    - **Note:** Anecdotes make people laugh stories touch people’s souls.
- The Spoon of Power: A Lesson in Perspective
  Summary:
  The story illustrates the transformative power of perspective, showing how something as mundane as a kitchen spoon can become a symbol of empowerment and support.
  The narrative highlights the importance of storytelling in conveying emotions and values, where the spoon transcends its ordinary function to become an instrument of encouragement for students facing challenges. It emphasizes the significance of community and mutual support, particularly during tough times like the pandemic.
  The object, initially desired for its physical presence, evolves into a tool that brings comfort and reassurance, fostering resilience among children.
  Ultimately, the spoon serves as a reminder that simple items can hold profound meaning when infused with intention and narrative.

  Speaker 1
  So tell you a story. Yeah Well the one I like to tell I mean for business people I'm standing Behind my school where I teach I'm a fifth grade teacher. I'm standing in front of this enormous pile of fall leaves and they're quivering There's a little boy inside the leaves and his hand emerges and he's got a metal object in his hand and He looks at me His head pops out. His name is Jamie. He says look what I found and he's this metal object. And I say, wow, look at it. And he says, yeah, it's a spoon. And it is, it's just a kitchen spoon. It fell out of a lunchbox yesterday or 10 years ago. It's migrated to the bottom of this pile. And now Jamie, this little red headed boy has it in his hand. But I tell Jamie, I say, that's not just a spoon, Jamie, that's the spoon of power. And moment that I declare it to be the spoon of power, Jamie knows I must have it. And I know Jamie knows this because he just starts running. He doesn't say a word, he just sprints because he knows his crazy teacher will now chase him down for the spoon and he's not wrong. I'm responsible for like a hundred kids. I have to keep them safe, keep them secure. I don't care about any of them anymore. It's a red-headed boy and a spoon that I must now have. And for 18 minutes over the course of this recess, I hunt this boy down. I chase him across a field, up a slide, you know, down the other slide, through the woods. 18 minutes later, he still has the spoon in his hand. I can't believe it. I legitimately tried to catch a 10-year and I could not. But he's in my class, so it's fine. I'll get him eventually. He's a 10-year boy. He's focused now on the spoon, but he has the attention spin of like a mulberry bush. He's gonna forget it in a minute and I'm gonna grab it. So I'm teaching math. I'm writing equations on the board. This kid, he's put the spoon on the corner of his desk, like to dare me to get it. You know, it's just out of my reach. So I've got one eye on the board, one eye on him and the spoon. He's got one eye on his journal, one eye on the spoon. We're in this like standoff. And then I'm reading, sitting on a stool, I'm reading a book. He's still got the spoon right there. I've got one eye on the book, one eye on the spoon. He's got one on me, one eye on the spoon. If you'd ever been this focused in his life, he'd like cure cancer. I've never seen him so focused. But he's like me, he's a writer. He loves to write. So at the end of the day when we write, his head always falls onto his arm. You know, the strokes of his pen get long. He's gonna get lost in his story and that's the moment I'll strike. I watch it happen. I just wait. See the little red head go down, lands on his arm. I sneak up the front aisle. I reach over to grab the spoon and it's not there. And he turns to me and he says, did you really think I was just gonna leave it there for you? And I lose my mind. Like I start threatening the class. I turn to the right like, where's the spoon? The girl says, leave us alone. We're trying to get our work done. Turn to the, where's the spoon? And the boy says, why are you bothering me? I'm trying to be a good student. They all know where it is. They're all conspiring against me. Then the bell rings. Jamie's out of his seat. He runs to get his coat and he swings by and he pulls the box of books out in the library marked S. He reaches inside and he says, I filed it under S for spoon and he's out the door. I can't believe it. I legitimately tried to get a spoon from a 10 year old kid and I could not do it. So the next day he comes in, he has the spoon on a chain around his neck and he's swinging it around and I say, how did you? And he said, my dad drilled the hole. My mom gave me the chain and he's walking around going, oh, it's a spoon of power, Mr. Dix, the spoon of power. And as bad as I am, I like I'm a terrible person sometimes. Even I can't hear it from the neck of a 10-year So all week he tortures me with this. And then Thursday comes. It's time for our weekly math test. It's time for Mackenzie to lose her mind because someday Mackenzie might get a problem wrong and that will be the end of the world for Mackenzie. So every Thursday I have to like build her up. Mistakes are valuable. It's okay, Mackenzie. You might get one wrong. And she's sort of falling apart as she does. And then Jamie's there and he takes the spoon off and he says maybe this will help. And he puts it around Mackenzie's neck and it's the best math test Mackenzie has ever taken in her life. Somehow this spoon on her neck calms her down. Three days later, David's grandfather passes away. When David comes back to school, Jamie's by the door waiting for David. When he walks in, puts the spoon on David's neck and says, I think you need this today. And he did. For the rest of the year, every single time a kid is in trouble in any way whatsoever, that spoon finds their way on his neck, on their neck. They forget their homework. They have to walk over to me, face the music we call it. They walk over with that damn spoon on their neck. They get in trouble with the principal They gotta make a long walk down the linoleum hallway. They make the long walk with the spoon They get bullied on the bus on the way to school when they go home that day to go home with the spoon every single time It makes the kids days better. So the last day of school I gather all my kids on the floor in front of me It's the last time we're gonna be together as a family and they really are a family. They, we get to know each other in really meaningful ways. And so I tell them, say whatever you want, tell us what you're feeling, you know, we're gonna have to say goodbye now. So Jamie stands up and he walks over to me. He takes the spoon off and he tries to give it to me. And I say to Jamie, no. I say there was a day back in October when I wanted that spoon badly and had I caught you, I would have fried it from your little fingers. But you managed to keep it and do this amazing thing with it. I just can't believe what you've done. It's your spoon. And Jamie says no. Jamie says the magic of the spoon only works in my classroom. He tells me I need to take it so that next year when kids are in trouble, I can give them the spoon like he has this year. And then he pulls this little orange chair up alongside me so he can get up to eye level and he takes the spoon off and for the first time I get to wear the spoon of power. The 2020-2021 school year was the hardest I've ever taught in my 26 years of teaching, the pandemic. We went right back to school in September and masks and social distancing, and everyone was afraid and lots and lots of people got sick. Kids got sick, parents got sick, we lost grandparents. My wife, who's a kindergarten teacher, got very sick. My own children got sick. And I used that spoon more often that year than I've ever used it in my life. Every day, people were wearing that spoon. And for the first time in my life, my colleagues were wearing a spoon of power to get through the day. And as hard as it was, there's the best year of teaching I've ever had, the most important year I will ever teach. But I've always felt like I was the luckiest teacher in America because I have that spoon. I've had it for 16 years. It's literally in that bag right there. I carry with it. I c...

    - **Note:** A great story. Stakes surprise suspense and humor are key to stories. a good story plays with your emotions if you’re about to feel sad it starts to make you feel very happy so you can feel the contrast. a good story is an emotional roller coaster that balances and emphasizes all emotions. Let the imagination run, describe less because that allows the listener to see more when you say you’re in a classroom it’s better you don’t get the description and instead just use what you think the classroom
      Should be in your mind.
- Engage Through Action, Not Background
  Summary:
  Successful storytelling hinges on engaging the audience right from the start.
  Audiences crave the core elements of what was said, felt, and done rather than background details. Storytellers often falter by opening with excessive exposition instead of diving directly into the action or the pivotal moment.
  Captivating beginnings are crucial for capturing attention; thus, stories should initiate at the moment of intrigue and revelation rather than starting with context or unnecessary details.
  This approach allows the storyteller to fill in important information organically as the narrative unfolds, keeping the audience engaged and eager to learn more.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  That's the one who's going to succeed. You can share the, like, what your mother looks like with your spouse, with, you know, your closest friend who's willing to put up with you. But the audience doesn't want to see your mother. They want to know what was said, what was felt, and what was done. Everything else let us fill in with our brains. So that's a mistake they make. The other problem people have is I just believe the beginnings of stories are essential to grabbing people's attention and people waste the beginnings of stories explaining and teaching Us things rather than launching stories in the proper place. In the hands of a lesser storyteller, let's say, the spoon of power story begins with, I'm a fifth grade teacher. I'm working at a school in Connecticut. It's called Walcott School. I teach about 23 kids per year. We have recess in the middle of the school day. And so I'm teaching social studies one day when the bell rings and I tell all my kids it's time to go out to recess. One of my students is named Jamie, Jamie Calvert. He's this little red-headed boy. He's very precocious. That's how most people start the story, which is I need to teach you a whole bunch of stuff so that the story will make sense. That's the worst way to begin a story because no one has ever sat down and said, boy, I hope he teaches me a lot of stuff before he says something good. So that story starts in the right place, which is the actual moment the spoon makes an appearance. I'm going to teach you all the rest of the stuff along the way, but I'm not going to open my story by boring you. I'm going to open it with location, action, a little bit of wonder, right? ([Time 0:39:13](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b18920da-53fa-46c4-9655-69cfa7e4f02e))
    - **Note:** Good stories allow you to craft more than is described. You paint a picture in your brain it’s not overly descriptive allows the reader to take agency. The beginning of a story is vital to grab people and the end is vital to close it up. Start with the end what is the transformation in this story what at the end is the point you want to make what will have changed.
- Aim for Change in Storytelling
  Summary:
  Effective storytelling requires a clear purpose and direction from the outset.
  Without a definitive end point, narratives can devolve into mere anecdotes, lacking real substance or impact. A story must reflect a transformation or realization, demonstrating how a person's perceptions have evolved over time.
  Both the ending and beginning of a story should present contrasting viewpoints, where the conclusion reveals a lesson learned or a change experienced.
  To engage audiences, it’s essential to present a story that prompts them to reflect on their own worldviews.
  The emotional weight of a story lies not in the events but in the contrasts and the insights they generate, allowing for genuine storytelling that resonates with listeners and leaves them feeling their time was well spent.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And I say, well, if you say a bunch of things, you're not saying anything. You have to have something that you're aiming at at the end. Even with a marketing deck. I always say, what are the last three slides? And they say, well, we don't know. We haven't gotten to those. And I said, that's where we start though. We want to land somewhere. Otherwise we're just collecting slides and changing the order three days before the event and then two days before the event and then two hours before the event. We're going to say something or we're not going say something. So in storytelling, regardless of what the story is, it's always what am I trying to say at the end? Meaning how did I change transformation or realization? How did my perception of the world, my perception of myself, my perception of a spoon, right? Or how I live as a human being, how has that changed over time? And if it's not a genuine change, it's just a thing that happened. It might be an amusing anecdote. I had a amusing moment in the airport yesterday. I got diverted by the customs agent. I sort of did a bad job with the first customs agent and he put a red X on my form and I thought, I've never seen that before. And so he said, move on. And I went to that place where they sort of release you and I went right with everybody else. And the guy said, nope, you go left. And I went into customs agent layer two, which I'd never been in before. And there was a harder questioning. They were essentially trying to figure out why I was here. Are you doing business here? And I'm like, no, I'm not getting paid. I'm just going to talk to a guy. I said it in a way that made them very suspicious of me. And in the end, the way they stopped being suspicious of me is they found my Wikipedia page and they said, oh, look, you're an American novelist and storyteller. And suddenly they all relaxed and everyone was like, okay, we understand why you're here. That was an amusing anecdote. It's not a story because when I left customs, I was not thinking, oh, I see the world in a different way. I see myself in a different way. I see customs in a different way. None of those things happened. It was the kind of thing I'll tell my wife and she'll go, huh, that's funny. And three months from now, neither one of us will remember it because it's cotton candy. That's what so many people do though. They think, oh, I have a story. Let me tell you about customs. I would never say I have a story. I said, something strange happened to me in customs the other day, right? But it's not a story. I might probe it and say, is there a story there? Is there something about me having a Wikipedia page? That's kind of weird, right? But I don't think there is, because I didn't feel, you know, that feeling you get. It's a feeling of something just happened, you know, and sometimes you don't know what it is. I have taken 25 years to figure out some of the things that have happened to me in my life. But I knew 25 years ago that it was something. And I knew it was something because I kept coming back to it in my life. You're like, that moment really sticks with me. You know, sometimes it sticks with you because it was crazy. Sometimes it sticks with you because like in the heart, in the mind, it really hung with you. So you have to have something to say. You have to have a point and we start at the end because we want to land in a place where people go, oh, my time was well spent. He's presented me with a new way to look at the world. He's made me reflect upon my position on this planet, that kind of a thing. That's what we're looking for. And that can be as simple as I want you to see my product in a new and interesting way. So when you leave, you go, wow, that really is kind of an interesting broom. I've got a broom in my house but I actually think they've upgraded the broom. Like I'm feeling I gotta go get that broom now because I don't have the right broom. That's actually a feeling and that would be the end of a story too. We gotta ask ourselves what actually generates change over time? That's the end of the story. And then how does the end inform the beginning? Well, they're almost always in perfect contrast to each other. They have to be opposite of some way. If you want change over time, for the end of my story, I've learned a thing. At the beginning of the story, I must not have that thing learned. If at the end of the story, I say this is a spoon of power and it's really going to become the most powerful teaching tool I'll ever have. The beginning of the story is it's just a spoon. And those are words I actually use in that story, just an ordinary kitchen spoon. I tell you in the beginning, this is a meaningless kitchen spoon that because Lord of the Rings was on the, you know, popular, I declared it the spoon of power for reasons that make no sense Except that's who I am, right? But essentially was a nothing and I made it a something. So we ask ourselves at the end, what's the change, what's the meaning, and then the beginning is always going to be the opposite of that. And now we have change over time. Now we create what I call an arc, right? It's going to go from one place to another. The customs agent story you can feel, it's flat. Like there's no opening where Matt is nervous about going through customs. I've done it a million times. Even when I saw the red X, I'm in Canada. What are they going to do? You know, I guess if I was in another country, if I had just entered North Korea and I got a red X, maybe I have a story now, right? But in Canada, I was thinking the worst they're going to do is like make me wait a little bit longer before I enter Canada, right? So this is not a story because I didn't feel that thing and therefore I can't have the opposite of that thing.
  Speaker 2
  It's hilarious to me that story because, I mean, everybody can get into Canada and yet we stop you. Right.
  Speaker 1
  Well, again, it was probably because I was communicating poorly, like, what's the purpose of your visit? I'm here to see a guy. What does that mean? I'm gonna talk to him. What are you gonna talk to him about? Well, it's on a podcast. What do you mean on a podcast? You know, I was like, I'm just not doing a good job here And that's like I got myself into trouble because I didn't tell a good story So if the ending is the opposite and the beginning is the
  Speaker 2
  Opposite so like you have these two transformations walk me through some common Movies and how you see them and this might ([Time 0:42:21](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e4b4921d-81ef-4c4d-8d4b-bc3a68c89a32))
    - **Note:** Stories vs anecdotes. Stories create real change in your mind they make a real point that changes how you see the world. Anecdotes don’t do that they’re just fun to hear. Start with the end your point then work backwards. Create an arc which is change over time. Feel that thing and feel the opposite of that that.
- Opening Scenes Foretell Endings
  Summary:
  The opening scenes of movies often foreshadow their conclusions, establishing a predictive narrative that shapes audience expectations.
  In romantic comedies like 'When Harry Met Sally,' the characters' initial aversion foreshadows their ultimate union, providing the audience with both clarity and enjoyment. Similarly, 'Star Wars: A New Hope' introduces a protagonist whose journey transcends mere adventure, ultimately highlighting themes of faith and personal growth.
  The film suggests that reliance on belief, rather than technology, is the key to overcoming challenges.
  Furthermore, 'Independence Day' illustrates how characters initially seeking respect overcome their struggles to gain validation from those they value.
  These narratives resonate deeply with viewers, as they reflect universal aspirations for recognition and success, making even average films memorable by tapping into these powerful themes.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Opposite so like you have these two transformations walk me through some common Movies and how you see them and this might wreck movies for everybody listening going forward But talk To me about how the opening scene of a movie often predicts the end and maybe use some examples.
  Speaker 1
  All of the openings of movies, almost all of them will predict the end of the movie for sure. Romantic comedies are the easiest to play with in the beginning. If you see a movie like When Harry Met Sally, they actually say they hate each other at the beginning. I hate you, Harry. They do not get along. They travel across country and they can't stand each other the whole road trip. We know at the end they're gonna end up together, right? There's no way you can't know that. Doesn't mean you're not gonna enjoy the film. It just tells you this is how this movie is going to end, right? If we think about the first Star Wars, you know, A New Hope, we meet a boy on a planet who's dreaming with his friends about flying in space someday and using blasters and spaceships to Defeat an empire. That's the beginning of it, right? So we have to know that that's not what's going to happen over the course of this movie. What happens is he meets Jesus in the form of Obi-Wan Kenobi because it's really a religion story. It's about a boy who thinks he's gonna fly in a spaceship and defeat the Empire and instead he finds religion, something called the Force, and at the end of the movie when he's ready to Use that spaceship to defeat the Empire, he turns off his targeting computer and he says, I don't need technology, I have religion and religion will save the day. That's why when you leave that movie you feel good. There's lots of space movies and some of them you leave and you go, ooh, that was a something. And then there are other movies you leave and go, that was great and you forget all about it. Because there's something about watching a character find a religion and then use that belief in the thing to defeat evil that means something to us. My favorite example is like not a great movie but Independence Day, the Alien Invasion movie. I love that movie because that is so perfectly constructed. That is a movie about people. There's multiple protagonists in that movie. People who are all failing to get the respect of the people they value most. So like Will Smith's character at the beginning of the movie is rejected by NASA. You don't get to be an astronaut. If you don't think Will Smith isn't going to space at some point in that movie, you're crazy. The president is being accused of being weak. He's soft on crime. He's a weakling. You know, he's not the strong man he once was. If you don't think at the end of that movie he's gonna somehow be fighting an alien actually in his plane, right? You're crazy. It tells you exactly what's gonna happen. Jeff Goldblum's character at the beginning of the movie, you're doing something with like satellites and television, right? His father doesn't, thinks he's wasting his time. His wife, who's sort of estranged from him, is doing big work and he's doing nothing. He's like just sending cable television up to space. That's what you're doing. All of those characters are essentially characters who are being disrespected by the people they value the most. And at the end of the movie, all of them will gain the respect of the people they value the most. Now, if Roland Emmerich who made that film said, hey, Shane, wanna come to my movie? It's about a bunch of people who are not really feeling the respect they deserve. And over the course of time, they're going to find that respect and it's actually going to come from the sources that they value the most. You're probably not very excited about it. But if you place those actual stories, a minced and alien invasion, suddenly we have something that people want to go to. And when they leave, they go, it's kind of not a great movie. And yet for some reason, it sort of stays with us in a way that other movies don't. And I really believe that's why. Even if we don't know it on the surface level, I believe that somewhere inside we recognize we watched people do a thing that we hope to do someday, which is to say, get the people who don't Notice us to notice us. That's what that movie is about. Oh, that's interesting. I mean, when I hear that and I'm like, why is it memorable? ([Time 0:47:34](https://share.snipd.com/snip/47d28681-b6a2-4557-8bad-d6a90495123d))
    - **Note:** You can tell the end of the movie by the beginning. Good storytelling in movies gaining the respect of others.
- Strategic Listening Breeds Empowered Storytelling
  Summary:
  To become a better storyteller, one must practice strategic listening instead of passive consumption.
  This involves actively analyzing stories and films to understand what elements contribute to their impact, such as humor or emotional resonance. Many people consume content without reflecting on the mechanics that make it effective or flawed.
  A strategic listener dissects narratives to uncover underlying themes, providing insights into social dynamics represented in media.
  For example, movies like Wonder Woman and Mary Poppins illustrate patterns where female characters often rely on male sacrifices to succeed, which can negatively influence young audiences' perceptions of gender roles.
  Conversely, stories with ambiguous endings, like Thelma and Louise and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, engage viewers in critical thinking and leave lasting impressions. Such open-ended conclusions encourage interpretation and reflection, enhancing the storytelling experience and empowering the audience to consider broader possibilities.

  Speaker 2
  I love that. That's really cool. How do we learn to tell better stories then like Walk me through, you teach a class on this, what's that process for if you had to give a high level overview of that? How do you learn to do that?
  Speaker 1
  Start by becoming what I call strategic listeners. There's listening, which everyone thinks they're good at and many people are not. Then there's active listening, which is, as far as I can tell you, look at the person in NOG while they speak, but I'm not sure if that actually yields anything. What I say is strategic listening, which is what I'm relentlessly doing all the time, which is to say if I'm watching a movie and it makes me laugh, I say to myself, what did they just do To make me laugh? Like what combination of words or situations did they assemble or how were the words spoken in a way that produced the laugh? If you hear someone tell a great story and you think, wow, that was a great story or a great movie, strategically you should be thinking, what was it about that story, about that movie, About the book I just read that made it great? I think a lot of times what happens is people allow that content to wash through them, which is great if you want to be a consumer of other people's greatness. But if you want to be a reproducer of that greatness, then we have to be strategic. My wife, when we leave movies, I don't know, somehow she knows when I know a movie is terrible, even if she thinks it's good. Like, we left the first Wonder Woman movie and she was feeling great because it was feminist superhero icon. And as we left the movie theater, she goes, I know something's wrong with that movie. I can tell by the way you're walking. And I said, that movie is a disaster. And she said, can you not tell me for 15 minutes so I can keep enjoying it? What she was saying is there's something fundamentally flawed with that movie and you as a strategic listener have pinpointed it. I have pinpointed it right now. I'm just a consumer of this content. Eventually you're going to tell me and it's gonna ruin the movie for me But just let me enjoy it for a little bit. I told her I said I never have to tell you and she said no You'll eventually tell me so, you know 15 minutes down the road. I told her what was wrong with Wonder Woman as soon as I told her She said ah, what a terrible movie and I said, yeah I know but most people won't notice because they're going to be consumers Of the content and not the strategic pulling apart at the threads kind of person. I'm the pulling apart at the threads kind of person. If you can become that, then you're going to be a much more effective storyteller because you're going to pick up on the things that people are doing.
  Speaker 2
  If I don't ask, I'm going to get eviscerator for this. So what was wrong with Wonder Woman?
  Speaker 1
  So at the end of Wonder Woman, did you see the movie? I did like a long time ago. I forget it. The end of the movie, Gal Gadot, Wonder Woman, she's battling the bad guy. He's some sort of god or something. Hades. Hades. And they're fighting. And while that's going on, Wonder Woman's boyfriend, for lack of a better word, is in a plane and he's flying some poisonous bomb into the sky. She's losing to Hades. She's about to be killed by Hades. And then off in the sky, she sees her boyfriend and he dies. The plane blows up. He's risked his life to save her and all the people in the area, right? And it's at that moment that she finds the strength to rise up and defeat Hades, which means there's a story about a woman who is incapable of winning her own battles unless a man sacrifices His life and therefore inspires her to defeat the bad guy. Oh, that's interesting. I'd never thought of it that way. But that's exactly what happens, right? But how often in movies does that happen? When Luke Skywalker defeats the Empire, it's not because he's thinking about Princess Leia. He doesn't need Princess Leia to inspire him to take the shot, right? In movies, quite often, many times, almost always, the man manages to defeat the bad guy without any inspiration, right? When Iron Man defeats Thanos, he's literally looking at Doctor Strange. He's not looking at his wife who is on the battlefield with him. He's looking at Doctor Strange. And Doctor Strange says like, this is the one in a million circumstances where we might win, right? He's not relying on a woman and the support of his wife to do it. He's doing it on his own with a little information from a guy. And that's how most male heroes win the day. Female heroes in so many movies can only win the day if a man does something first. Actually, the Mary Poppins movie, the new update of Mary Poppins, is even more egregious. Because Mary Poppins is this woman who's trying to save this family. There's a father who could be the hero of the day and he's not. And there's two kids. They could be the hero of the day. They could save the home, but they don't. Mary Poppins could be the hero of the day. She doesn't. Instead, quite literally, the door opens and a man walks in, the guy who played Bert in the original movie. He's the he's an old actor that we're all happy, suddenly made a last appearance. The door opens and he basically says, I have all the money you need. Here you go. Everyone fails to save the day and then the door opens and a white guy with a bunch of money walks in and says, here you go. Here's what you need. And we're all happy because we see an old actor that we didn't know was gonna be in the movie and he suddenly appears and we're happy and hooray, the day's been saved. And I sit there and go, really? None of the people in the movie are gonna save the day. We're gonna have the random white guy we haven't seen for all except the last two minutes of the movie pop in. But that's the difference between being a strategic listener and saying what's happening in the story and someone who just is enjoying it. And there's nothing wrong with enjoying it. Although I do think in both of those movies, I think that what is being said, which is women can't win the day, I think that does sort of work its way into our unconscious. I actually think both those films are pretty bad if you're a little girl and you're watching that movie because you don't get to see kids win in Mary Poppins. You don't get to see Mary Poppins win. You don't get to watch Wonder Woman win on her own merit. I do think that they're sort of insidious in that way. Not intentionally. I don't, I can't even comprehend why these filmmakers did not see these problems as they were putting their films together, or they decided they were problems, but who cares? Because we have to kill them somehow, and why would we kill them for no reason? So we'll do it for that reason. But I do think they're pretty detrimental to girls in general.
  Speaker 2
  JS So if you're a parent, you have a young daughter, what's a good movie to watch with her that is not like that, that'll cede the unconscious properly about the woman sort of not needing Anybody else and ... ([Time 0:55:56](https://share.snipd.com/snip/09113f27-4119-4197-9e50-c76c06e1c6ad))
    - **Note:** Strategic listening understanding and breaking down what is being said. Understand the meta story not just the words being said. Strategic listener vs what is enjoying it. Be very intentional about the meta story. Incomplete stories allow us to sit with feelings better and invent our own endings.
- Vulnerability Enhances Connection in Storytelling
  Summary:
  Embracing vulnerability in storytelling fosters audience engagement.
  Rather than eliminating mistakes or foolish actions, highlighting them can create relatable and compelling narratives. Effective stories are not merely sequences of unrelated events ('and stories') but rather interconnected moments that build tension and connection ('but...
  therefore' stories). Each scene should meaningfully contribute to the overall narrative, making it impossible to remove elements without losing coherence.
  Stories should evoke emotions and maintain momentum, drawing the audience into the journey through the strategic use of conjunctions. The word 'but' stands out as a powerful tool, introducing conflict and complexity to capture listeners' interest.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  If I did something stupid over the course of the story, I'm not going to remove the stupid thing I did in an effort to make myself look better. In fact, I will enhance the stupid thing I did because I know that audiences really want, you know, that vulnerability is what they crave. So whenever I do something stupid, I am thrilled because it often means I'm going to have a story to tell.
  Speaker 2
  A lot of people tell and stories. This happened and then this and then this and then this. Right. And it's not super engaging. And I remember listening to a clip, the South Park guys, they used the terms but and therefore and then I remember reading this in your books to talk to me about this and like how we take
  Speaker 1
  An end story and make it a but therefore story. It was devastating from when I saw that clip too, because I thought I had stumbled upon something that was mine like, hey, look what I found. And then someone said, that's great. Did you know the South Park guys believe that too? And I was like, oh, really? I was going to be like Matthew Dicks only. But they're right. And I'm right too. And Anne's story is essentially a story that is a series of events, one after the other, that are not connected in any meaningful way. First graders tell those stories all the time. I got up and then I got my cereal and then I went to school, right? But adults still tell those stories too. Actually, most decks that I'm working on with marketing and salespeople are and stories. You know it's an and story because if you can just throw a slide into a deck, you don't have a story. Because I couldn't just throw a scene into the spoon of power and still have that story work, right? But people feel they can do that. I'm like, well, that's fine, but you're not telling a story. Now you're just, you're just a slide monkey. You're just throwing in slides. So an Anne story is the kind of story that if we take something out, the story still plays. Nothing really changes in the story. We still can get to the end, which means it's probably not a story. You're probably just reporting on your day. But our therefore stories rely on connection. Scenes are connected to other scenes, connected to other scenes. So I'm doing this, but that happened. Therefore this happened, but then that happened. And when we connect it in that way, we can't actually remove anything from the story because the story will fall apart. I also think it creates motion in a story, sort of an angular, exciting nature to the story. The spoon of power appears, but it's not the spoon of power. It's not just a spoon, it's the spoon of power. Therefore, I must have it. So, which is because, which is therefore, so I chase Jamie, but I don't get it. But that's okay because he's my student and I'm still gonna have time to teach him. So I'm in math, right? But he's put the spoon right here. So we're in this standoff. Then we're, I'm doing reading, but the spoon is still here. But that's okay because eventually I'm gonna teach writing. I walk up the but the spoon isn't here. The bell rings, therefore Jamie gets out of the seat, runs over to his coat, but also goes to the library and pulls out the spoon. So if you're butting and thereforeing all the way through, you know that every scene is required. You know you don't have any fluff along the way, there's no extra scene sort of hanging out. And people are gonna be so invested in the story. I always tell people the but is the most powerful word in all of storytelling. ([Time 1:06:02](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b1e4f2ad-123e-4bea-8f13-29eb6f7ec6c5))
    - **Note:** The power of but and therefore stories not and stories. Vulnerability with people opens the room and people’s hearts which creates genuine connection.
- Energize Your Expression by Embracing the Negative
  Summary:
  Embrace the practice of articulating what something is not to enhance dynamic speech and engage listeners.
  This method helps individuals break away from flat expressions, encouraging a more vivid and energetic narrative. Stories don't need to be grand; even mundane moments can be powerful if imbued with meaning.
  Emphasize the importance of recognizing that life is filled with stories, both big and small, and that the relatability of these stories can significantly impact audience engagement.
  Establish suspense through strategic information exclusion and inclusion to maintain listener interest, making them eager to hear more.
  People should ask themselves if their audience would care if the story was interrupted, reflecting on their ability to captivate listeners. Engaging storytelling depends on creating stakes and moments of suspense, which keep audiences invested in the narrative.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Does that only work when it's complete opposites? Like Shane is not lazy or does it only work when there's like a really corresponding strong opposite to them?
  Speaker 1
  No, because I could say something like, and sometimes I do this, it's really weird, I actually teach people to practice this in a way that's weird. Like when I play golf, my coach will say, do this. And he goes, we're over-exaggerating it right now. Eventually we'll get it back to normal. I have people over-exaggerate it. So if I wanted to say the apple was red, you know, if I want to over-exaggerate that and get really good at this, I'd say the apple wasn't yellow and it wasn't it was red. So red, yellow, and green are not opposites of each other, they're just different colors, but you can still do it that way. I might not do it in that instance that would start to make me sound weird, but actually my people, I coach, I have them do that for a week. I say, I want you to never say what it is, I want you to say what it isn't. Just in an effort to get used to it so that when you speak, there's people who just speak dynamically and there's people who speak flatly. And I think the dynamic speakers are the ones who are always trying to energize their sentences by doing things like that.
  Speaker 2
  What else goes into teaching people how to tell effective stories?
  Speaker 1
  Knowing what a story is is really important. So understanding as you move through your that there's moments happening to you and those are the things that are worth sharing. I just spoke to a guy two days ago. He's going to be leading a conference, a whole bunch of people. He's a guy who does this all the time. And he met with me because he said I'm out of stories. He said I used all my stories in the last conference so I need new stories. And I said how long was the last conference? And he said two days. Then he ran out of all the stories of your life in two days? He did. Right? That's the problem often is we just don't have enough stories to tell. If we start to recognize that our lives are filled with stories, that they're everywhere, that we don't need enormous moments in order to carry the day. And instead, small moments are actually some of the most powerful moments we can ever share. I would much rather share with you a tiny, seemingly insignificant moment that's filled with meaning rather than one of my crazy stories about the times I've died and been brought back To life. Those are fine stories, but they're not actually my go-to stories because they're a lot harder to relate to. I'd much rather tell you some tiny, seemingly insignificant moment that meant the world to me because that is more likely to relate to you. So paying attention to that is going to be really important. And then just establishing that mindset of what can I say next in order to keep the person listening to me. You know, and it's those stakes we've described, it's the idea of suspense, which is really powerful. And once you understand it, it's simple to use. It's simply the strategic exclusion of information alongside the strategic inclusion of information. That's what suspense is. It's, I'm going to tell you some of it, but not all of it. It's a metal object rather than saying spoon, right? Crossword puzzles are just suspense devices. They just say, there's a five letter word for the color blue. What is it? And now you have to know. And if you don't know what it is, it's suspenseful and almost frustrating that you don't know. And the beauty of suspense is the more information you provide, the greater the suspense increases. So if you don't know the five-letter word for blue and I say, oh, we figured out the first letter, it's an A, your suspense increases. You've either solved it and now you feel good because the solving of suspense makes an audience feel good. But also the perpetuation of suspense makes an audience feel good because they want you to keep talking, right? So eventually we discovered the word is Azure, but some people figured it out and feel good about themselves, and some people heard the word Azure and suddenly felt relief. But either way, I'm winning. So when we're speaking, we just have to ask ourselves all the time, if the power goes out now, will people care? Twice in my life I've been in a movie where the power's gone out, has that ever happened to you? No. Maybe because I live in New England and we have a lot of weather. It's like thunder and lightning so I'm like super worried the power's gonna go out right now. But yeah. Well twice in my life it's happened with a movie. The first time I was alone watching a movie, power goes out, manager comes in and says you can come back tomorrow or later today, see the movie. I never went back because I didn't care about the characters. The power went out and I literally was happy that the story was over. The second time I was with my daughter, the power went out, we lost our minds. I was like, maybe we should go to another movie theater. Let's just go find another movie theater that has power so we can find out the end of this movie. That filmmaker had me on the edge of my seat. That filmmaker made me want them to continue talking. If we place that as our mindset, if the power goes out, will anyone care? I'm thinking that all the time. If the power goes out, I want everyone to stay right where they are and be waiting for me to get the microphone back on so I can finish my story.
  Speaker 2
  That's fascinating. When they test movies with focus groups, they should almost test halfway through sort of like a fake power outage and like, do people want to come back tomorrow and see the resolution Of the conflict?
  Speaker 1
  Yeah. Well, they do these registers where like how much you were liking the movie and how much you're not liking the movie. And depending on what kind of movie you're in, if they're not liking the movie, if I was paying attention, I would say, well, listen, you're missing one of the four things. There's either no stakes at this moment. We're not worried about anything. There's no suspense, right? We're not feeling a surprise coming or we're not laughing. And it's one of those four things. ([Time 1:10:10](https://share.snipd.com/snip/50b5dcad-e8e0-4c53-8769-5c4eeffd554f))
    - **Note:** Dynamic vs static speakers. Keep suspense and the tiny moment. If the power goes out in the middle of the story will you care. Stakes suspense surprise or laughing tennants of a story. Structure is vital as long as you structure a story to tap into these themes the story doesn’t even matter.
- A Simple Kiss Can Solve Complex Problems
  Summary:
  Sharing personal stories creates strong emotional connections and memorable insights.
  Using simple, relatable solutions, like kissing a spouse every morning, can convey deeper lessons, making complex business concepts accessible. Vulnerability in storytelling resonates with audiences, ensuring that the key message—a singular solution can address significant challenges—remains memorable and impactful.
  This approach contrasts with the tendency to stick to business narratives that are often forgettable.
  By incorporating personal elements into professional discussions, stories become metaphors that encourage introspection and change, leaving lasting impressions that reverberate through people's lives.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  We'll start telling you who your friends are that you have in common. All of those features were designed so Facebook figures out that's the one bottleneck we have. That's what he wants to tell the, tell the audience. But he doesn't want to just use that story, he wants other things, right? So when I'm talking to him I say, well what are other examples of sort of singular solutions that you can think of? He gives me a business solution, which is just content matching. You already have your business example, the Facebook one, and it works really well. I think it's great. Like right away I went, uh-huh, yeah, okay, great. I said, what about in your personal life? Do you have a personal life, you know, simple solution that really changed things for you? He says, well, there was a point years ago when I was struggling with my marriage, you know, my wife and I were just not getting along. And we had gone to couples therapy and it wasn't seeming to work and one day he sat down with his buddy and his buddy said, are you kissing your wife every morning? And he said, no. And his buddy said, kiss your wife every morning, you know, and he said, what's that going to do? He said, just do it. And it changed everything for him. Somehow there was a lack of physical closeness and intimacy that was missing in the relationship. And a kiss in the morning started to change everything for them. I said, that's the story you should use. And he goes, I'm not using that story. He said, that's not like what the purpose of this business is. And I said, no one's going to remember your other business story. In fact, a lot of people aren't even going to remember the Facebook story. But if you want to land the idea that sometimes a singular solution can solve a big problem, you tell the story about kissing your wife in the morning and they'll never forget it. And they'll start kissing their wives in the morning and they will start telling other people to do so as well. You will have an echo through their lives. Now that's a metaphor, right? That's a metaphor for his Facebook example, which is what I said to him was the Facebook example matching theme, meaning, or message essentially is what's the theme, meaning, or message Of the Facebook story? A singular solution can sometimes solve a really complex problem. So let's find that in our personal life. Now I'm always fighting with business on this because they never want to bring their personal life into the business world, which is why they're round, white, and flavorless, why they're All forgettable, why everything they say is ultimately forgotten. Because we don't remember business stories, we don't remember most of them. And there's so many of them. But a guy who gets on stage and is vulnerable enough to say a few years ago I was having a problem with my wife and she was having a problem with me and we were not getting along and things were Looking bad. And then I told my buddy and I end up kissing her and somehow today we're the happiest couple in the... That's unforgettable. Now, I think he's gonna do it. But part of me thinks he just told me he's gonna do it and he's not gonna do it. That happens all the damn time. I don't understand why people don't see it because I know you see it. Like you made a sound, right? I listened to audiences. When I said, do you kiss your wife every morning, you made a sound. You went, mmm. Which said to me, that's all I need to know. The story is perfect, right? When you hear that sound from an audience, you know, you have found the perfect story for this example. And if he was you, and I was telling him the story, he would make that sound. He'd go, hmm. But for some reason, because he has to tell it now, he can't do it because I can't tell a personal story. I'm there to teach them about solving business problems and bottlenecks, right? And I'm like, you are? But we don't teach lessons, like, always by sticking to the content, right? We have to expand beyond it to get people to understand it. Particularly when things get complex, when your business is different than mine, you know, you have a platform and I have a broom company. How are we going to talk to someone who's working for Slack and someone who's working for a broom company, right? If both of those people are in front of us and we're trying to improve their businesses, how are we going to do that? We're going to use metaphors. We're going to find ways to send lessons and messages to people in ways that resonate in their lives. Now, the beauty of that story too, and all the stories I teach, like the story of Boris, you know, the one you mentioned about the baseball game. When we do that, when we're daring enough courageous enough to do it, we create these markers in people's lives as well. The next time one spouse kisses another spouse in the morning, they're thinking about him and they're thinking about simple solutions to solve bottlenecks. It's going to continue to reverberate.

- Embrace Fear to Find Freedom
  Summary:
  Confidence is essential for public speaking and storytelling, enabling vulnerability and connection with the audience.
  True freedom comes from not caring about others' opinions, which can feel liberating yet complicated. Critical transformative experiences, such as facing extreme fear or life-threatening situations, can shift one's perspective on what truly matters.
  Teaching confidence might be less about imparting skills and more about navigating personal fears, similar to the experience of jumping off a high dive where initial fear is prevalent but ultimately fades with repetition.
  Sharing vulnerabilities fosters deeper connections, as most individuals grapple with feelings of shame and insecurity.
  When people reveal their true selves, they often discover acceptance rather than judgment, encouraging authenticity. Sharing personal stories, even the uncomfortable ones, can resonate with others and dispel the notion of isolation in one's struggles, ultimately enriching human experience and emphasizing the value of openness.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  How do we teach confidence to get on stage, to tell a story, to have the ability and not only to get on stage and tell a story, but to be vulnerable. It requires a certain degree of confidence in the audience.
  Speaker 1
  I know. And yourself. Get asked inevitably if I work with someone long enough by every client if I can help them learn how to be confident. I have more confidence than I need, my wife will tell you. If I could teach people how to be confident, like a magic pill, I would be the richest person on the planet because it is the most powerful thing you can have. When you genuinely don't care what other people think most of the time, my wife will tell you, it's extraordinary and terrible, depending on the day. And that's very true. Sometimes when I, you know, I genuinely don't care about most of what people think, it allows such freedom in life, but also, as my wife will say sometimes, is disastrous.
  Speaker 2
  Are you born that way or is that something you learn? Like, how do you teach people not to care about what other people think?
  Speaker 1
  Well, I used to think and I still kind of think, most of it happened for me when I was, you know, around the age of 21, I was in an armed robbery. I was managing a McDonald's restaurant. After closing, three men broke through the glass and came into the restaurant. And I knew I was in a lot of trouble because the police had come and they had told me about these guys. They had already killed two people. So when I heard the glass break, I knew what was going on. I was sort of managing the safe at the time, collecting all the money. And for reasons I will never understand, I had a deposit of about $7,000 in my hand in a bag. When I heard the glass break, I took it and I reached to the back of the safe and I dropped it down the chute into the box that I did not have a key for. You know, a little placard on the box said manager does not have key. They got to me, they put me on the floor, they told me to open the box because they figured out there's not enough money in the safe. I told them I can't and they began beating me. And eventually one of them put a gun into my head and said I'm going to count back from three and then I'm going to pull the trigger and I'm going to shoot you if you don't open the box. And then they counted back from three and he pulled the trigger on an empty gun. And I kind of fell apart at that moment. And I tried to crawl away and they pulled me back and then the guy I was afraid of, the guy I was afraid of all of them, there's one, you know, there's just one I'm like, that's the one that You don't, that's the one I don't want to deal with. And that was the one who put a gun to me ahead and said, this one's loaded and now I'm really going to blow your hat off if you don't open the safe. Afraid and I wasn't angry. The only thing I felt was regret for what I had not accomplished yet. That I was 20 years old. I was on a greasy tile floor at the back of a McDonald's restaurant. I had just been homeless like six weeks before. I was actually awaiting trial for a crime I did not commit. My life was a disaster. I had all these dreams and I knew with absolute certainty that I was going to die in that moment and I just felt I haven't done anything. And then he pulled the trigger on an empty gun again which you know resulted in a lifetime of PTSD. But it's a trigger in my life that suddenly made everything help seem unimportant. Like nothing seems to matter very much. I get yelled at by my fellow teachers. Some of my teacher friends say, Matt doesn't care about anything. There's an A schedule, B schedule, and C schedule. You guys have to figure out who's going to get which schedule. And I'll say, I don't care what schedule I get. And they get mad at me for not caring. But I'm like, that's a not a relevant thing. And so, you know, what I tell people is that sort of a moment where other people's concern what I looked like or thought or did all just washed away. But oftentimes I'm saying, listen, there's not a gun to my head, I'm not about to die, so this is nothing. And sometimes it's not true. Sometimes it is something. So and my wife will say, that can't be the level for everything and she's right. And sometimes it is something and I have to acknowledge that. With all of that said, my brother and sister would tell you that when Matt was a kid, he just didn't care what other people thought either. And maybe that was what is in me a little bit. I was the oldest of three and then later five growing up in a home that sort of didn't have very much parental support. I was sort of taking care of myself at a early age and I suspect that when you're nine and you're trying to find food and take care of your siblings and you know, going to your sister's parent Teacher conference because you know that the parents aren't going to go to the conference so maybe you can figure out what's going on. Like I think maybe that helps a little bit too. So I think it's a, the problem with all of that is to say it's I don't know how teachable it is. Public speaking is very difficult and storytelling is even more difficult because you have to be vulnerable. It's kind of like going off a high dive. You know, when I was growing up, there was a 14 foot high dive at the town pool, which would absolutely not be allowed today. It was very dangerous when you went off it. Like you always had to hold your hands out or you'd smash your head into the bottom of the pool. But I remember standing there and watching kid after kid after kid go off that high dive and everyone was fine. They also aimed at the surface jumped out of the water did it again. And finally I decided to do it. And even when I was up there and I knew everything was gonna be fine and I'd seen a million kids do it before me, it was still terrifying. And eventually I just had to go off and hit the water. And the second time, it was still terrifying. Even though I had just done it and it didn't kill me, I had to do it a whole bunch of times before I finally was able to just go off and not care. And I often think that's what I'm trying to get people to do. I can't make the fear go away the first time. You just have to go off the diving board and see that it worked out okay. And the beauty of it is if you stand on a stage and you share something vulnerable, and I have lots of people who have experienced this, you share something vulnerable, the response you Get is extraordinary. Oftentimes when people share something like that, they're worried they're going to be judged for the stupidity, the shame, the ridiculousness. But we just all walk around with that. We're all walking around with something that we think we're the only one who does. And it's never true, but the problem is so few people are willing to speak about their stupidities and their shames and their foolishnesses that the people who are willing to do it are Really valued in this world because they make the world easier for everyone else. And I've never had, never in my life have I ever said somethin... ([Time 1:32:30](https://share.snipd.com/snip/24fce89b-73c6-4504-aa42-f2017b065c72))
    - **Note:** Not caring what people think and embracing not caring about fear. Teaching confidence. Vulnerability opens rooms.
- Embrace Imperfection for Genuine Connection
  Summary:
  Imperfections enhance the beauty of communication, fostering a sense of authenticity and connection between the speaker and the audience.
  Instead of delivering rehearsed, memorized speeches, effective speakers engage with their audience by adapting their message in real-time, making it feel personal and relevant. This connection is cultivated through spontaneous interactions, corrections, or repetitions that signal to the audience that the speaker is genuinely present and invested in the moment.
  The emphasis should be on storytelling rather than reciting material, allowing for a more relatable and human experience.
  Understanding the specific audience and tailoring messages accordingly further enriches this interaction, transforming a performance into a shared experience that resonates deeply with listeners.

  Speaker 1
  She said, you did a great job. I said, fine. And she said to me, it's in the imperfection that the beauty lies. Because the imperfection tells us you had not memorized that thing. You remembered it. And then you realized in the midst of the story that you had forgotten something and you went back and caught it and then moved on. And that made everyone feel like you were speaking to them and not at them. And I always think about that. The imperfection is the beauty.
  Speaker 2
  Go deeper on this speaking to people and not at them.
  Speaker 1
  Speaking at them is the idea that it's almost irrelevant who's in front of me. 90 entrepreneurs at a conference or 2,000 people at the Brooklyn Academy of Music or six people in a library, you know, and all of those are audiences I speak to. Someone who has a sort of memorized speech, I know authors who have them, you know, authors who have their speech that they take wherever they go and it never changes because they've Crafted it, memorized it, and they deliver it. That's speaking at an audience, meaning nothing's gonna change. I'm here to say words, I'm gonna basically say them to the middle distance, and when I'm done, I will take a few questions and I will go home, right? That's at. If you're speaking to an audience, people know right away that what I'm hearing tonight will not be the same thing he says tomorrow night, and it's in those imperfections that people Will detect that. Stopping a sentence to correct what you just said or circling around or even repeating yourself accidentally and then saying, oh, I already told you that I'm sorry. Like, that's a beautiful thing because then they know it's for them, right? People want to know that when you're speaking, it's specifically for them. Like, I've brought this part of me to you and it's never going to be this way again. It's going to be the same stuff, but it's going to be done in a very different way tomorrow. And I might leave something out, put something new in, which I often do, but that's the difference between speaking to the middle distance regardless of who's in front of you or looking At people and saying who are they. I once did a show at the Brooklyn Historical Society. I went there with a story to tell for a moth story slam and I'd never been there before. It was like a one-time deal and when I got in and looked at the audience, they were basically all blue-haired old ladies and I thought, the story I have is not going to be appreciated by These ladies. It was a sort of raunchier story, like it just wasn't going to work. But because I don't memorize my stories, I spent 15 minutes pulling out all the humor that I knew wouldn't land and leaning into the heart instead. And I won that slam. And it was absolutely not the story I would ever tell the next night. No one laughed at the story that night and yet they loved it. The next night, if I tell it, everyone's gonna be roaring with laughter and they're going to love it. And that's the difference between speaking, you know, to an audience versus an audience.
  Speaker 2
  So if I come to you and I'm an author and I say, listen, I don't talk, I don't do talks, but I need to write really compelling stories, what are the key points that you would get me to learn Or understand?
  Speaker 1
  The first thing I would do is, especially for an author, I'd say let's tell stories. So we're not going to read from our book because no one has ever wanted that in the history of the world. Let's tell stories and let's find interesting stories about how your book got written. Moments along the way. ([Time 1:42:24](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4da6e5ce-f9e2-4461-8c19-6d0b55054101))
    - **Note:** Imperfection is beauty don’t reverse stories but tell them. Speak to not at people.
- Craft the Punch: Write with Impact
  Summary:
  Effective writing mimics the physicality of performance, utilizing sentence and paragraph structure to enhance emotional impact.
  Standalone sentences can deliver a powerful punch, capturing attention and retaining reader interest. Writers should prioritize the arrangement of their points to maximize suspense and humor, avoiding conventional structures like topic sentences that lead to predictability and disengagement.
  By placing significant statements at strategic points, like at the end of a paragraph, they ensure that readers absorb the essential message.
  This approach empowers readers, inviting them to engage and infer meaning, thus creating a more dynamic storytelling experience.

  Speaker 1
  But on the page, we can use a few more so that can be helpful. The paragraph and sentence structure oftentimes can replace intonation and pacing. What I'm always fighting with my editors on is, single sentence should be part of the previous paragraph. And I say, no, it should not, because I wanted to stand out in the way I would punch the sentence if I was speaking it. So if you look at the way I write, especially today, actually, if you compare my first novel to my latest novel, you'll see an enormous difference because this understanding has come To me. I can craft the sentences and the paragraphs to look such a way that it can provide some of the humor and some of the suspense. That's why I hate closed captions. My kids watch everything with closed captions all the time and I can't stand it because it gives the joke away all the time, right? You see the joke before the person says the joke, but that's how sometimes people write, which is they don't allow the punch to stand alone. They lose the punch in the previous paragraph of, you know, the eight sentences and the punch is the last one. And as they take the punch out and make it its own paragraph, it looks weird in the eyes of an editor because it is associated with the paragraph before. But I say I'm not interested in that. I'm interested in the physical effect that the reader has when they finish the paragraph and then bang, there's another sentence there all by itself in a way that I love. It's also the reason I drop subjects all the time in sentences. So rather than saying, I went to the store, especially if I'm emailing people, I'll say, went to the store rather than I went to the store because I want to punch right away. I want to get into the sentence quicker and I want them to feel the action of it. So you can start to think about things like that when you're writing to sort of bring some of those things that we get to use on a stage, you know, onto the page. A simple version would be someone would say, use italics and bold and that's fine, but like I kind of feel like that's a 400 year old trick that's been used for a very long time. And I think sometimes it actually doesn't work. It feels almost corny to suddenly land on italicized words or that would much rather be doing the things like I've described. So thinking about the way the print lands on a page can really make a difference in the way that it's affecting a reader.
  Speaker 2
  That's really interesting. I think also sort of like your topic sentence for a paragraph pulls people in or sort of like a lot of people just read the first sentence. And so when you put the final point at the end of a paragraph that's five or six sentences, you're losing a certain percentage of your audience along the way because they're reading the
  Speaker 1
  First sentence and they're like, okay, I get this paragraph, I'll go to the next paragraph. Right. And so they missed that point. Common mistake with storytellers all the time is I teach them, you've been taught to write in a boring way, which is topic sentence and supporting details. That's a disastrous way to write because you're right. Once you present the topic sentence, people know you're going to provide some evidence. And unless I'm like a nerd who wants to know the efficacy of the evidence, I'm moving on. So in storytelling, we never start with a topic sentence. If I want to say I had a really rotten grandmother, right? I would never start the sentence with, my grandmother was a terrible person and then list the way she was terrible. That's how you were taught to write, but that's a terrible way to write. Instead, I would say my grandmother did this to me, my grandmother did this to me, my grandmother did this to me. And then the last sentence might be my grandmother was a terrible person or I might say to myself as the writer or the storyteller, I've made my point. I'm gonna allow that topic sentence to go unsaid because I think they're gonna know it already. And audiences love that. They want to put things together on their own. But you're right, when you lead with a topic sentence, you've kind of failed most of the time. Now there are times when this appropriate if you're writing for a newspaper, right? If you're writing scientific things. ([Time 1:48:11](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e43a6749-5d89-44f1-957e-89d274b89d6f))
