- Authenticity Over Hierarchy: The Direct Voice of Founders
  Summary:
  Founders must be accountable for their unique vision and secret knowledge, which should not be diluted through layers of communication.
  Effective transmission of ideas requires direct engagement, bypassing excessive intermediary roles that often distort the original message. Despite the norm of relying on multiple layers within professional companies, this practice leads to a watered-down narrative.
  Many communicators in corporate settings lack a definitive, analytical approach to communication, resulting in imitation rather than innovation.
  The contemporary landscape, characterized by the transition from social media to AI-driven, hyper-personalized content, poses challenges with information overload and trust issues, making it crucial for founders and communicators to maintain authenticity in their messaging.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  The founder has to be accountable for the story. The founder holds this secret knowledge and this vision that other people don't. If that's not true, you have no business starting a company. Get out of here and go work at IBM. Get a job. Unless you have that secret knowledge and that secret vision and something to bring to the world that's new, you have no business being a founder. So everybody that has business being a founder knows something that everybody else doesn't know. I'm belaboring that point because it's really important to me. The core thing to internalize is if you have that knowledge, you cannot then transmit it through seven other layers until it becomes something that is fully familiar to people and fits Fully into some comfortable narrative that already exists. Out a way to speak to people directly with your voice, your passion, your vision, and not have it trickle down too far because you lose the thing that's special. There can be too many middlemen such that by the time your message reaches people, it's been watered down beyond recognition and it's not special anymore.
  Speaker 2
  What would you say the norm is?
  Speaker 1
  Norm is using a ton of middlemen. If you look at a professional company that has all of its layers and structures in place, the CEO tells maybe a CMO or a VP of comms who then tells the person who's in charge of corporate Comms, who then tells the person who's in charge of media relations, who then pitches a reporter, and then they'll find a reporter who already wanted to write something similar because They have a narrative already in mind, and then it's beamed through the prism of that reporter's worldview to specific readers of that publication, and then those readers get that Version. And you can even hear through the process of me describing this how contorted it is along the way. Today, there's absolutely no need to do that. Not only do you not need to do that, you shouldn't be relying on that. You can do it every once in a while. You might need to reach policymakers in DC and they do read, let's say, the Wall Street Journal and you got to be in there, but you can't just be doing that. That's maybe 1% of the playbook.
  Speaker 2
  — Why is it so pervasive then? If it's so ineffective, how has it gotten to the place that so few follow your advice?
  Speaker 1
  — I think people are larping as communicators and as executives. There's never been a real playbook for comms that is analytical, grounded in reasoning and logic and first principles that has intellectual rigor. And there have been some great, great PR and propaganda people throughout history and they've had their own playbooks, but there is no definitive best practice to doing something. It's not like math. People will just look to other people doing it and everybody is kind of a pale shadow of someone who came from before. If you would trace it all the way back, maybe we're all larping as Edward Bernays or something. But it becomes one of these things where there's four mice and they like to run on a treadmill and you take them out one by one and put in new mice. And then pretty soon, all the new mice are imitating the old mice and they don't know why. And I think that's what's been happening in a corporate setting, probably for a lot of other roles as well, but especially for coms.
  Speaker 2
  Bernays is interesting because so much about what made him singular and original was technology around him, the ability to disseminate new messages to masses through new technology. And obviously today we've got a very unique landscape. What about today's landscape of where and how information flows is most important and interesting to you?
  Speaker 1
  So we're between two worlds today. I'm not even talking about traditional media versus social media. That's the old, old world is traditional media transitioning to social media. I think where we are today is social media transitioning to AI-driven, hyper-personalized, very prolific, where you can't tell human-made from AI-made very soon, media, whatever The term will be for that. It's a combination of information overload, trust breaking down, AI slop, very persuasive, real and fake versions of things. We're right in the middle of that. And the key technologies are social media, generative AI, and this is not a technology, but influencers and individuals as mediums. ([Time 0:06:53](https://share.snipd.com/snip/02be11f6-4cb1-4ba3-b375-d68b9253b4f4))
    - **Note:** The founder has to be accountable and must tell the story. In communication we’re moving from an era of social media to AI driven content with influencers. Influencers as their own medium. You must work hard to fully control the narrative. Good comms are rooted in ownership become soviegn and independent own the narrative and situation
- Know Your Audience and Craft the Message
  Summary:
  Founders must embrace the responsibility of being visionaries and ensure their company has clear goals.
  Understanding the audience is critical; engaging the wrong people can be more detrimental than apathy. Focus on true supporters, while recognizing that haters are often irredeemable and should not be a primary concern.
  Instead, prioritize swing voters who have potential alignment.
  Successful messaging requires identifying the right mediums for outreach, understanding audience preferences, and delivering compelling content that resonates with their cultural touchpoints.
  The formula for effective communication involves a hook that aligns with their interests, a relatable bridge to transition their perspective, and the introduction of new concepts, ensuring familiarity while presenting innovative ideas.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So number one is the founder knows what they're about and they're willing to take on the responsibility of being the keeper of the vision and the message. Two is the company has to have clear goals that they're working toward. Three, related to two, is you have to know the audience and know your audience is actually a cliche at this point. It's become so much of a truism that it's faded into the ambient background and people don't think about it enough. Maybe we should rebrand it or something so it becomes fresh and salient again. But know your audience is important because if you're talking to the wrong people, it's worse than talking to nobody, partly because of the expended time and partly because you might Be making new enemies or making unwanted friends that then tie you down in unpredicted ways. So I think of the audiences as here are the people who actually have a say in the future of the company. If my goal is to get more users, then these are the users and I care about them and people who are not users, I literally don't care about them. If I have to make them mad in order to please the users, I will make that choice without hesitation. So there's the people that you really care about. Then there's the haters. And every founder has haters. And the bigger founder you are, the more haters you'll have. And as the company grows, the corpus of haters will grow. Most of these haters are irredeemables, the David Petraeus term for people you can't convert. Every once in a while, you hear wonderfully inspiring stories about, I used to be a hater, and then I came around. It's so rare that I actually don't recommend expending much energy on it. If you have the opportunity to convert someone okay but I wouldn't make it a core part of your strategy to convert people who hate you. Letting them attack you until they overstep in order for you to round up your true allies. That's a good use as oil. And then there's the swing voters. It's the people who actually could be your people, but they just don't know it yet. Just like in an election, the swing voters are deserving a disproportionate amount of attention. That's your audience. And then last, I would say your medium and your hook. You need to reach people where they intellectually hang out. So the type of person who hangs out on Reddit or listening to Joe Rogan or listening to NPR or going to conferences or reading The New York Times, these are different people who get their Ideas in different places. If you're trying to reach someone who reads Gorn and you're in The New York Times, again, you're just screaming into the void. So the medium and the messenger of who they're hearing this from and where they're hearing it is the key for whether it actually reaches them and they'll absorb it.
  Speaker 2
  I love the ingredients. One of the things to double click on is the message itself. And I always think about, I think it was Graydon Carter's rules for content, which was narrative conflict and proprietary information. You want to have all three of them in a message. How do you think about the most well constructed packets to then send through all these different channels to meet the customer or the person you need to influence where they are? What are the key components of a great hook, I think is what you called it?
  Speaker 1
  Graydon-Carter trifecta is good for news and breaking news. And in an age where you had to break news in order to justify the inches and the columns, that totally makes sense. Today, we're moving more toward opinions and personalities. I don't think that formula is necessary anymore. It's a formula, but even newspapers are moving more toward opinions and editorial. A new way to think about it would be, I don't have the catch phrases yet, maybe we can make up the catch phrases. The way I describe it is that you need to know their cultural erogenous zones, what they care about and what they think about. Then you need a gateway drug. Sometimes I'll describe it as an API, but you basically need a bridge from what they're currently thinking about and caring about to bridge them to the new thing that you want them to Think about and care about. At the very beginning of this conversation, I said that the founder has something new and secret to share with the world that people don't already know. And that's the whole point is that it's different. You also can't just blast somebody with something they've never heard of before. You have to give them something in there that's familiar or related to something they already care about. And so I think the formula would be the hook, and the hook has to relate to what their cultural origin zone is, and you have to be in their culture to understand that, then the gateway drug Or the bridge, the segue, and then the new thing that you want them to understand or think about. ([Time 0:15:43](https://share.snipd.com/snip/be082a42-6935-403b-a851-8d7f174fb1af))
    - **Note:** Founder responsibility clear goals and know your audience reach the right people not just anyone. Hook understand cultural origin zone then the hook the transitions them to bridge them yo what you’re doing different.
- Master the Art of Reading the Room
  Summary:
  The illusion of transparency highlights the importance of clarity in communication; individuals often mistakenly believe others can read their thoughts, leading to misunderstandings.
  Effectively reading the room is a crucial skill for addressing audience perceptions and ensuring messages land as intended. In the context of launching products, understanding the current landscape and audience sentiment can differentiate successful launches from mediocre ones.
  With increased competition and noise, establishing a strong presence through thoughtful launches is imperative.
  Crafting a compelling narrative around a product, bolstered by a well-prepared strategy that includes briefing allies, enhances the likelihood of success.
  Selecting the right media contacts can significantly impact visibility, prioritizing genuine enthusiasm and knowledge over mere metrics. A credible press presence is shaped not only by the media outlet but also by the relationships built within it, ensuring messages reach appropriate audiences without distortion. In today's fast-paced environment, neglecting to actively shape your narrative can result in others defining it for you, making proactive and engaging communication strategies essential.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Have you heard of the illusion of transparency? There's different words for it, but you've probably felt it. Let's say you and I are chatting and you say a thing that completes a thought that's in your head, and I'm completely lost, or there's a misunderstanding. I take it wrong. I get my feelings hurt. It's you assuming that the outside world can know what's in your mind, and you forgot to complete the thought, or you didn't read the room properly because you're too much living inside Your own head. And that's easy for anybody else to do. So part of our job actually is reading the room, figuring out what the room is and then getting inside of it and then reading it and then reporting back to figure out, okay, if you're going To launch, these are the people, this is what they're talking about right now. This is what they care about. This thing that was cool two weeks ago when we started talking about this has actually turned cringe in the meantime. We're not going to go with that anymore. So hyper reading the room is an important skill. And then I have my co-founder, Sergey, and he's the CTO of our firm. He's my autism translator. I will talk to and listen to one set of people more and he'll talk to and listen to another set of people more. And between us, I think we've got a pretty wide spectrum of text. So the reading the room exercise we do together.
  Speaker 2
  And people are vying to one up each other on the more impressive launch. The Cognition launch comes to mind with their product, Devon, which was obviously well done just based on the insane number of impressions and discussions and comparisons that it Made possible. And I'm curious how much of something like that is luck or attributable to real skill behind the scenes. Obviously, it's a blend of the two. It seems like there's this launch arms race. And I'm just curious for you to zoom in on launch and what you think separates the great from the good.
  Speaker 1
  Launches are more important now than they used to be. So sometimes when you ask people do launches matter, they'll say, no, do you remember when Airbnb first launched? Remember when Facebook first launched? It doesn't matter. It actually matters a little bit more now because there's so much more noise. And because the bar has been raised, it's important to take it seriously. The other thing with startups is if you're starting from nothing and nobody cares about you and you have no name recognition and your family thinks you're worse than unemployed for Working on this thing. Makes no sense to anybody because it's new and nobody's heard of it, you can use every opportunity to make people care that you can have. And the launch is the first of those. Introducing yourself to the world in a proper way is the first of those. The last reason that the launch is so important is now if you don't quickly establish what you're about, you don't have the luxury of quietly building for a long time and then just gradually Shaping the perception. Somebody else will just do it for you. There are so many competitors and reporters and independent writers and influencers and gossips, especially in AI. We do a lot of work in AI, and the scuttlebutt in AI is intense. It's the biggest water cooler in the world. Everybody's gathered around, and word will get out, and it'll be this contorted, distorted version that doesn't represent what you want, and then you'll spend a lot of time trying To put that back and clean up and start over. So come out strong with the thing that you stand for. When we work at the companies on launches, I recommend they write a manifesto. I don't want to live in a world where everybody's writing a manifesto for everything all the time, but it is good as a forcing mechanism, if nothing else, to write down what you stand for And what you value, and then come out either with those words or something that reflects those words. Launches do matter, and they matter more than they did before. And if you don't launch yourself, somebody will launch you for you at some point. So you got to do it even if just defensively. On launches, luck versus skill for the Devon launch. 99% was the cognition guys built Devon. They built something genuinely great and new and impressive. Then out of that remaining 1%, I would say half of it is, we did a good job. And then half of it was luck. There's always animal spirits on social media. You can't fully predict. Now if we zoom in on the half percent that I would attribute to skill, what goes into that half percent. It's having a very clear story about what this is. So everything and every person is a thousand things. You could describe yourself in a thousand ways if you were forced to. There's enough material there. Every product or company can be described in a thousand different ways. The taste and discretion and creativity in describing it in the single best way and choosing the number one best one out of the thousand is where a lot of that skill lies. This founder mode essay, PG's essay that went viral over the weekend, I think more than half of that was a great name. It was simple, it was familiar, people understood it, but it was also new. And so Derek Thompson at The Atlantic has written a whole book about what makes things go viral and he talks about blending the novel with the familiar and that being a magic formula. Finding a way to describe what you're doing that is simple, crisp and familiar, but novel is a big part of it. Teing up your allies is a big part of it. You can't just put something out into the world and if you say it, they will listen and hope that all your friends will rally to you. It takes some time. And in the case of cognition, it took between a month and two months to brief some people and prep some people and get people ready. There are people who are latently happy to support you, but they might not know how and they might not be ready to do it, and you can help them help you. Then there's the normal logistics stuff of the site should look how you want it to look, and your post should sound how you want it to sound. The video should be what you want it to be. If you're going to do press, choose the right reporter. Reporter selection is probably the number one thing in press. People stress a lot about the pitch and the prep and what do I say in the interview. If you choose the right reporter, what you say in the interview matters a lot less.
  Speaker 2
  What are the characteristics of the right reporter? Is it different in every scenario or is it often the same talented few reporters?
  Speaker 1
  It's different reporters, but I think it's the same criteria. Traditionally, you would start with what's the outlet, what's the beat, and who's the reporter. I think now it's flipped because we've gone from institutions to individuals. So start with who are the people who are knowledgeable i... ([Time 0:23:21](https://share.snipd.com/snip/af888383-c1ee-4442-ba1c-bc82d00393e5))
    - **Note:** The illusion of transparency when something makes sense in your head not the world. The launch is vital you need to prepare the world to hear you which isn’t as easy as you think. World is much more complex. Write a manifesto get on the right terms have a clear vision. Go to the right reporters to get the word out.
- Stand Firm in Crisis: Know Your Truth
  Summary:
  In managing crises, it is crucial to address the situation based on the fundamental truth of whether wrongdoing occurred.
  If guilty, openly apologize; if innocent, resist pressure to apologize insincerely. The focus should be on integrity and reputation rather than merely minimizing legal risks.
  Acknowledging the entire spectrum of factors influencing decision-making—including long-term impact on reputation and moral standing—is vital.
  Proactively manage potential crises by preparing a crisis plan and conducting simulations to ensure efficient responses.
  Leadership traits such as trustworthiness and charisma are essential during crises; leaders must embody the behavior expected of their teams. Ultimately, a well-prepared leader who understands the ground truth will navigate crises effectively while maintaining credibility.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  What do you think about getting through crises? It seems like one approach lately has been like just post through it. Don't even acknowledge some negative story or something. Just keep going. That's one method. Another method might be attack it head on, especially if you've got the facts on your side. Famously in the investing world, this would be like fighting against short sellers or something that release a really nasty story about your business. Is there any lessons you've learned on managing through a crisis and communications through a crisis that you think are important for founders to understand?
  Speaker 1
  Don't listen to your lawyers and never apologize if you didn't do something wrong and if you don't mean it because you'll regret it later. If you talk to founders who apologize for something at the time, the woman who was kicked out of the wing, for example, she went back later and said she wished she hadn't done that whole Routine. They always regret it because you compromise yourself and you do compromise yourself for nothing. Because an apology doesn't appease people, especially if you didn't do anything wrong and it's insincere. One, they can tell if you don't mean it, but two, if you didn't do anything wrong, then by definition, there's nothing to apologize for. So apologizing isn't going to change the situation. So do not apologize for something you didn't do wrong. If you did something wrong, apologize wholeheartedly. This is the Ben Horowitz, if you're going to eat shit, don't nibble. I subscribe to that. It starts with the ground truth of, did you mess up? If you did, apologize. If you didn't, don't apologize. It's so simple, and people get it so wrong. They'll start apologizing or not apologizing based on all sorts of other garbage factors. Who's mad at me? Am I getting ratioed? That's how they decide whether to apologize or not. Who gives a shit? Did you do something wrong or did you not? Don't compromise yourself. Don't sell out like that. So that's the biggest thing. Don't listen to what people tell you about what you should do to change the situation. Either you're wrong or you're not. At the end of the day, you got to be able to look at yourself in the mirror and know that you stood for something, you have principles. And if we all just go about caving and apologizing, if we didn't mean it, this world would just fall apart. What is the ground truth? Did you do something wrong? Number two, if yes, apologize wholeheartedly, if no, fight it. And the reason I say don't listen to your lawyers is not that I'm not a legal process enjoyer, but I do respect legal opinions and the law. However, what I mean is a lot of times the lawyers are optimizing for one thing, they're optimizing for minimize legal risk at all other costs. And this is the same thing where during COVID it was like minimize COVID transition at all other costs. We're going to close schools, kids are going to fall behind, people are going to have mental health crises, you're not going to be able to bury your grandmother, that's fine, minimize Transmission. That's not the right way to make decisions. And if you're a CEO, that's not the right way to make decisions because you need the whole picture. So if you're the CEO and the founder, minimizing legal risk is one consideration. Another consideration is principles and being true to yourself and doing what's right and courageous. Another consideration is your reputation long-term. You might do something that minimizes legal risk, like stay quiet and issue a really bland statement and go undercover for a while and don't apologize even if you messed up. But that actually could shred your reputation longer term, which could be way more expensive, both financially in terms of people will boycott you and not buy your product or not trust Your company or not accept the job offer. And on a moral level, you've just paid a really expensive price for something that could have been a temporary pain. Those are the biggest things in the crisis. I would say pragmatically, try to fight the crisis before it happens. If there is dry Tinder lying around you, do something about it before the hot summer day comes, before the campers come by. If you know that there's skeletons in the closet, deal with them, address them, have a crisis plan in place. I still do these tabletop war room exercises, the same type of thing that the Marine Corps would do. They do their better and more involved. I do a basic version, which is let's take a crisis scenario and it hits and then your senior team is in a room and now what do you do? Because people will realize in the moment that there are cracks in their plan. It'll be tiny things. You're my boss and it's 5am and I'm not sure whether to wake you. So I wait until 6 because that seems reasonable and now we've lost an hour because I didn't make the right call. These small things that you don't think of, all of that needs to be in place and thought of when the time comes so that everything that you can do on autopilot has to be done on autopilot Because all of your organizational, operational, and mental capacity has to be spent on dealing with the crisis.
  Speaker 2
  You sparked my memory. You mentioned counterterrorism earlier. Is there anything from that field that you're curious about that applies to all that we're talking about?
  Speaker 1
  With current insurgency, one of the big lessons is the importance of winning over the local population, the importance of winning over the tribal elders and the leaders in the community And getting to them because they'll propagate the message for you and they'll do it coming from them, which is way better than coming from you, because you're self-interested and you're Probably an outsider. So one is paying attention to those people. Going to one person who's considered an authority in a certain community is better than going to 200 or in the age of social media, maybe a thousand other people. Another thing is the importance of the leadership and the personality is paramount. So people have to trust you as an individual and trust you as a person in order to trust the organization that you lead. Charismatic leader is so important that one of the strategies in counterinsurgency is to get the leader because things fall apart. So for you to be a strong leader and for you to be the embodiment of how everybody else should be acting during this crisis is absolutely crucial. Sometimes it's tempting to be like, I can let my emotions take over because I've got advisors around me. Well, no, people aren't looking to your advisors for how to act. They're looking to you for how to act. ([Time 0:35:36](https://share.snipd.com/snip/832fb631-8f1b-4a31-bea1-fd3e1430b797))
    - **Note:** Plan for a crisis and only apologize if you did something wrong don’t apologize if you didn’t msss up and have a crisis plan in place when shit hits the fan to prevent it from doing so. And counter terrorism. Get the right people on your side and be a strong leader. Don’t run for problems. When you establish the when you hit we hit back twice as hard problems go away but when you show weakness people pounce. Run into the problem not from the problem
- Establish Your Unique Mission to Thrive
  Summary:
  Companies must articulate their unique right to exist in a crowded market by identifying what is missing in the world that only they can fulfill.
  It is crucial to demonstrate a distinct approach to solving problems, whether by applying new solutions to old challenges or applying traditional solutions to new issues. Founders should clarify why they are the best suited to tackle their business's challenges at this moment and should have a clear plan in place.
  Additionally, they need to define their principles and values to ensure alignment with potential investors, partners, and employees, as shared vision and compatibility are essential for successful collaboration.
  The ability to answer these foundational questions reinforces the company’s significance and can guide leaders in determining whether they should pursue their business efforts more seriously.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  You mentioned manifesto earlier. What question prompts would you offer people where if they answer those questions well, they'll have the component parts of a Manifesto?
  Speaker 1
  The first one is what gives you a right to exist? There's already 40,000 companies doing something like you, and then there's 15 companies doing what sounds exactly like what you're doing, and then there's three other companies That are literally doing exactly what you're doing, at least to the outside eyes. Why don't you just go join them? What gives you a right to exist and to take up space on this earth and to take up any of our time? The most important thing is what is missing in the world today that only you can fill? And a lot of companies are never able to answer that question. And it makes it hard to invest in that company. If I'm going to bet my career on you, I'm going to go leave Google to bet everything on you. Your equity will be the financial security for my kids and my grandkids. And you're telling me that you can't name something that would go missing in the world if you were to vanish tomorrow? Stereoliction. That question has to be answered for you to not only have a manifesto, but to have a company. The other which is related is, why can only you do this? And these things, you can write it down or not write it down, but you have to have an answer. The answer has to exist. Why are you the right person to do this right now? The next question would be, how are you approaching this, or how are you approaching it differently? Maybe it's a new problem, you're approaching it with an old way, or maybe it's the same problem, but you're approaching it in a new way, but what is your approach? How are you going about it? If you're going to get us to Mars, how are you getting us to Mars? And you don't have to share trade secrets or expose any part of the master plan that you don't want to, but people need to be convinced that the plan exists. And then the next one is, what are your principles and values? What do you believe? And if I were to invest in you or work with you or work for you or be a partner to you, what type of human being am I putting myself next to? Do you stand for what I stand for? Is your vision of the world similar to my vision? If you believe that you will only succeed in vision A of the world, but I happen to believe vision B, then we're incompatible and that's okay, but it's good to know that upfront.
