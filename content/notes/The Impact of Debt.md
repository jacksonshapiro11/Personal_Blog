- Leverage in Investing and the Importance of Prudent Decision-making
  Summary:
  The use of leverage in investing is a cyclical process that is influenced by market conditions.
  When things are going well, investors tend to view leverage positively, leading to increased interest in employing more leverage, relaxed regulations, and willingness from lenders to provide more. However, when events turn negative, the perception of leverage changes, leading to negative consequences for borrowers.
  It is crucial to understand that leverage magnifies gains and losses, necessitating cautious decision-making to optimize, not maximize, its use.
  Prudent use of leverage is essential to avoid ruin under extreme negative circumstances.
  It is advised to use leverage based on cautious assumptions, especially when dealing with novel, risky, or volatile assets. The key to survival lies in maintaining a margin of safety and using less leverage with riskier assets. Conservative assumptions may limit gains but can safeguard financial well-being in challenging times, emphasizing the importance of avoiding excessive risk-taking in investing.

  Attitudes that govern the use of debt capital are examples of this cyclical process. When things have been going well for a while, asset prices have been rising, investment returns have been positive, and the use of leverage has paid off in the form of higher returns, Investors view leverage as benign. As a result, the favorable aspects of leverage become well recognized. The negative potential is overlooked. Investors become interested in employing more. Lenders become willing to provide more, and regulations and moreays governing the use of leverage tend to become more permissive. But when events turn negative, this process goes into reverse. Leverage is penalized, not rewarded. Thus, it's used to clients. And importantly, lenders provide less and try to demand repayment of outstanding leverage if they can, leading to negative consequences for borrowers. In this way, as we so frequently see, psychology often strays from the happy medium and moves toward extreme highs, the presage painful losses when extreme lows are reached. The source of losses from excessive use of leverage might be best understood through an adaptation of my favorite new quote from Edward Chancellor's book The Price of Time, which I Cited in this past January's memo, Easy Money. The Manchester Banker, John Mills, commented perceptively in 1865 that, as a rule, panics do not destroy capital. They merely reveal the extent to which it has previously been destroyed by the taking on of excessive leverage in good times, using debt prudently. As with so many aspects of investing, determining the proper amount of leverage has to be a function of optimizing, not maximizing. Given that leverage magnifies gains when there are gains, and that investors only invest when they expect there to be gains, it can be tempting to think the right amount of leverage Is all you can get. But if you bear in mind, A, leverage is potential to magnify losses when there are losses, and B, the risk of ruin under extreme negative circumstances, investors should usually use Less than the maximum available. Successful investments, perhaps enhanced by the moderate use of leverage, should usually provide a good enough return. Having few people think about in good times. Here's how I summed it up in volatility plus leverage equals dynamite. Clearly, it's difficult to always use the right amount of leverage because it's difficult to be sure you're allowing sufficiently for risk. Leverage should only be used on the basis of demonstrably cautious assumptions. And it should be noted that if you're doing something novel, unproven, risky, volatile, or potentially life-threatening, you shouldn't seek to maximize returns. Instead, air on the side of caution. The key to survival lies in what Warren Buffett constantly harps on, margin of safety. Using 100% of the leverage one's assets might justify is often incompatible with assuring survival when adverse outcomes materialize. With the riskier the underlying assets, the less leverage should be used to buy them. Conservative assumptions on this subject will keep you from maximizing gains, but possibly save your financial life in bad times. The right way to think about debt may be best captured by one of the oldest maxims. There are old investors, and there are bold investors, but there aren't many old bold investors.
