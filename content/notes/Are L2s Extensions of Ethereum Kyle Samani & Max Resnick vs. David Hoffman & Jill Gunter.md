### Highlights

- Align Goals for Censorship Resistance and Composability
  Summary:
  Key goals for Ethereum and Layer 2 solutions include creating censorship-resistant applications, enhancing composability, and addressing value accrual in their ecosystems.
  While some Layer 2s focus on fostering cypherpunk values like those on Ethereum mainnet, there is a risk of fragmentation as they might develop isolated systems. Composability remains a major concern, driving initiatives like Espresso to address these challenges.
  Additionally, value accrual is crucial as competition rises with other blockchain networks, emphasizing the need for a cohesive and integrated approach to external growth and sustainability.

  I just want to build on that to come back to this question of what are the goals of Ethereum and what are the goals of L2s? I think we've named three different goals throughout this conversation so far. One would be to create censorship resistance applications. Now, that's not the goal of every L2, certainly the goal of some L2s. There are L2s that include Pernato Cash transactions. There are L2s building explicitly for even more kind of cypherpunk values than exist on Ethereum today, on the Ethereum mainnet. And so I would say that on that front, the goals are aligned and compatible between the mainnet and the L1 and the L2s, at least some of the L2s building upon it. A second goal that we've named now is composability. I think censorship, and composability are basically the two reasons that you have as a developer to build in Web3 or as a user to use Web3 apps. Composability to me is honestly still a big question mark. That is where I think there is a risk that L2s go off to build their own walled gardens. That is why I'm working on Espresso, to work to solve composability. And then there's a third question, which you mentioned earlier, that I think we've all been skating around, which is the question of value accrual. And that is the reason why everyone is sweating over this is because I think Bitcoin, Solana are each up like 40% in the last few months. And Ethereum, that meme where you're poking it with a stick saying do something.

  I think in the current state of Ethereum, we do have kind of this like blank step of, and then there's a perfectly composable Ethereum and there's like a missing step there. But nonetheless, we do see signs of internal composability across what Alex Glukowski is calling the clusters, the super chain, the elastic chain. There are pretty coherence.
