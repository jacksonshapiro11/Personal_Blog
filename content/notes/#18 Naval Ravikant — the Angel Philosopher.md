### Highlights

- Building Mental Models for Success
  Key takeaways:
  - Making decisions right 80% of the time is highly valued and compensated in the market.
  - Being right 10% more than someone else can be worth 100 million dollars on a judgment call.
  - Leverage of decision-making is increasing with modern technology and capital.
  - Improving decision-making skills can result in non-linear returns in life.
  - The brain is a memory prediction machine that tries to predict the future based on past experiences.

  Decision making is everything. And in fact, someone who makes decisions right 80% of time, so 70% of time will be valued and compensated in the market hundreds of times more. I think people have a hard time understanding that, but that's a fundamental fact of leverage. If I'm managing a billion dollars and I'm right, 10% more of the time than somebody else, and that's a hundred million dollars worth of value on a judgment call. And with modern technology and large workforces and capital, our decision is getting leveraged more and more. So if you can be more right, more rational, and that's one of the reasons why I love your blog, because it really focuses on helping you be more right, better decision making and more rational, then you're going to just get non-linear returns in your life. So decision making is everything. And decision making, what's going on? Basically, the brain is a memory prediction machine. It has a memory of things that work in the past and what it's read and it's trying to predict the future. And the lousy way to do memory prediction is X happened in the past, therefore X will happen in the future. It's too based on specific circumstances. So what you want is you want principle. You want mental models. So the best mental models that I have found have come through Evolution, Game Theory, and Charlie Munger, who I'm sure you quote a lot in your blog, but Charlie Munger was Warren Buckett's partner, very good investor, but he has tons and tons of great mental models. Naseem Taleb has great mental models. The Benjamin Franklin had great mental models. So I basically load my head full of mental models, but then different ones apply to every situation. So I don't really want to check list. But for example, I studied a lot of complexity theory when I was younger. It's a field that I got into. I got an occasion I just get into these things and I just learn a lot about that field. And my most recent one is cryptography, but I was really into complexity theory back in the mid 90s. And the more I got into it, the more I understand the limits of our knowledge and the limits of our prediction capability. And that's been super helpful to me. So that has helped me come to the system that operates in the face of ignorance. And I believe that fundamentally we're ignorant and very, very bad at predicting the future. So I don't look for, and I don't believe that I have the ability to say what is going to work. So rather what I try to do is I try to eliminate what's not going to work. So I think being successful is just about not making mistakes. It's not about having correct judgments, it's about avoiding the incorrect judgments. So I have mental models around how do I determine if I can trust somebody around what are the actual odds that this is going to work? How much margin of safety do I have? If it works out, the angel bets and venture bets are great because they've not been your outcome in the positive, but on the downside, you can only lose one X. But on the upside, you can make 10,000 X. So I try to rig the game. So I don't believe in specific goals. Scott Adams also set up systems, not goals. So use your judgment to figure out what kinds of environments you can thrive in and then build a system to create that environment around you so that you're statistically likely to succeed.

    - **Note:** Create systems not goals.
