  Speaker 1
  And he's elaborate that you'll never run out if you get married, and if you have kids, then then then you've got a gold mine. Ha ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
  Speaker 2
  You mentioned just a few minutes ago about word smithing until you get everything pleasing to the ear, and really obsessing over the the prose. I've read that one of your explanations for the success of all your television was that the show was successful because i micro managed it, every word, every line, every take, every Edit, every casting. And then later on, if you're efficient, you're doing it the wrong way. There are a lot of questions i could ask about this, but i suppose one is, if you are for such a period of time, i understand the logic of it, but for such a long period of time obsessing over The details like that, did you not find yourself at risk of burnout, or just hitting a point of overwhelm? Or did that not happen to you.
  Speaker 1
  Were talk about the series now, or just yo. We're taking about the series, the series o the series is, aa, you know, if you want to look at the comedy art is the only thing that interests me creatively, i think, or dony thing i'm any Good at.

    - **Note:** He forces himself to write every day he sits with nothing but a pad and coffee and sits there for hours he loves it but he could either do nothing or write. Stay curious success is the death of curiosity. He builds and lives by systems. Create structures and systems start with something you can do then grow from there. You need a reward at the end. Build simple systems. Be encouraging and kind to yourself. Failure shapes your life.
- Treat yourself like a baby and a hard-ass for writing success
  Summary:
  The key to writing success is treating yourself with extreme nurturing and love after writing, preserving the positive feeling by refraining from sharing your work for at least twenty-four hours.
  This helps avoid external influence that could taint your accomplishment. A critical aspect is to switch between being a supportive nurturer and a hard-edged critic while writing and editing, reflecting a balance in nurturing ideas and eliminating weak content.
  Repetition and systemization, akin to training a dog, are essential to mastering the brain for consistent productivity.
  Employing clear, step-by-step systems like the 'Body for Life' program aids in achieving goals effectively, eliminating confusion and enhancing progress.
  Feedback during the writing process primarily revolves around the audience, with little value in other forms of feedback. Accepting mediocrity and realizing that greatness comes from investing a significant amount of time and effort into a task is crucial. The importance of having structured systems, defined formats, and appropriate incentives, such as rewards, is highlighted for effective learning and productivity.

  Speaker 1
  So that's the beginning of a system that, to me, will help almost anybody learn to write, which is something, you know, i kind of wanted to teach, in a way, because i find it, i think it's So simple. I think exercise is pretty simple too. But people don't. They don't come up with good, simple, little systems. Just try and do. And that's, to me, that's ougin fail.
  Speaker 2
  The simple doesn't mean easy and do.
  Speaker 1
  No, no, me not easy.
  Speaker 2
  Sin o important. The incentives at having a reward, having a defined formet. How long did your daughter end up choosing for her writing duration, or howong long have you chosen?
  Speaker 1
  Hold it just doe, an hour. That's a lot. She says, i want to write all day. No, you're not. Nobody writes day. Shakespeare can't write all day. It's its its torture.
  Speaker 2
  Y, if you taught a class on writing, what other lessons might you have, or resources, or anything exercises. Some imagining that your daughter could sit down, she sesari to half an hour, and then you ask her how he writing session went. She said, while i didn't have any idea what to write. So you'd have, i don't know what age the students would be in your cours, but what else would be a component of your class on writing?
  Speaker 1
  Well, i would teach them to learn to accept your mediocrity. You know, no one's really that great. You know who's great? The people that just put a tremendous amount of ours into it. It's a game of tonnage. You know, how many totals are you going to work per week, per month, per year? You might even want to chart that. Or with your exercise, if you want to get in shape, i couldn't get in shape. I was like, a start as a jogger, you know, like in the seventies, and i would run three miles a day. And then i got older, and i got married late, and i had young kids, and i really had to get in shape. And i picked up this book by bill phillips called body for life, body for life. And it's really, really so it's such a system for a primitive, you know, brain. I do it to this day. I think it's a work of genius, this book. And it really got me in shape, because he broke it down to, here's what we're going to do in minute one. Here's what you're going to do the minute five, minute twelve, and this is going to end in the forty five minutes, or whatever it is. And every minute i know exactly what i'm doing. And that like turned the key for me, and all of a sudden i was getting in shape. I never had to ask, what am i doing now? But what are we doing next? It was very it's like you got to treat your brain like a dog. You just got, you got ait's so stupid the brain. The mind is finite in wisdom. The brain is a stupid little dog that is easily trained.
  Speaker 2
  Ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha onot confuse the mind with the brain.
  Speaker 1
  The brain is so easy to master. You just have to confine it. You confine it. And it's done through repetition and systemization.
  Speaker 2
  Lets talk about febac in the experimental loop that you mentioned earlier, which was desk stage, desk stage, desk stage one for feed back would be audience feed back. And i'm curious what other forms of feed back you have.
  Speaker 1
  Oh, there is no other feed back that means anything. O k cad, well, here'sa, here's a little fine point of writing technique that i'll pass along to your writers. Hnever talk to any one about what you wrote that day. That day you have to wait twenty four hours to ever say anything to anyone about what you did, because you never want to take away that wonderful, happy feeling that you did, that very Difficult thing that you tried to do that. You accomplished it. You wrote. You sat down and wrote. So if you say anything, it's like the same reason i ever heard the thing like, you never tell people the name you're going to give the baby, sure, until it's born, because they're going To react. And the reaction is going to have a color. And if you've decided that that's to be the baby's name, you don't want to know what anybody else thinks. So i will always wait twenty four hours before i say anything to anyone about what i wrote. So you want to preserve that good feeling. Cause if you let's set, you write something and you love it, and then later on that day, you're talking to someone and you thohad, what you think of this idea? A bla, bla, blas, and they don't love it, now that day feels like a i guess you know that that was a wasted effort. So you always want to reward yourself. The key to writing, to being a good writer, is to treat yourself like a baby, very extremely nurturing and loving. And then switch over to lo gossit an officer and a gentlemanand just be a harsh, prick ball busting son of bitch about that is just not good enough. That's got to come out, or it's got to be redone or thrown away. So flipping back and forth between those two brain quadrants is the key to writing. When you're writing, you want to treat your brain like a toddler. It's just all nurturing and loving and supportiveness. And then when you look at it the next day, you want to be just a hard ass. And you switch back and forth. ([Time 0:35:26](https://share.snipd.com/snip/519992ae-4e24-4b35-b773-5df59f90064f))
