  Jared Kushner
  People generally either come with preconceived notions to different situations. Perhaps it's ego. But I find that if you're trying to do a transaction with somebody, it's not about trying to impose what you want. It's about trying to give them what they want while also getting what you want. And the type of transactions I always tried to do were not ones where I slice up a piece of pie. It was, how do you make the pie bigger? The good news is, I mean, you go on a plane and you fly out, there's a million buildings. You look down below, somebody's always getting divorced, somebody's getting old, somebody's mismanaged. So there's a million things to buy. And over time, I really developed the discipline to know that you have to just walk away from the deals that don't make sense. And if you don't have the right chemistry with a seller, or you don't think you can make the returns, it's a lot of work to convert a building. It's a lot of work to manage a building. So you want to make sure you're making the fair deal to keep the upside for yourself and your investors, not giving it all away by overpaying to somebody you're never going to see again. So that was really a lot of the framework for the approach. But just if you listen to people, they'll tell you what they want. And I saw this in government as well, because in government, most of the people I dealt with had never really negotiated before. If you think about people who are technically experienced in government, they're experienced because they're more like historians or subject matter experts. So a lot of them might say, well, what have you ever negotiated for? Do you own your house? Do you have a mortgage? And I was really shocked in government at the lack of sophistication that most people had in negotiating, which is unfortunate because the stakes in government cannot be higher. They're way higher than a little bit of money that changes hands in a real estate transaction or a corporate deal. I think people would be much more theatrical in their negotiations where they would either see it in movies or read in books how to negotiate without realizing that it's just a human To human effort where you just have to sit together as people and try to figure out how to solve problems. And a lot of the relationships I made from the deals I made in government or even in New York, most people will tell you that I was very fair to deal with. I was very honorable. I never tried to negotiate me against you. I would always say, let's sit on the same side of the table. Let's identify what our common objectives are, and then let's work together to find solutions to accomplish those objectives. And at the end of the day, even when you go back to New York real estate, the price is 100 that somebody wants. They can get that price from four or five different people. I always tried to be the one who they felt the best about and who built a reputation as when I say I'm going to do something, I do it. And somebody who's not going to play games, not going to jerk them around and who's going to deliver. And that reputation helped me out a lot as I started growing more and more in the industry.

  Our mutual friend, David Senra, is fond of saying that relationships run the world. And I was interested in your book that there's this little butterfly flapping its wings moment when Rick Gerson made an introduction to you that maybe ultimately led to the Abraham Accords, if you think about the butterfly flapping its wings. And I was really struck by that story in your book, which is the same story basically you just told, that when you first went to the Middle East with really no foreign policy experience, You weren't a historian of the Middle East necessarily, that you went and listened in maybe a unique way that they said was unique. Can you just tell that story to really drive home the power and the point of just going in with this orientation, even if you're not a huge subject matter expertise when you start? First of all, Rick is a special friend, really a special human being.
  Jared Kushner
  And I think he's very genuine through and through, and that's why he's built so much trust. And I find that one of the things that makes me very rich in life is the fact that I'm blessed to have great friends like Rick and others who I really respect in every regard and who I value. That story was one when I went to UAE, and this was on one of my first trips overseas. I sat with MBZ, who's now the president of UAE. At the time, he was the crown prince, but he was the de facto ruler of the country. And I spent the first hour basically asking him his very simple questions. So the goal during that meeting was to really bounce off of him my early framework for how I was going to approach the Palestinian issue and some of the broader regional issues with Iran And different challenges that we had. If you remember at the time in the Middle East, it was a total mess. So Syria was in a civil war where 500,000 people had been killed. Assad was using chemical weapons on the opposition. Libya was destabilized. Yemen was destabilized. Iran had just done the deal with Obama where they now were flush with cash and on a glide path to a nuclear weapon. And ISIS was roaming around and had a caliphate the size of Ohio, where they were governing over 8 million people pretty ruthlessly. So it was a mess, and a lot of the US allies felt betrayed by the deal that Obama had done with Iran. So it was probably about as bad a situation as we've seen in a long time. When I was sitting with MBZ, I basically was asking him one simple question, which was, America has a lot of power. We have a lot of tools at our disposal. You are somebody who's been here for a long time. You're thought to be one of the wisest leaders in the region and in the world. If you were me, what would you do? And I could tell he was just like not getting the question. It took us several iterations till he finally started giving me answers. And it was a great discussion where I started sharing with him some of the initial thoughts that I had and then pulling thoughts out of him and getting his responses to help me shape some Of the different approaches I was thinking of taking. He said to me at the end of the conversation, it was like a two and a half hour meeting. He said, Jared, I think you're going to make peace in this region. And I said, well, why do you say that? And he says, well, the U.S. Usually sends one of three different people to come see me. The first are people who come and they fall asleep in the meetings. The second type of person they send is somebody who comes and they read off note cards and transmit messages, but have no authority or ability to actually engage and have a conversation. And the third are the senior people who they send, who usually come to try to convince me to do things that aren't in my interest. They said, you're the first senior person that's come from the US that I can remember who actually asked questions. And at the time, I was shocked by that statement, a little dismayed, but that was kind of the only way that I knew how to do it. And it wasn't because necessarily that was my approach. It was because I came with no subject matter expertise in the Middle East. I came with no experience in diplomacy. And so I did what I thought I should do, which is find the smartest people who have vested interests in the situation and start asking them their perspectives on what they think ...

  Jared Kushner
  I saw on the campaign trail in 2016, actually 2015, I went with my father-in and started seeing what he was seeing in the country. And I was very inspired by it. I felt the country really wanted change. And I worked with him very closely on that campaign and then was very inspired by him to go work in Washington and go work on some very, very hard problems. And so being a businessman and going to Washington, I was able to see that if you bring a business perspective to global issues, you can create outcomes that people didn't think were Possible necessarily. And when I left government, I had spent my time understanding the world. I was exposed to all these global trends, the way that business was done in different places. And I'd taken a regional company when I was in business and I'd taken it national in the country. But then I thought that taking the perspectives of somebody who'd done business and then who understood geopolitics and global trends, taking that into the business world would be A very interesting adventure. Taking those learnings from my previous business and political experience into the global business world could create a very unique firm. So I set out to do something that I didn't think had been done before, where I was combining different expertise, both traditional business and investing expertise, along with geopolitical And navigation expertise. And at the core of it was really our ability to do complex problem solving and understand global trends. And that was really the foundation of what I was trying to do. And so I wanted to build a firm that kind of aligned with the values of who I felt I was and what was interesting to me. So some of them are number one, always be curious, learn about the different things in the world and try to learn about things from a very base perspective. I saw in my time in the White House that there's a lot of information asymmetry. I was in the most covered building in the world, yet most of what they wrote was not accurate about us. So I felt like that should probably be the same in the business press. So if you go out and you meet with people and you understand what they're working on, you could find some opportunities that are underappreciated. So stay curious, be very empirical in what you look for. So look for areas where you see things that the conventional thinking is different. Work to build trust. I think trust was a critical element of the success I had in my previous two careers, both in my real estate business and in my government. And so if you become somebody who's trusted by CEOs, companies, they're willing to share with you what their dreams are and what their challenges are. And if you can be somebody who's going to brainstorm with them and it's not going to leak to the press and you can come up with ideas and solutions and even connections for them that could Help them achieve those objectives, that can make you a very compelling partner. Being collaborative, working with other firms. Most of the deals we've done have been with other firms where I try to say with affinity that we're competitive to no one, but collaborative with everyone and complementary. So we work with all the other top tier firms and we co-invest where they bring different skills that we don't have, but we bring different skills and relationships that they don't have. And one plus one hopefully equals 11, as we like to say. So we work on that. We obviously try to be givers. We try to be problem solvers. And we try to be collaborators. And I think those are the different elements that I brought to the firm as a base way. And so we started exploring the world. It was in 2021. But when I started, the world's a little bit different than what I expected. And it took us a while to get started. That turned out to be a great thing. And I think one of the things that our investors really liked was the fact that we were so patient with the way that we approached our investing. Initially, we were doing mostly preferred equity deals. That was a time where people were paying crazy prices in 2021. I had a lot of my friends who'd made billions of dollars sending me transactions to co-invest with them in. And they were explaining to me, Jared, this one's at 15 times revenue instead of 20 times revenue. And I was saying, what the hell is a revenue multiple? And I didn't think they were necessarily wrong. I just thought that maybe I was not up to speed on how modern investing was done. But it turned out that that corrected pretty quickly. Then as that happened, we started seeing that the market shifted very quickly where everyone was very focused on not investing in anything that was losing money, that was cashflow Negative. But then we found some amazing companies that were technically cashflow negative, but were growing tremendously. And we thought that with our investments, we could help them turn into profitable companies. And those were some of our best investments that we've made in that sphere. And then I think what we've come to, and it fits with our original thesis, is that we basically are looking for global platforms, global problem solvers, and looking for companies that We think can make a big difference over the long term and that we can be long-term investors. And I do think there's an amazing role for the private sector to play in bringing prosperity and progress in the world. So I saw this from my time in government that governments can set policy, but policy alone can't bring prosperity or progress. You need the private sector to come in and to figure out how to create the jobs, create the companies and execute the different businesses that need to be done in order to lift society. So that was really the foundational thinking that I had at the time. And we put together a very unique team and we've done some very unique investments and it's been intellectually very stimulating. I've met a tremendous amount of new people, which has been great. And I'm very, very proud of what we've been able to do so far.
  Patrick O’Shaughnessy
  You told me this great line one time, which is that there are something like 10,000 publicly traded equities, companies. They're all pretty efficiently run. They're all sort of unified by this profit motive as the North Star. And then there are 250 some odd countries. They're all pretty inefficiently run. And the North Stars are all very different. The interests are different. It's not necessarily a profit multiple. And that therein lies an interesting opportunity to sort of understand the latter and then work with the former to find and build unique investment opportunities, which certainly Is unique relative to most investors I talk to. Maybe an example would bring the concept to life. I know you've been working on a big investment in Mexico for a long time. I'm curious for you to explain that one just as a case study of why this blend between like sovereign nations, businesses, people going global, and your unique experience might all Come together for like an investment that other people wouldn't make or wouldn't be able to make.
