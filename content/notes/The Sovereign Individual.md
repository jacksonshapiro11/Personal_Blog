    - **Note:** In the future we will have a choice over where we live. Success is a choice we must choose the learn every day and think critically about the world. Extreme agency. All things in life are a result of choices you make and the future is shaped by you. Happiness success love you choose no one picks for you.
- Move from broadcasting to narrowcasting move toward individualism
- Skill distribution will become more extreme where average intelligence and skills aren’t selected for and the higher up the curve get more rewards while the middle class average gets less due to concentration of talent inclusive of straight intelligence and other vital factors that influence outcomes. Poor countries struggled because of poor government and laws nor a mask or intelligence government the enemy of growth because they take and redistribute to lower skilled worse capital allocators or just steals it which hurts growth ambitions poor stand the most to benefit. Business is project driven and rewards or outcomes are directly aligned to ones contribution. Jobs will be tasks you do not something you have. Transfer from importance of memory to importance of synthesis value in trusting others or high trust high character digital reputations

    - **Note:** Synthesis over processing. Concentration of rewards to most skilled. Tech rewards power law. People will create smaller groups. We are evolving work and the winners from it. Do not be average in anything be very good or very bad being average is a death sentence
      Synthesis over process jobs as tasks power law outcomes.
- Money into the hands of fewer not the many fiat reduction of value and higher interest rates run by sovereign individuals reduce protection costs paid to control violence
    - **Note:** Concentration of wealth
- We’re trending from factories to work from home easy low skilled jobs to high skilled jobs there is a falling return to violence striking means you can’t shut things down there is no benefit to doing that power going from low skilled to sovereign people skilled labor have a huge advantage over unskilled labor the best football player vs an average football player governments will be forced to give people what they want because otherwise they could just move away and not pay taxes people get to choose law’s government as a service. Cyber individuals government prices will drop for protection as services become commoditized

- States became large because they were most effective but not efficient but were moving toward efficiency as tech decentralizeses power governments can be run by 3 alternative groups by proprietorships ie king tax as much as possible run a surplus keep people happy with they don’t revolt by employees incentives to raise their wages as people who run the state run deficits breed greed when government is run by customer’s governments are lean and unobtrusive currently the costs of democracy run by employees not customers the state took more from people for the same services democracy is comparable increasing returns of violence which helped democracy thrive mass democracy was the most militarily potent. As the nation state falls with falling incomes people under threat resort to nationalism as the last bastion of hope for low skilled labor. Labor and capital as divided as ever falling returns to violence will hurt nation states as large organizations

    - **Note:** Government run by employees not customers is the key model. Autocracy/employees/ customers can run a government and customers is the best because they are directly aligned. Incentive alignment. Run by customers. Labor and capital diverging further and a more decentralized less legible world. People with resort to nationalism to hold onto what is left, but eventually this will give way and the nation state will fall.
      Where this may have been wrong is a unique type of nationalism among white collar workers that is pseudo nationalistic and has played out as their jobs have been threatened. Free college and rise of benefits of doing things with your hands > white collar debt and work
- State doesn’t provide value and given an alternative people will leave because state extracts and better money spent elsewhere this will lead to a rise in violence

    - **Note:** state has a monopoly on violence but doesn't create enough value so people will leave and this will create a rise in violence. This is contradictory in many ways because its say the state does nothing but then saying the one things it does will be out of control without it. State controls violence. Bad incentive alignment leads to system destruction
- Moral outrage against political figures leads to change new technology old paradigm doesn’t work or is corrupt and a new or better system is founded that is generally hated by those not in it
    - **Tags:** #paradigm-shift, #system-destruction
    - **Note:** System change due to technology in politics
- We cannot see change in the moment convention rejects that change is happening and will deny it until it is done so you need to figure it out for yourself. Forecasts need to take into account the incentive structures created in the new system a shift in the megapoltical sources of power usually happens before the actual implementation and use of power this usually happens when income inequality is going up seeing outside the current system is taboo transitions aren’t recognized until they’re done involve a cultural revolt and a clash of values transitions are never welcome usually push back usually violence after a transition and curropption is usually a feature of late stages and the change is rapid mega politics governs people’s ability to exercise power over others

    - **Note:** The anatomy of change. We only see change clearly when it’s too late but when the change is really occurring and being shaped we don’t fully realize. There is a natural and sometimes violent resistance to change. Forecasts should be made at a system not point level because in future system changes incentive structures feedback loops change and you need to recognize that when making your prediction.
      Change is small Steady progress 3% gdp growth over 100 years caused the US to 8x gdp.
      change is cemented before we realize it's happening and to understand we need to evolve our thinking to the future incentive structures. Make predictions at a systems level.
- Moving from Industrial Age of politics to decentralized Information Age powering people to build and create ideas will become wealth see the world from the outside in empowering your skills as an individual more localized violence less tied to nation states hidden causes of change through mega politics in hidden factors that alter where power is exercised the capacity to utilize and defend against violence control of violence is valuable human nature is cyclical and changes are non linear

    - **Note:** Human nature is unchanging and cyclical.
      Information Age will provide a boost for the individual skill but may lead to more violence as the nation state recedes.
- The future is disorder crypto to decentralized libertarian values while ai is a centralizing force
