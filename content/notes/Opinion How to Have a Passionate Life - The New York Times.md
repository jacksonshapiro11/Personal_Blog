### Highlights

- When you see people ensconced in their craft, you’ll notice that they are often living what I’ve come to think of as a Zone 2 life, after the exercise trend. They are not manic; they are persistent. They’re not burning out with frantic energy, but they are just plowing their furrow, a little bit farther, day after day.
  They live with an offensive spirit. They are drawn by some positive attraction, not driven by a fear of failure. They perceive obstacles as challenges, not threats. On their good days, they’ve assigned themselves the right level of difficulty. Happiness is usually not getting what you want or living with ease; it is living, from one hour to the next, at a level of just manageable difficulty.
  By the time you’ve reached craftsman status you don’t just love the product, you love the process, the tiny disciplines, the long hours, the remorseless work. You may want to be a rock star, but if you don’t love the arduous process of making music and touring, you won’t succeed. The craftsman has internalized knowledge of the field so she can work by intuition, using her repertoire of moves, relying on hunches, not rules ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jr642gwvwdf54q348jcsz5zy))
    - **Note:** The relaxed life not too slow not too fast.
- When you’re committed to some big project, your relationship to pain changes. Murakami has clearly learned to take pride and satisfaction in his ability to withstand pain. “Pain is inevitable,” he wrote. “Suffering is optional. Say you’re running and you start to think. *Man this hurts, I can’t take it anymore.* The *hurt* part is an unavoidable reality, but whether or not you can stand any more is up to the runner himself. This pretty much sums up the most important aspect of marathon running.” As Victor Frankl noted decades ago, people can derive meaning from their ability to withstand necessary suffering.
  A 2012 University of Heidelberg study found that athletes and nonathletes have the same pain threshold, the point at which they feel pain, but that athletes have a higher pain tolerance, the amount of pain they are capable of bearing. And that tolerance comes from having continually overcome themselves in the process of training — experiencing the pain, confronting limitations and pushing through. Murakami reports that he’s not that energized by beating other people in races, just in competing against himself.
  Nietzsche famously wrote that he who has a why to live for can endure any how. If you are gripped by a profound desire, you can endure the setbacks but proceed with determination. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jr646tyfawbpbc2qc324z729))
    - **Note:** pain and suffering pain can be trained and learned like an athlete
- Self-control is often the art of using a bigger desire to conquer a smaller desire. Once you commit to some vast possibility — loving your child, country or God — some of the lesser distractions and preferences (avoid pain at all costs) seem less compelling.
  Murakami argues that the three most important traits in any writer are talent, focus and endurance. Maybe that’s the right order in inspiration-laden fields like novel writing or composing symphonies, but in most of our vocations, endurance, or stamina, matters most.

    - **Note:** self control is how we accomplish things endurance over pain
- The self-esteem movement failed because it tried to persuade people that they were great by flattering them and offering words of affirmation. People are not idiots; we need to see ourselves actually accomplishing real things, learning real things, living up to real standards. At the end of his memoir Murakami wrote that on his gravestone he’d like to be identified as a writer and runner, and then he’d like it to say: “At Least He Never Walked.”
  So, sure, on a shallow level we lead our lives on the axis of pleasure and pain. But at the deeper level, we live on the axis between intensity and drift. Evolution or God or both have instilled in us a primal urge to explore, build and improve. But life is at its highest when passion takes us far beyond what evolution requires, when we’re committed to something beyond any utilitarian logic.
  We want to be in love — with callings, projects and people. The opposite of love is not hate, it’s indifference, and indifference is an absolutely terrible state to endure. I guess there are some people who have earned the right to want contentment above all, to sit back and enjoy whatever prosperity they’ve achieved. But I rarely meet such people, even people in retirement. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jr64h4ks5y6tf5vvzgjkxmfv))
    - **Note:** We get pleasure from doing hard things not the easy life
