### Highlights

- Episode AI notes
  1. Executing ideas well and taking risks is crucial for success in the restaurant industry. Copying a concept without proper execution can result in a subpar experience. Understanding the core of why something is special is important. Innovative techniques like ticketing and dynamic pricing can lead to success.
  2. Restaurants provide entertainment and art, not just food. Selling tickets for restaurant reservations can be a successful approach. Overcoming skepticism and resistance from industry peers is necessary for proving new concepts.
  3. Deciding which features to prioritize in a software company can be challenging. Competitors often imitate existing solutions without innovating. Attracting price-sensitive customers may lead to undesirable outcomes.
  4. Creating a strong network and providing ROI are crucial for a payment processing company. Building a network in smaller cities is as essential as in major cities. Choosing the right first customers plays a significant role in shaping a business.
  5. Restaurants should focus on improving sales efficiency to increase profit margins and reduce waste. Small changes in revenue strategies can have significant financial gains. Understanding the difference between peak and off-peak times is crucial for success. ([Time 0:00:00](https://share.snipd.com/episode-takeaways/3ecab7b0-6e8d-4fea-b33a-1c129de21ae9))

  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Could use a different substance. And we were looking for gray latex. He found it at a sex shop in Paris. Rolls of gray latex. I'm the internet. Like he wasn't trolling about the sex shops in Paris. We figured out we called them like we manufacturers this for you and they're like what are you into?
  Speaker 4
  And we're like, where are you in for food? Table food art. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
  Speaker 1
  That's the story of how that came to be. But I think that encapsulates a lot of our thinking. That was a six or seven month project. And then we figured out how to do it once. We would do one table a night and we would go there's no way we could do this for every table. And then four weeks later we were doing it 30 times a night. It's a magical thing like Netflix, Jeff's table had that on billboards in Los Angeles promoting the show. So for me it's a really weird thing because it came out of this process of three or four or five people talking about how do I make you feel like a kid again. And clearly it stuck out in your mind as a new weird fun experience, which is really what we're shooting for.
  Speaker 2
  Just to pour evidence on the pile. I still tell people about that all the time. And it's interesting to me how often businesses seem to want to go down the fairway and sort of not be risky and how incredibly boring but also how bad a business decision that is. Because if it was just a lava cake or something like I wouldn't talk about it.
  Speaker 1
  There's an important distinction here and that is this. People have copied that now. Anything good gets copied. And if you Google up restaurants in South America and Asia that are copying it, they don't copy it well. They'll literally just take a bunch of food and dump it on a table. No, no, no. If you're going to try to do this very risky kind of potentially polarizing thing, you have to make it elegant and beautiful too. Execution. The ideas are great. I tell people all the time, you can have all the great ideas in the world. If you do not execute them at a high level, it's going to fall flat. Grant, when we first opened, wanted to show movement and food, he had this little bacon on a wire thing and stuff. And now there's a bunch of steak houses that put thick steakhouse bacon on a clothespin. Our thing may have been done and we only did it for four months, but they didn't really get the point of it. It looked beautiful at least. And now they've got clothespins holding bacon on a wire. You have to figure out the core of why it's special. And that's a tricky thing to do a lot of times.
  Speaker 2
  Going back to the kind of way the business itself is run and the service delivered, you guys have been extremely innovative in things like ticketing, selling meals ahead of time, not At the restaurant, things like dynamic pricing. Can you talk through how you arrived maybe at those two concepts at first and the impact that they had on the business once they were in place? ([Time 0:21:44](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ae6ac9b1-5b31-43ec-9edd-1b423c037b97))
    - **Note:** Viewing things from ground zero and trying to innovate. They wanted to make people feel like kids so they wanted to make a big plate 6 months later ended up buying latex from a sex shop in paris to execute the idea. Ran the restaurant strictly like a business but still created a 3 Michellen star best restaurant in the world. How do you take something ordinary make it special and step out of the box.
- The Entertainment and Social Nature of Restaurants
  Key takeaways:
  - Restaurants can lose significant revenue due to no-shows and inaccurate reservations
  - Multiplying the cost of small daily losses can reveal their impact over time
  - Restaurants are not just about food, but also provide entertainment and art
  - Selling tickets for restaurant reservations can be a successful approach
  - The speaker faced skepticism and resistance from industry peers before proving the concept's success

  Speaker 1
  And it's like, no, actually they lied to me and told me they had an eight o'clock table, and they knew that they didn't have one until nine o'clock. And why would they do that? Well, because if they told me nine o'clock, I would have gone to the restaurant down the street that lied to me and told me eight o'clock. And then conversely, a lot of people lied to the restaurant. They would call a linea back then, and they would say like, hey, we want a table for six on March 23rd. Say, I'm really sorry, I'll be having a table for four. They would say, okay, I'll take it. And then they'd show up with six people. Or worse, they want a table for two, and they say, I'm sorry, we only have a table for six. Okay, we'll take it. We'll just bring four friends. They show up as two. All of a sudden, you have two people sitting at six top, and you've just forgotten $1,000 revenue. Now, you multiply that out over the course of the year, and we were losing over a million dollars of revenue through those two things happening. One of the basic things that people don't do in the restaurant industry, and it drives me nuts, even with our own staff, is no one multiplies it out by some days a week, 52 weeks a year. So if you have something that's costing you even $20 a day, add it up. It's a low margin business because you're not looking at these chunks of revenue. I was just going, why in the world, if we have a wait list of 200 people, can we not just limit it to the people who actually are willing to come in and take a little bit of a deposit first? And what's fascinating about that is that when I said that to people, I was like, look, baseball games, concerts, theater, every other form of entertainment does some sort of take it in. And I was told that it was a terrible idea because restaurants are not entertainment. And I was like, what are they? What's really fascinating about restaurants and food in general is that because we are biological creatures that need to eat, people have all sorts of emotional and cultural and ethical baggage on top of what a restaurant is. And you're seeing that now during the pandemic. And at the heart, though, you don't need to eat out. Eating out is a social endeavor. It's entertainment. It might be art. And it definitely assessments as well. At the core of it, we could charge ahead. I was told by everybody I talked to that it was a terrible idea. Literally everybody except for my wife. Grant thought it was a terrible idea or general manager at the time. That was a terrible idea. Notice I say at the time, it was very, very, very frustrating because I kept having this notion in my head rod wake up every day going, we really should just take a $50 deposit and then the problem to solve. I honestly knew nothing about behavioral economics at the time. I didn't know these were things that were tested. I just knew that as a derivatives trader, if everything went to zero at the end of a day, that's like an expiring option. And that option value changes the closer you get the expiration. And yet we kept all of our values constant. In other parts of the world, that wasn't the case. I sat down one day in 2014 and wrote this long essay. But before then, I skipped the head. When we were building next, I just decided this is like a theater-like restaurant. It changes three times a year to an entirely new menu. I'm going to sell tickets to this. And again, everyone in my own company thought I was an idiot. So I had to hire an outside programmer, had to not get a phone on purpose. We barely built it in time, and it broke right away because it was a home brew software. But then the first day, we sold $562,000 in tickets to a restaurant for the first time ever. And I remember that as one of the happiest days of my life. Because I turned on this thing, and people did it five or six or seven years of me kind of looking at this going like, I'm pretty sure this will work. I'm pretty sure this will work. And everybody in the industry telling me, no, and all my employees rolling their eyes at me. I remember I called Grant up and we were opening night for next. And I said, you've got to come to my house. And he was like, dude, we're opening a restaurant tonight. I can't. Things are falling apart here. And I was like, just come, just for 10 minutes. And he showed up literally in his chef, whites and clogs. And I must have looked like hell because I had spent like 10 straight days like a bad movie eating pizza and drinking wine and trying to get this thing set up. So I hadn't shaved that in a shower. I looked like the big obeliski. I took him up to my little third floor office, and I showed him, I'm like, click on that button that table become available. And then it will instantly sell. And he did it. And he's like, what happened? And I was like, we just got $625 in our bank account. And that person's not going to die for two months. And anyone that you open will instantaneously sell. And he was like, that's amazing. And I was like, yeah, it's fucking amazing. ([Time 0:25:44](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5c2243ba-fe0c-4e58-8618-98ffc669b71f))
    - **Note:** They came up with the idea of charging ahead for reservations. $20 lost a night * 365 is tens of thousands and they optimized this reservation lying on both sides by putting capital at stake. Sold tickets for the restaurant for $500k in one day the demand was so high and they generated float for the business. They made 30% margins while providing a cheaper dining experience because of the predictability ticketing for time slotted businesses with dynamic pricing. All service businesses from trainers to dry cleaners would benefit from dynamic pricing.
- The early days of starting a software company and the challenges of deciding which features to focus on
  Key takeaways:
  - The speaker encountered a big problem while trying to solve and build a restaurant waitlist system due to its complexity and lack of existing solutions.
  - Building an app for a waitlist feature proved to be a successful venture, as demonstrated by a company selling their app to Yelp for $40 million.
  - The speaker observed that many leaders in the industry did not fully understand the problem and dismissed it during conferences.
  - The speaker shared their thoughts on the problem in a blog post, which gained significant attention from economists and restaurant owners.
  - The speaker realized that the enthusiastic response they received from restaurant owners did not represent the majority, highlighting the challenge of crossing the chasm from early adopters to mainstream adoption.
  - The speaker partnered with Brian Fitzpatrick, who quit Google to join the venture, and hired a team of engineers to build out the company.
  - The earliest days of the company involved starting with a small team in a spare storeroom and focusing on selling the product to the industry.
  - The speaker assessed the competition and found that most companies were copying OpenTable's features and giving their product away for free, which attracted price-sensitive customers who were not necessarily thriving.

  Speaker 1
  And it ended up being a much bigger problem than I thought in terms of solving it, programming it, building out the system because there's just so many components to it. And that's why no one had started it before. There are whole companies built around a wait list for a restaurant. And that's a feature, not an application. But they turned it into an app and they just built a little better wait list thing and they sold the Yelp for like 40 million bucks. So I would look at this and go, how is that a thing? That's a weekend project and it's not even executed well. More power to them, mind you. But I would just get incredibly frustrated that there are these little peaks and pokes at it. So finally, I woke up literally one day and read this article in the Wall Street Journal about reserve and resi and open table and just went, no one gets it. No one gets what the real problem is here. I would listen to some leaders in the industry.
  Speaker 3
  Wow, they don't get it either.
  Speaker 1
  Meanwhile, I knew what the finances of my own restaurants look like. This doesn't seem as hard of a problem as they're saying. When I would go into conferences and talk to them, it was incredibly dismissed. I wrote this blog post literally on Saturday morning, woke up read the article and said, I should probably dump all my thoughts into a blog post. 5,000 words in like four hours and posted it up. It was read a couple million times in the first couple months because economists loved it because they were like, oh, this is behavioral economics and action. Restaurant owners that were like, yes, this is what I've been thinking. Now, if 200 restaurant owners email you, you fall into the trap like every startup going like, well, everybody thinks this is what.
  Speaker 3
  Look, people love this idea.
  Speaker 1
  But of course, the 200 restaurants that email, you are the ones that are the minority. I didn't know that at the time. The crossing the chasm thing is kind of real. So the early adopters are all going to call you up and say that you're brilliant. We want the software and all that. Well, I've felt for that and called Brian Fitzpatrick and said, look, I need to make this into a company. And he was the head of Google in Chicago at the time. I was like, I need to hire two engineers and build this thing out. I was seriously under imagining what it would take. That naivete is great to have when you're starting a company. I had invested in other software companies. I grew up programming as a kid now that I can program it all now. But I knew what was sort of required. And he quit Google. I didn't expect him to, but he just said, I want to quit and start this with you. And we hired a few really great engineers who had heard me, one of whom heard me give a talk at Google actually about dynamic and variable pricing for time-slide businesses. And it was a talk about derivatives and how derivatives can apply to things other than financial products. These folks are super geeky engineers and understood the math and statistics of these things and what not and were enamored of trying to apply that to an industry that's 5% of GDP. So we started out with a group of five people, literally in a closet. We had like a spare storeroom in the Elinia offices. That's how it started. It's been fascinating to actually sell this thing to the industry.
  Speaker 2
  Can you talk about what it was like in the earliest days and how you decided which restaurants customers to focus on and which features to deliver to them first? I always find this to be a huge challenge in building software is you kind of know where you're going in the end state, but the sequencing is really critical to success or failure and hard to stay disciplined on. So how did that go in the early days of talk? Who did you focus on and what did you deliver first and what was your strategy for deciding those two things?
  Speaker 1
  I looked at what everyone else was doing and what everyone else was doing, our competitors worldwide, I looked at every booking system worldwide and what they all did was that they copied part or as much as they could of the feature set of OpenTable and then gave the product away for free to gather market share. That is a standard playbook kind of thing to do, which is, hey, we'll make the slightly better iterative mouse trap and then underpriced the competition. We tout a new feature or two, but really it's we're not trying to break new ground here because we don't want to scare people. That is exactly what was getting funded at the time. And I looked at the products and I was like, this doesn't do anything for me that I couldn't do on OpenTable and yet might be free. But if you give something away from free, the people that you attract are the people who need free. So in a weird way, you get the worst customers. If people are that price sensitive, they're probably not thriving. ([Time 0:35:19](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e63a87d4-3768-403b-b38b-610b159a4d27))
    - **Note:** Wanted to build an app where the restaurant owners not the reservation providers like open table owned the data and customer experience. Building a software business. Make better mouse trap and undercut the competition but when you sell something as free you get customers that need free adverse selection of customers. Spent a very clear customer in the first 6 months attack a specific markets.
- Creating a Resilient Network and Providing ROI for Restaurants
  Key takeaways:
  - We will make our money by processing millions of dollars from POS systems
  - Some VCs believed in our business model once we had a significant number of restaurants on board
  - Origin Ventures showed faith in our long-term project and offered a term sheet with a high valuation
  - Creating a network in smaller cities is as essential and resilient as in major cities
  - We focused on providing a great ROI to different types of restaurants and expanded rapidly
  - Our engineers gained empathy for end users by working in restaurants
  - Instead of conducting focus groups, we brought restaurants into our offices
  - Choosing the right first customers plays a significant role in shaping a business
  - We turned down potential customers who were not the right fit for us three years ago
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And by the way, we'll process millions of dollars. We'll pull that from the POS systems. We'll be a payment processing company at the core. That's how we will make our money in the long run. And I'm telling you, nobody believed it in the VC world. Not nobody believed it, because I had some really great VCs that very quickly believed it once we had 50 to 80 to 100 restaurants on. Origin Ventures, Jason Helzer, I served as a judge at the new venture challenge at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, sat next to him a couple times on that and I was like, oh, this guy gets it. He asked the tough questions here and all that. He always said to me, like, if you're ever going to take money for talk, let me know. While we never intended to, I recognized about a year into it that this is going to be a long-term project, tenure project, it's going to take hundreds of people to build it, and that doesn't. I went out to raise money. I called him up. He came in. They talked for an hour. We had a term sheet at a crazy valuation an hour later. And that was because for years, he saw how I personally operated, and he knew that I was committed to doing it well. But the business model didn't resonate with most people until honestly this year. People now see that creating a network in, say, New York, in Los Angeles and San Francisco is not as resilient as creating a network in Kansas City, Minneapolis, and those cities as well. You need everywhere, and you need all sorts of different restaurants, and you need to figure out how to provide the ROI to all strata of these businesses. As soon as we had all the features that could provide a great ROI for really high-end restaurants, we started going hard down market, fast on purpose, and building out all those features and breaking them. And then all of our engineers went and worked in restaurants as hosts. These are people who spent their time staring at a computer screen or suddenly checking people in at a restaurant. So they certainly had empathy for the end user. And we didn't conduct focus groups. We bring the restaurants into our offices. We did the opposite. We took our people and we put them into the restaurant.
  Speaker 2
  Two incredible insights, the one being that last one there, putting people in there, but also the value of spending care and time choosing your first customers. It's so interesting how much of a business gets determined by who it picks as its first customers. I feel like that doesn't get talked about enough.
  Speaker 1
  And who you don't pick too. There were restaurants and restaurant groups that wanted to use us three years ago when I saw what they needed and what they wanted to do. I just went, we're not quite ready for you yet. And they were like ready to sign on. ([Time 0:41:24](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3ded8133-89b6-4293-8a72-0d0f3569a60c))
    - **Note:** Building a network then going down market and putting engineers in restaurants so they could gain empathy. Most vc didn’t get the concept but he cultivated relationships with a vc who understood his idea and this helped him secure financing. Importance of choosing the right first customers as a business and who you pick and don’t pick. They didn’t get business because they knew they would fail. Instead of growth at all costs they added as many restaurants as they could and maintained capital efficiency. Got to profitablity quickly
- How to Make More Than 20% Restaurant Revenue
  Key takeaways:
  - Restaurants should focus on their revenue side and selling efficiently to improve margins.
  - Efficient operations can lead to better food costs, lower waste, and positive environmental impact.
  - Small changes in revenue strategies can unlock significant financial gains for restaurants.
  - Businesses should clearly understand and market their unique experiences to customers.
  - Different days of the week have varying levels of demand in the restaurant industry, and this should be considered in operations and marketing.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  But restaurants never concentrated on their revenue side other than going like whoever sells the most my ties this month gets a bonus to their shivers, which essentially means that you get a terrible sales pitch at the beginning. So my whole thing is we gave restaurants tools to actually sell. The other part of that is that if you sell more efficiently, your margins get better and better because the last dollars in are the dollars you keep. Your fixed costs are known, rent, utilities, all that sort of stuff. Your cost of goods sold look better and better and better when you have less waste. So it's actually good for the environment. It's good for your food costs. It's usually 30 to 35% labor, 30 to 35% food costs, 30% on your fixed costs and insurance and overhead and all that. What are you left with? 10%. Well, if you can eliminate food costs, if you can run more efficiently, if you can have high demand on a Tuesday at 9.30 at night, you will make 20 to 30% restaurant. I have dozens of restaurants I've talked to where they said it's completely impossible to make more than 20%. It's just not possible. Over and over and over again, I see that when they make these small changes, even the casual places on the revenue side suddenly it unlocks money that they just were like, wow, the denominator is the same and the numerator kept big. It's just not that hard, but no one does it. No one runs it efficiently and people are scared of changing. People are like, well, what about our customers that want to call on the telephone? What about the people? What about the great customer that doesn't want the tasting menu? And I was like, great, hold back, four tables. Click that button and hold back four tables. I'm not telling you to change the entirety of your business for every person. I'm saying run some of those experiments we talked out at the beginning and see what the outcomes are. And I've been incredibly unimpressed in general with the industry if they're willingness to do that.
  Speaker 2
  What do you think the generalizable lessons are from these learnings at talk about specifying revenue sources and exposing them to customers more deliberately, reducing uncertainty? If you were just thinking about business, generally speaking, what lessons do you think could be very broadly applied, not just to restaurants?
  Speaker 1
  Know what you're selling and then actually selling, which sounds incredibly stupid. No, I know it's so stupid. I'm telling you what, there should be a business course on that. If I ask grandma C. Tavern what you're selling, they'd say food. And I'd go, no, you're actually selling seven different experiences plus immersion days. Meanwhile, you haven't categorized those experiences until after someone comes in. You haven't even formed the consumer that they exist. Do you want to be surprised when you go to pick up your car that you bought? Would it be really weird if the car had a different color and they tried to sell you on that one? Yeah, you'd walk out of the place. One of the talks I give to all of our new employees at talk and to the industry is called Tuesday is not Saturday and seven other things you already know but are doing nothing about. It's really obvious you don't need to be an expert in the restaurant business to know every restaurant in the world probably, or 99% with some anomaly, are busier on Saturday night than Tuesday night. Okay, so we have that. You're not going to get an argument even from a diner. Yeah, more people eat out on Saturday night. ([Time 0:49:32](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1d936ca2-8c3a-4a9b-a4cb-55191b92e995))
    - **Note:** People are scared to do the work up front which slightly limits optionskoty but makes the restaurant run much more efficiently. Know what you’re selling then actually sell it. When you ask questions in an industry and the participants don’t know then someone is obfuscating it and getting very rich. It makes more sense to self publish unless you are writing a book to no audience like a text book. He started preparing food and got half off to get predictability. It was more valuable to him and the vendor to get predictability because of they don’t sell on time they can’t sell it so they need to over charge so there’s a big benefit to predicting demand. Mitigate food costs there is prepay risk but there is much less benefit to float. Ask the right questions. Created forward contracts. Knowing your customers is vital but restaurants don’t do this. Saw the tail risk of Covid and needed to get ahead of it. They also built delivery features working 20 hours a day for a week and they fired people who didn’t wash hands could be very serious when the task was serious and acted fast without debate.
