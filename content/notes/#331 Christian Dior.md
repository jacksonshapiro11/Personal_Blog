  Speaker 1
  At the last minute, Dior was frightened and almost turned down the offer, but he was persuaded into it by his fortune teller. Dior doubled the risk of opening a new fashion house with his revolutionary new look, a deliberate and defiant return to the most extravagant use of material. He spat in the face of post-war egalitarian democracy and said, I want to make the rich feel rich again. His first collection turned out to be the most successful in fashion history. Christian Dior recruited and continued to employ the best people to be found in France, men and women who would rather die than turn out a piece of clothing, which was in the tiniest degree Below the best in the world. When I first read this, the note I left myself was, this is the Pixar of fashion houses. When Steve Jobs, he said the first 400 employees at Pixar was the only company he ever came across in his entire life that was an entire company of a players. When he went back to Apple in 97, I think he said they had around 3000 employees. And he's like, of course, you can't have a collection of 3000 a players, but Pixar proved to Steve Jobs as possible to have 400 a players inside of one company. The success of the fashion house was immediate and prolonged. And the volume of business continued to grow steadily in the 10 years up to Dior's ([Time 0:08:02](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4247b857-887f-41d0-b999-f050d99c71f1))
    - **Note:** Dior grew up in Paris. His dad ran a manure business. His dad supported him to run his own art gallery in the depression it folded had he never failed he would’ve remained a middle level art dealer his entire life opportunity is a strange beast. He didn’t get his shot until he has 40. You need to increase your surface area for luck and he met a man bussack who wanted to get into the luxury business dior told him he wanted to make a fashion house and got funding for 10mm then 100mm franks. He only hired a players and had the best fashion house in the world. He was completely counter positioned to every other designer by opting for opulence and making the rich feel rich instead of austerity. His first line is still the most successful fashion line ever.

  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  He puts his the last chapter is on his his childhood, like his early lives, but reading Paul Johnson's overview of the life and career of Christian Dior inspired me to pick up his autobiography And reread it. And I'm glad I did because Christian Dior is maybe one of the most unique people. He just stands out to think about like you and I study uncommon people and even Christian Dior is uncommon amongst uncommon people because how many people do we study that had no entrepreneurial Leanings at all, that other people would describe with by the time they're in their forties that they had they were nobodies and they had nothing to suggest any kind of genius. There's a lot of people that become successful and achieve their greatest work later in life. But you'll hear from people when they were younger that they showed signs of talent or obsessiveness or drive that was unusual compared to the people around them. No one describes Christian Dior like that. He doesn't even describe himself like that. So I want to go through his autobiography and I want to see if you and I together can figure out the mystery that is Christian Dior. I have to start with something that was very fascinating because again, like I'm pretty sure you don't believe in fortune tellers just like I don't believe in fortune tellers. But the important thing is like that Dior believed in them and that sometimes it's helpful to have something outside of yourself that pushes you even though you're you're filled with With doubt. Dior was rife with insecurities and uncertainties. ([Time 0:10:24](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0b941e3c-ccd2-4d06-91f2-6c1914af97ba))
    - **Note:** Dior had nothing to suggest his later success it just happened later in life usually people show promise his came out of nowhere. He had no self confidence but believed deeply in Fourtune tellers who instilled self confidence in him through their fortunes. He was terrified of risk he saw his family fortune lost in the depression that had lasted generations. No self confidence hates risks so he invented another persona like the black mamba. Life is about inventing yourself he had no self confidence but when he was working he was this transcendent designer named Christian Dior. He didn’t want to revitalize something old he wanted to start fresh with a new fashion house. He laid out his plans for building it and Bussack said yes this three dior in a panick he knew he couldn’t build this great fashion house and tried to kill the deal but his fortune teller told him he needed to go forward with the deal and gave him the push. She told him this was his only chance and this fired him on.

  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  This conversation with the fortune teller actually convinces him, regardless of yourself doubt, how terrified you are, you must do this. She ordered me sternly to accept the Busac offer at once. You must create the house of Christian Dior, whatever the conditions. Nothing anyone will offer you later will compare with the chance, which is open to you now. I therefore resign myself to the inevitable. Listen to that advice. You must create the house of Christian Dior, whatever the conditions. Nothing anyone will offer you later will compare with the chance, which is open to you now. So once he decided to go ahead, this is when he starts to the way I think about this, he starts building at the peck, the Pixar or fashion houses. He's building a team of fanatics and Christian Dior is definitely a fanatic. And so he talks a little bit about his thinking behind this. I knew that if I were to emerge victorious, I had to be equipped with a first class staff. So he's, she's just going to go over a few of the first people they hires. So Raymond was to become my second self. She is my exact compliment. She plays reason to my fantasy order to my imagination, discipline to my freedom, foresight to my recklessness. She has supplied me with all the qualities, which I have never had time to acquire for myself. Another early hire is Burkard. Burkard is one of those people increasingly rare who make elegance. ([Time 0:19:18](https://share.snipd.com/snip/80f695d7-0b59-41d9-a528-90aa9007a24f))
    - **Note:** He built a first class team. He was a fanatic and he only hired fanatics and he was a fanstic. Dior had a deep understanding of the craft and Dior just saw himself as a craftsman nothing more or less. Wanted to be a great craftsman. Takes a lot of craftsmanship to turn a great idea into a great product. Secrecy can be better to produce publicity. He never did ads just cultivated mystery. He just wanted to make things people love and clothes and designs were his life. Believe in the power of enthusiasm he gave everything to his designs and this was his personal heaven and hell. He was always thinking and learning. Need to have humility in the face of a good idea. He had intense stress when building and was very conscientious he cares deeply about his product and his craft needed to get it right. Care as the key to craftsmanship. He would sprint and do the job until it was done then he would rest for long periods

  Speaker 1
  I nearly kill myself repeating over and over and over again that if the models go wrong, it is after all my fault and nobody else's. And the only way he deals with this intense stress and the torture that he imposes on himself, I would describe him. He's not really a grinder. He has to in certain periods when they're getting a new collection. And then once it releases, he takes a long extended vacation. So I would say that way he works is sprint, rest, sprint, rest, sprint, rest. To me, peace and quiet are a necessity of life. If I am in one sense, a very busy man, in another sense, I'm a very lazy one. The application and care, which I devote to my work are rooted in my desire to be finished with it as soon as possible. I am innately conscientious and therefore never stop until I'm all together satisfied with my work. And maybe the most important theme, like if I was going to remember one thing from his autobiography is I just love people that truly care about what they're doing. I don't care what that is. I'm not interested in designing fashion dresses for God's sake, but I am intensely interested in people like Christian Dior. The most common note I have that I leave to myself over dozens of pages in this book is he gives a fuck. He truly, truly care. You can tell by the effort, the time, the enthusiasm that he puts into this. And then I just like the way that he thinks about his work in very intense and passionate terms. I think of my work as a femoral architecture dedicated to the beauty of the female body. ([Time 0:31:26](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ebe49d86-5847-4dec-a802-e511073f77ce))
    - **Note:** He truly and deeply cared about his work above everything. Incredible obsessiveness soul in the game. Enzo Ferrari would hate to see his cars race because they would crash and break he saw these cars as his children. Dior had the same feeling when the dresses were being rehemed he couldn’t watch. Dior would always ask if he was importing enough novelty into his designs. His life revolved around his dresses when he was not making dresses he was panicking. Making dresses and entrepreneurs experience only elation and terror.
