  Speaker 1
  Like when I got benched for the concussion, like when I got traded to Kansas City, when we drafted Patrick Mahomes to view my replacement and certainly helped me when I broke my leg and Was sitting in a wheelchair for five months and they're talking about cutting it off. To go back to the beginning, it was those things that I struggled with and learned from early on in my career that really set the stage for me to ever come back and play again after my leg. I didn't realize it was as broad the just live idea.
  Speaker 3
  I knew that it was a big deal for you, but I didn't realize it was as impactful. I guess, dude, like if you go back then, so Blake comes, he's teaching you this mentality, you admire the way he's living, you're going to try and emulate it. But I feel like one of the things that I'm embarrassed to say this, but before you told me, like, I don't think I realized the highs you had in your career before the lows. Where not going to be able to do that. That. Okay, all of a sudden you embrace the just live You start to play Harbaugh comes all of a sudden your ball. What happens?
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, I'm glad you said Harbaugh He was at the exact same time This was happening the same time that Blake came on the roster and I'm learning this, Harbaugh gets hired. That wasn't a coincidence that it coincided with, I think, me, really an inflection point in my career that those happened at the same time. And Harbaugh is a guy that played 15 years. He played my position. He played quarterback. I grew up in San Diego. Harbaugh played for the San Diego Chargers. I watched him play. And then he coached at Stanford when I was here with the Niners. So it's like right down the street, I saw his success and then when we hire him. And Jim also like, he's a quirky dude. But I think one of his greatest strengths is Jim does not give a shit what anybody thinks about him. He does. You're stuck into the khakis. Yes. At the press conference with the media. He would wear these pleated khakis and tuck his sweatshirt in. He loved it. He like owned it. Wearing the glasses on purpose. Even now he still does some of these same things. Again, he's going to own this. But the way he talked to the team, all about the team, his final words, again, to go back to like right before kickoff, you're in the locker room. Again, this environment that I just stated like it is thick and tense. His final words before every single game, the last words the head coach would say to the team before they ran out and took the field, he would say play as hard as you can, as fast as you can, Or as long as you can. And don't worry. His last two words were don't worry. For me, I spent my entire career up to that point as a professional worrying. That's exactly what I did. I worried. I worried about everything. And I felt like he really connected with me. And again, he was confronting it, this idea of it's there. He knows it. He wore the pads for 15 years. He knows worry. And here he is telling us to play free. Like I try to tell my kids. And at this point, I've been a professional for six, seven, eight years at this point, and he's still saying these same things.
  Speaker 2
  Jim Harbaugh is also coming from the college ranks. So again, we can talk about the difference between a college mentality and a pro mentality. It's very subtle, but he brought that personal touch. And you're not going to find too many pro coaches on any sports saying, Hey, don't worry. Just like you're not going to find any fortune 500 CEOs saying to their executive team, Hey, don't worry. It'll all work out.
  Speaker 3
  I think this thing to me, I love the acknowledgement of it. That's cool. Like, look, we all fucking know you're going to get worried. You play once a week, you play 16 games times a year. That's cool that he embraced it. And then it's so funny. You talk about the play free, like in a completely different context. That's something I say all the time to people at work at home. The only way we're having any chance is if you play, but I also remember, like as a fan, I remember watching him with the quarterback pumping on the shoulder.
  Speaker 1
  Oh, right before, like the last thing he'd smack you around. I remember the first time he did it. Again you got all these nerves and as quarterbacks you don't hit all week. You don't get touched. You got these yellow jerseys on right like you're untouchable and here you are finally on Sundays once a week you're not. You got the ball in your hand and the sharks are coming. They're coming to get you. I remember I'm getting ready to run out. I got all this pent up anxiety and energy and excitement and him coming over and he just starts pounding on my shoulder pads and my chest smacking me in the head. It was also this physical deal that it kind of relaxed me. It helped get some of that energy at bay. And that was even kind of a physical manifestation of the same things he was talking about. Get ready to go, man. Embrace this. Yeah. And I think there was also in that moment, there was this longing. He didn't talk about it a lot, but I knew he was jonesing to strap it up one more time. And that he very much, I could tell, and he didn't talk like this. It wasn't like the old guys that would come in a lot. We would get these. You guys are so lucky to play and it's going to be over before you know it. And like, tune that out as a player, you know, like, yeah, yeah. But like, Jim, it was like, you could feel how much he wanted to one more time put the shoulder pads and helmet on and go out there. I appreciated that. That made me also think, you know what, this is going to be over for me, maybe real soon depending like on my trajectory at that point Fuck it.
  Speaker 3
  I'm gonna be present from now on that also though dudes like the actions instead of the word someone could say the fucking thing Yeah, it's gonna be over before you know it when this dudes
  Speaker 1
  Jamming on your shoulder pads trying to fucking hit you and like you can Feel it that's just like so different and this is a little side thing and Shane. I don't know if you've ever had these guys He was not a good luck coach I was with a lot of coaches that like, again, I go back to the same environment Sunday before kickoff in the locker room And they'd come around and be like, good luck. And I remember thinking like, good luck. Aren't you fucking coming out with us? We're in this together, man. Like, what are you telling me? Good luck for like call good plays. You got a job to do. Like your job's not over. There's a lot of these guys that calm. They're good luck coaches. The great coaches are definitely not that they are in it with you. Yeah, they can't run out there in between the lines, but like every bit of them's on board and fight until their last whistle to do anything they can to help the team. And Jim was not that you definitely felt his commitment on how on board he was.
  Speaker 2
  Well, Alex, talk about being there when your replacement gets drafted. It's a very strange phenomenon. It's happened a lot in the corporate world, I guess you could say. And every now and then to the board may bring in someone to the executive team that writes on the wall to replace you. And in sports, there's much more of a direct correlation. I went through that when I was in Memphis. ([Time 0:22:34](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8c733ff4-e9bc-4c5e-95be-3e2a50e91e99))
    - **Note:** Being present and not being a good luck coach being a good coach. Just live your life and be present
- Empathy and Resilience: The Power of Connection
  Summary:
  The influence of those around us can be profound, as we often underestimate the impact our actions and words have on others.
  Individuals can inspire resilience and strength in one another simply by living authentically and supporting each other through challenges. Everyone possesses the capacity to overcome adversity, but it is the presence of good people and a supporting community that enables this potential to flourish.
  Recognizing and expressing gratitude for those who uplift us, even years later, can deepen our connections and reinforce our resolve.
  It’s crucial to understand that everyone faces difficult times and that belief in oneself, coupled with encouragement from others, is key to navigating life's struggles.
  Acknowledging the experiences of service members can serve as a reminder of the courage and resilience present in all people.

  Speaker 3
  Some empathy, but it didn't work Fucking cajun or like did ever want to take you know, I guess it's I'm I'm like, I'm I'm I, he, he holds us to a high standard, but I mean, that is good, man. You got to have people in your life that you admire. Alex, man, I not just respect you and like you, I admire you, man. That is amazing. I would say, man.
  Speaker 1
  I mean, honestly, it means a lot, but like, again, I feel like on this side of it, it's so funny how to it flips like you, how lucky you feel And that's the truth. I get could have gone so many different directions. Again, how lucky like all the teammates and people along the way that when I needed it were there and not knowingly right like again, just the way they live their life affected me. And I think that's one of the cool things going forward as like, whatever team you're on are a part of from family unit to like friends circles, business, sports teams, or even just like Humanity, like the big team, like, I think it's so cool to know that you can be that for one another, you have no idea what the person next to you is going through and where they're at, they Could definitely be in one of the down, they could be going through it, just how you go about your business and live your life. What Shane talks about all the time, like, just be a good person, man, like, you know, and I I think that that can have a profound impact on people. It took a lot of years. It was like 10 years later that Blake found out the effect he had on me. And I'm actually bummed that I never told him sooner, but like, you just don't know. You don't know the effect you can have on one another.
  Speaker 3
  Well, dude, you should also, that guy is a think that's a good thing. I mean, good good thing. Thing. I think that's a Yeah. Yeah. We got to get him on the show. He's awesome. Yes. To me, there was like this theme of like, bring the football. He like showed you something was possible by thinking, Hey man, like this is possible. Like how cool is that? Gave you a thought that something you could do.
  Speaker 2
  And then your wife, that moment of not letting you off the hook. Do it. It. I'm I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it from the story is you hear stories of resilience and things that people accomplish under unimaginable traumas and adversity and like, how do you do that? And it's crazy. Like to a man, how should you, it's no big deal. This is what you have to do. And so many people in the world, I think, struggle with that belief that they don't have that in them. And I argue, like, yeah, we all do. We all do. And it gets revealed in different ways. And obviously, the people around you can help bring that out. But that's sort of why we're here, talking about these sort of things that to highlight. Yeah, we're all just blue guys, everyone listening, everyone hanging out with us for the hour. We all got it in us. And I hope that people listening can hear this story. And maybe they're going through some tough times. Everyone faces tough times at some point. You can do it. If you have good people around you and that belief that you can do it, you did it, man. That's your helping example. Helping example.
  Speaker 1
  I couldn't agree more, Shane. I think you hit it right on the head. All those things. We all go through it. And you can't. Good people around you and you keep pushing and lean into it and you can't. Yeah. And then last thing, shout out to the military.
  Speaker 3
  I mean, just going and seeing the service people and what they've been through and that inspiring you and then also being there with you. I mean, like, I feel like that moment in it of the people around you and getting to see, like you said, like think about the time you see gratitude, We're talking about a fucking injury That could have ended your life at some point.
