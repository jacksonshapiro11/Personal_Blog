### Highlights

- Prioritize Urgency Over Reverence
  Summary:
  For effective leadership and company growth, it's crucial to foster a culture of self-deprecation and urgency.
  Emphasizing that taking oneself too seriously can impede progress, a focus on practical goals such as product improvement, revenue generation, and profitability is essential. Leaders should provoke thought and challenge complacency, as maintaining past operational methods threatens the company's future.
  A call to action is necessary, lacking the comfort of politeness, in order to capture attention and stimulate a proactive mindset among team members for overall success.

  The challenge for me is how do I get your attention? Call me a schmuck and that's fine. Call me disrespectful of somebody, then you need to prove it. I don't think anything I've said anywhere was directed at anything more than this company lives without the 11th commandment. And god damn it all, we better get that 11th commandment back on the front page here. The 11th commandment is thou shall not take oneself seriously. Nobody is more self-deprecating than I am. If I can get everybody in this room to be self-deprecating instead of worrying about what's politically correct or what's not, instead worry about how do we win? How do we succeed? How do we put out a better product? How do we make more revenue? How do we make a profit? How do we provide for our retirement? Those are the challenges. The real question for me is how do I get your attention? How do I get you to have a sense of urgency? How do I get you to understand that the future of this company is currently right out there in front of us? And if we keep operating the way we've been operating in the past, there is no future. Plain and simple. So you tell me, how do I get everyone's attention? Do I just say, please, hi, I'm here, and I'm here to make all nice to you. We're not going to reduce any employment. We're just going to keep going on losing money. And then one day, it's all going to be over. So how am I supposed to get your attention? I went over the line on purpose, not accidentally. ([Time 0:04:20](https://share.snipd.com/snip/50a98239-7d3a-4fe6-adcd-0bdcf3f2a3d7))
    - **Note:** Don’t worry about what politically correct and be self deprecating if you need to. Live on the edge, be constantly pushing forward. Don’t worry about what Sam‘s gonna say worry about how to win. Money talks bullshit walls mindset. Don’t worry about failure. Get the next one. Lawson failure are part of life no one who has ever been great has never failed. Losing is apart of winning. Sam is relentlessly insatiable curiosity. Business is about continuing to learn, not a battle to be waged, but a problem to be solved. Always learning. True entrepreneurs never fail. He said this after his biggest failure. Relentless self belief. Easy to interface and hates competition. Reputation is the most important asset in long-term relationships. Sam never tries to screw people over. Anti competition anti following the herd. People see zell as an investor but he always saw himself as an entrepreneur
- Embrace Opportunity Without Boundaries
  Summary:
  A professional opportunist thrives in competitive landscapes by recognizing potential in diverse sectors beyond their primary expertise.
  True entrepreneurship involves following instincts and maintaining a flexible mindset in business ventures, often disregarding conventional rules. Successful entrepreneurial strategies focus on acquiring companies within growth industries or those facing financial distress, aiming to revitalize them into market leaders.
  Notably, the absence of synergies amongst properties can actually present an advantage, allowing for a broader array of opportunities without the pressure of integration.
  This adaptable and instinctive approach fosters resilience and innovation in uncertain business environments.

  So we bought it and shared it enthusiastically with our new friends. At some point, the guy I was sitting next to me turned and asked, so what do you do? I replied, I'm a professional opportunist. And that has been my response to that question ever since. And so when real estate becomes crowded and competitive, Sam and Bob start buying companies. And this is a description of that. They carried no preconceived notions about how to buy and sell companies outside of real estate, but they viewed that as an asset rather than a liability. Zell believe that true entrepreneurs follow their instincts based on what they see around them and take a common sense approach to the game of buying, running and selling companies. They set no hard and fast rules about what companies they would buy. Potential deals merely had to have the same basic characteristics. A company in a growth industry, in financial trouble or distress, which could be managed out of its doldrums and into a potential market leader. And when I read that part in this book, I thought of what Sam said in his autobiography. He says, it has never occurred to me to question whether I should do something simply because I hadn't done it before. And another contrarian thing that he was doing among people buying a bunch of businesses at the time is he wasn't looking for synergies. He says synergies among his corporate properties were non-existent, and he liked that just fine. So they do this throughout the 80s, and then we see this reoccurring thing. ([Time 0:28:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5a8d5865-7bca-43de-b3d1-f57956a39fba))
    - **Note:** Never thought he shouldn’t do something just cause he hadn’t done it before. Focus on avoiding competition. It’s not supposed to be easy. He’s in for the challenge and he’s a systems thinker wants to understand how everything works high level. He’s very competitive. Has a few principles he lives by. Zell didn’t care what others thought about him strong internal locus of control. Design a life you want to live and live it. Go for freedom. He’s always willing to say what’s on his mind. Nothing is bought everything is sold. He wants to live a life that’s authentic to him, but has the same feelings of doubt we all deal with. He lives with a lot of fear and doesn’t do business with people who aren’t afraid. Fear and courage are cousins. When he fell fear, he moved forward, made it push him from behind instead of standing in his way. He was great at. Simple ideas repeated. He shuts out the noise. Remains intensely curious. His head is constantly looking forward. Only an idiot looks back and thinks it’s over.
- Embrace Simplicity and Stay Curious
  Summary:
  Focus on essential business principles that drive cash flow and create value, emphasizing the significance of simplicity in communications, such as keeping briefings to a single page.
  Maintain the conviction to ignore distractions and learn continuously, recognizing that failure is part of the entrepreneurial journey—learn from the past but don't dwell on it. Embrace non-conformity and prioritize personal freedom, choosing to engage only in activities that bring joy.
  Share knowledge and experiences with others, viewing mentorship as an obligation to the next generation.
  Understand that achieving professional success is a long-term endeavor, not a quick process.
  Aim high and challenge oneself to think big, recognizing that business is more about solving puzzles than waging battles. Ultimately, strive to make a meaningful difference in all spheres of life.

  Sam is a brilliant guy and has a number of sayings that as you get older, you have more appreciation for. Things like, let the asset be what it wants to be. Or if you're not the lead dog, the view never changes. He's an extremely unique individual. He can take almost any business and have an impact and make it better. He would tell you that his concepts are pretty consistent. Ultimately, everything is driven by cash flow. If you focus on what the real cash flows are and what you can do to impact those cash flows, that ultimately is what creates value. The basic business concepts are consistent. Another important thing to repeat is the fact that Zell just got right to the essence of all these deals. It's something he learned from Jay Pritzker. He says, Zell, I love this, Zell insists that briefings be kept to a single page no matter how complicated a deal or issue. Anything more is summarily dismissed. For Zell, simple ideas and concepts have yielded the highest rewards. He said, having conviction means that you can shut out the noise. It's amazing how many of these descriptions and principles are repeated about Zell from people all throughout his career that knew him. Zell insists that he's constantly eager to learn and to do rather than sitting pat with what he's already learned in his life. He is intensely curious. So many people describe him as intensely curious. The bottom line, and then he repeats this again, and the fact that he's not going to beat himself up. Failure is inevitable. It's part of every entrepreneur's journey. Move forward. Do not look back. The bottom line is what happened in the past stays in the past. My head only looks forward. It doesn't turn backwards. He repeats that over and over and over again. Another great quote from Zell, the true test of an entrepreneur is someone who spends his life constantly testing his limits. The definition of an idiot is someone who has reached his goals. And then this could almost be like Zell's mantra. Non-conformity is wonderful. And I think Zell took his own advice because he says Zell likes to set his own agenda. He says, I'm a guy who has an extraordinary good time. I'm a guy who really focuses on not being anywhere I don't want to be and not doing anything that I don't want to do. And so that's why I think his main advice when I talk to him, that one he repeated over and over again is go for freedom. You know, he's saying, hey, I'd like to set my own agenda. I'd like to have a good time. I'm a guy who really focuses on not being anywhere I don't want to be and not doing anything I don't want to do. One of the things I printed out to prepare to talk to you was my notes that, like the main takeaways from the lunch I had with him. And one of the things was that you have an obligation to share what you learn that Sam flew all over the world to talk to other entrepreneurs at his expense, just to teach everything he Learned. He considered it an obligation to pass knowledge onto the next generation. And so there's a, there's a couple of examples in this book where he's giving talks, you know, and in many cases he's doing so at business school. And this is one of my favorite exchange that ever happened. It's going to be very like Charlie Munger-esque. A favorite Zell classroom moment came during one of his frequent visits to the Wharton School of Business. And at the end of the talk, there's Q&A and it says one of the kids said, I think you're really great and I admire you and all that you've done. I want to be like you in five years. Sam looked at him and said, why the hell do you get to be like me in five years when it took me 40? And this is perfect. The point was not becoming him. It was that becoming whoever you are is going to be an ongoing process. And that professional success is not crafted in five years. It's crafted in a lifetime. We talked about one of his favorite books. This is one of his favorite quotes. One of Zell's favorite quotes is from the American architect Daniel Burnham, who famously said, make no little plans. They have no magic to stir men's blood and probably themselves will not be realized. Make big plans, aim high in hope and work. And I think a few pages later, he gives his own interpretation of that quote. He says, everything I do is motivated by doing it right, by doing it better, by doing it different, by answering the questions that other people couldn't. Remember that excellent quote from his autobiography, business is not a battle to be waged. It's a puzzle to be solved. I really do believe that what drove him is the challenge. And then when the book ends, Zell is turning 68 years old, and he's asked what message he would like to have on his tombstone. Zell responded without thinking. He was a man of his word. Most important of all, whether it be in the business world, the philanthropic world, or the sports world, I want to make a difference. That's what motivates me.

Non conformity is wonderful. Enjoys being present in the now all the time. Life should be constantly spent testing the limits. never looked back. Control your time set your own agenda. Professional and personal success isn’t crafted in five years, but in a lifetime. Be a man of your world. Motivated by constant progress. Make big plans aim high hope it works. Move forward don’t look back.
