### Highlights

- **Respect and Collaboration in Relationships**
  - Approach conversations as a team, especially regarding finances or future plans.
  - View these discussions as opportunities to design your lives together, not as negotiations.
  - Start with open-ended conversations about what money or the future means to each of you and share personal experiences.
  - Don't try to reach specific outcomes immediately; treat the first conversation as one of many.
  - Create decision points in your relationship where you consciously assess your direction, avoiding sliding through major transitions passively.

  And I think he's right about really big issues. And so I feel so lucky that I have this person as my decision maker partner, where I can really say like, I have this opportunity. This is how far away it is. Do you think I should do it? And when we talk through it at the end of the conversation, like I either agree with him or he's helped me come to the right decision for myself. And when people have partners where they don't really trust or admire or respect them, like I couldn't be in that relationship. And so I think that as parents, you're just constantly making decisions. And that's why I feel even closer to him than ever before, because I'm like, we're really basically partners in this big class project. And it's been really fun. That's awesome.

  Do you agree with the time boxing or the ultimatum, I guess, as you called it, or sort of like these points where you artificially create this? One point for people who are not younger and maybe dating again is, do you meet the kids? Yeah.
  Logan Ury
  So I think that the ultimatum, I mean, that term is even loaded at this point because there's like this Netflix show about the ultimatum. And I think when people hear that, they probably have a negative assumption of somebody being like, if you don't propose by the end of the year, we're breaking up. Like, that doesn't sound collaborative to me. But I actually do think that decision points are very important in life and in relationships. So there's this great research about, you know, people eating cookies. So like in one part of the experiment, people just eat cookies in a sleeve and they just eat the whole sleeve of cookies until it's over. And then they're like, damn, I just ate a lot of cookies. In another part of the experiment, in between every few cookies are these colored pieces of wax paper. And when you get to the piece of colored wax paper, you think like, do I want to keep going or not? And it creates a decision point that makes you consciously decide, do I go forward or not? And so I think that relationships do offer these decision points. Do we want to be exclusive? Do we want to move in together? Do we want to get married? Do we want to have kids? And each of those is an opportunity to check in with the other person. And so sometimes creating that by saying, hey, let's go away for a weekend and talk about our future, you're really shining a light on an important topic that impacts both of you. And so maybe I'll take back the word ultimatum and instead say, I want people to make conscious choices. I want them to be deciding, not sliding through relationship transitions.
  Shane Parrish
  How do you have those hard conversations in a secure way where a lot of people might interpret them as like, oh no, the relationship's over. They close up, they get defensive. How do you structure them in a way where both people stay open and they're trying to solve the problem together? It's like, we have a problem or we have a decision point, but we're both on the same side of the table. How do we deal with this versus the perception that one person might have that, oh God, it's over. I'm going to start protecting myself. And the minute they do that, it becomes almost a self-fulfilling prophecy.
  Logan Ury
  So there's definitely people who are more experts on this than I am. Like a lot of people love Marshall Rosenberg who wrote Nonviolent Communication or even I think some of the work by different negotiation experts is really helpful because you say, How can we solve this together? So I really encourage people to seek out those resources. But some of the things that I can say are really approaching things from being a team. So we as a team are thinking about our financial future. And this is, you know, I don't know if you know Ramit Sethi, but sort of some of Ramit's work where it's like, what is our rich life? Let's sit down together and have a fun, generative conversation around our rich life. And isn't that fun to think about what we could achieve together versus, hey, I save a lot more money than you do. I don't want your debts to be mine. It's like we're adversaries. And so how can you come at it from a place of we get to do this really exciting thing of design our lives together. Let's have a conversation about it versus this is a negotiation where one of us wins and the other loses.
  Shane Parrish
  There's no one size fits all, but money is a great point, right? How do you have those conversations when maybe there's a huge income gap or do you have a joint account or do you have separate accounts? And how does that work? Does having a large income gap correlate to problems in a relationship?
  Logan Ury
  I truly do pull on Ramit's work for a lot of this stuff. You know, he has this great podcast where he interviews couples and money and he has a new book, Money for Couples. And I just did a newsletter with him where it was about how to have the first money conversation. And some of the key tips are things like it's the first conversation, it's not the only conversation. So maybe it's just where you open up and you talk about what does money mean to you? What was your family's relationship with money? When you think about money, what feelings does it evoke? And so just having a conversation where more people are sharing versus having a conversation that needs to come to a specific outcome. Like, well, I make two times what you make, so I should pay two times the rent. It's like, you don't have to get into all the tactical stuff right away. I think approaching it as the first of one of many conversations is a really healthy idea because I just went to this event that Ramit had and ([TimeÂ 1:41:13](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d2751778-d8f3-4083-b417-82902d7a97d6))
