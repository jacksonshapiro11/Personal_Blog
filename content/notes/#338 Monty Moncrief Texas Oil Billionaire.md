- Monty built a business around oil and focus. He kept it in the family never incorporated was the strong patriarch that everyone measured themselves by like his sons and grandsons which is very dangerous. Texas oil people and family was vital and he was always measured by his family and grandpa in Texas. His grandpa came back from WW1 and found unlimited opportunity in oil. Family is destiny in Texas. This unlimited opportunity wasn’t there in oil for his sons but different unlimited opportunity is always present came into the land of an open frontier everywhere they looked they saw empty land and opportunity so they built dynasty’s around the land shaping it in their own image. Gabe shape to business and a way of life. Unlimited opportunities come from un consolidated industry. These people never asked cerebral questions they just got action default aggressive. Learn by doing opportunity had to be open to small teams with no money. When Monty started up you could spend 20k and find oil near the surface but over time you couldn’t find oil at 5k feet but needed 30k feet that’s when the opportunity was gone.

    - **Note:** Monty built his industry with ruthless focus but his entire family felt they needed to live up to him which is dangerous
      unlimited opportunity is always present there is always a frontier but its always changing and never clear in the moment. these men shapes the industry in their vision. Industry us consolidated by men of action. You learn by doing there are no rules when the knowledge is available and the rules are clear the differential returns are gone. Need to be default aggressive
- Riding the wave the us is the only country where owning the land gives you the mineral rights under it as well. That enabled this. He was able to get deals with a bunch of small farmers where bigger names would go overseas and negotiate with one big player. He was focused not diversified. Limitless opportunity comes in areas with less regulation. Monty could build anything but by the end you couldn’t do much. The same personality prickly individuality they never quit ran the businesses until they died. Monty never spent money lived in the same house his whole love wanted achievement not money. They respected men of action but usually looked down on them thinking they were greater. Respected Nixon for holding office but thought he was a better man.

  Summary:
  A wildcatter named Monty faced a series of failed oil drilling attempts, earning him the nickname 'dry hole Monty'.
  Despite setbacks, he believed he had a gift for finding oil. Before a major turning point, a reference from 'The Fish that Ate the Whale' emphasized seizing opportunities even when resources are limited.
  This mindset led Monty to an incredible oil discovery, highlighting the importance of acting boldly in the face of uncertainties.

  Speaker 1
  And so these wildcatters raise money and they start drilling holes. Monte's first 29, his first 29 wells all come up empty. So at the beginning of his career, remember, he still thinks he's born lucky. He was destined to it. I have a gift. This is the way he's talking about have a gift for finding oil. Imagine believing that, right? Quitting your job, moving states, raising money first 29 times. They're all duds. They start calling him dry hole Monty. That was the situation right before he hits one of the largest oil discoveries ever. There is actually, let me read this to you. There's a great line I think about all the time in the book, The Fish that Eight the Whale, which is about Sam's and Murray. And it talked about this. It's such that he goes and accumulates assets when he does not have the money to do so because he believed if he did not get those assets, his business in the future wouldn't work out anyways. There is some degree of, for some reason, when I got to this section of the book, I was thinking about this line, this paragraph that's in The Fish that Eight the Whale. So let me read that paragraph to you first and then we'll get into this incredible discovery that Monty is a young Monty, Mont Creek. His son is I think 11 years old when this is about to happen, but this is the line from The Fish that Eight the Whale. There are times when certain cards sit unclaimed in the common pile. When certain properties become available that will never be available again, a good businessman feels these moments like a fall in the barometric pressure. A great businessman is dumb enough to act on them even when he cannot afford to. And so when a real estate trader by the name of B.A. Skipper comes and asks, Monty, if he wants to buy these leases, this is what happens. So B.A. ([Time 0:25:28](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8292ddaa-b8d0-4208-8de3-e08941116c33))
    - **Note:** Monty was default optimist and believed he had divine rock and he met and Oklahoma oil family in World War I got his start, negotiating titles for land with families, and decided to strike out on his own and moved to Texas. His first near 30 wells were dry and he kept the faith and hit one of the biggest wells in the world it’s gone. Stayed default optimistic kept pushing. Monty found someone who was flipping land he had no money he borrowed it to buy this land and partnered with an oil company to drill it. This was his big break he sold it for 2mm in a couple years it was later sold for 37mm. He never regretted selling to early he believed there was no what if just what is. He used this to build his empire, and was always suspicious of paper fortunes. If this failed, he would’ve lost it all been an idiot. It’s a massive stroke of luck he didn’t have a survey done on the land just bought it. These people believed in their luck no fear of failure and used a ton of debt.

  Oh, no, it's not 150, is it? I don't know why I'm guessing. I can just look it up. It is episode 149, 150 Sam Walton. So 149. I'd listen to episode but also read the book. The Big Rich is excellent. I'm going to wind up rereading it and doing another podcast on it in the future because I thought the book was fantastic. But so Clint Murchison's in there as well. They were one-time partners with Sid Richardson. And you might find this interesting Clint Murchison's son. It was actually the founder of the Dallas Cowboys. So what they have in common, they believe in luck. They have an absence of fear of disgrace as we just saw. They're failing over and over again. They just keep getting back up and going at it. As we just saw with Monty, he was 0 and 29 and he was still going at it. And 30 was, you know, changed his life. And really not only changed his life, but changed the trajectory of many generations of his family. They're also not scared of having tons of debt. There's a great exchange between Sid Richardson and Clint Murchison in the book. And Sid tells Clint, I must be the richest one between us because I owe more money than you do. They've got paper of mine floating all the way to London. Sid believed that this is crazy. Sid had an attitude that there was no innate shampleness in going broke or in barring as long as there was a reason for it. They all were delusional optimists. They believe that optimism was the personal quality, that nurtures luck. ([Time 0:34:45](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ae8da7ba-e15d-4891-9a4c-a84231c10751))
    - **Note:** These people were delusional optimist they hated timidity, and they levered the fuck up there was no shame in going, broke specially if you had taken good risk, and had a good reason. If they didn’t have big losses they didn’t feel like you were taking enough risk. Event every rule, and believe in chaos and defiance refused to be controlled The risk was always there, and they were never afraid of risk they sought. They were stubborn unreasonable, crazy optimistic. They want to build dynasties, and this was key to their success. 100 years ago the government said 40% of us oil reserves was depleted they saw the industry as dead and it couldn’t have been more wrong we’re producing 100x more oil a day today. The people doing this we’re poor. They slept in tents they were broke and optimistic lived on hopes. Wildcatters could only go up. People thought the wildcatter were nuts, but being crazy and having imagination was their edge, they found 80% of the oil and often with drilling places where the bigger companies rejected the mineral rights. He was still working at 80 measures his life by hard work and achievement not refinement.
