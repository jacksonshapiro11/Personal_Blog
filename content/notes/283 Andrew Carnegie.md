  And so he took this to the extreme where he's like, I'm even going to sell off any stocks I have of outside of my business because I don't want any of my mental processing power directed at anything other than my steel company, which this wind up being a genius level move most of which most people just do the exact opposite, especially in today's modern age. They're completely distracted where all your attention should go into your business. They included some stocks and securities that were quoted on the New York Stock Exchange. And I found that when I opened my paper in the morning, I was tempted to look first at the quotations of the stock market. When you wake up in the morning, what Andrew's telling us, you should be focused on your business and improving that, not on your investments. As I determined to sell my interest in every outside business and concentrate my attention upon my manufacturing, I further resolved not to even own any stocks. And he's saying this was such a good idea for me for my career. Most people don't do it. And this is why he feels is a good idea. Such a course should be commended itself to every man in the manufacturing business and to all professional men for the manufacturing man, especially his mind must be kept calm and free if he's decide wisely the problems which are continually coming before him. This is something that Jeff Bezos talked about last week. He tells in the long run, like good judgment and no sound judgment can remain with the man whose mind is disturbed by the material changes of the stock market. His mind is upon the stocks and not upon the points that require calm thought. And so he picks up the same idea later on, quotes that quote I just said, he said, I had become interested in building railroads in the western states that seemed like a giant opportunity, but he realized the greatest opportunity.

    - **Note:** Structure your life so your mind is calm. A disturbed mind is unproductive to its core.
