  Are you building a business? Well, if you haven't already been asked by potential customers or investors about SOC 2, ISO 27001 or HIPAA compliance, you likely will be soon. Achieving compliance can unlock major growth for your company and build a foundation of trust, but can also be time-consuming and tedious. Vanta can help. Vanta automates up to 90% of compliance work, getting you audit ready in weeks and saving you significant costs. And Vanta scales with your business, helping you enter new markets and land bigger deals and earn customer loyalty. Listeners get $1,000 off Vanta when they go to vanta.com slash knowledge. That's v-a-n-t-a.com slash knowledge. I think, you know, the theme of this podcast is probably going to be how do we get the best out of ourselves. And maybe that's a good place to start. That's a very open-ended question, but people come to you and they come to you with a need and that need is performance. I need to perform. I need to get the best out of myself, whether it's in two days or in two weeks or consistently over a period of time. Now what? Like, how do we do that? What does that mean?
  Speaker 1
  Okay, so for the long term, from my experience, the quality of your mentors and the people that you have around you plays a massive role in you not stepping in stupid more than you need To. I've been a byproduct of mentorship. ([Time 0:04:27](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a0fcf130-6c6e-47c5-8394-4693e2f6efc9))
    - **Note:** Quality of mentors and mentorship is vital to success. Get around high quality high value people and doors open. Environment is more important to success than your skills. Cultivating your identity is important. Apprenticeship and playing the long game is vital. Success is more about avoiding stupid mistakes than making great decisions. Patience isn’t about going slow run like hell but don’t expect overnight success. Success is a slog. Don’t look to master 18 different methods but focus on being great at a few key things. Great product over features. More is the enemy of success. Thinking time vs procrastination

  Speaker 1
  Well, from my experience, one of the major things that causes that, Shane, is the lack of admitting to yourself what it is that you actually want. So many people that have come to me and they feel stuck or they feel maybe they built a business that has trapped them in some way and they're trying to figure it out and they're kind of delaying On taking some of the actions that they know they should be doing. I'll just ask them, did you accidentally build this business? We make these assumptions that we sat down and we said, I'm going to build that business right there. And it was such a smart intention. I'm an accidental entrepreneur. A lot of people, I think, have gotten themselves through just great action into a corner, but it's not really what they want. I think that the reason that many people would have levels of dissatisfaction or they aren't maybe taking the inspired action that they're supposed to be taking is because it's not What they actually want. And they know that. And I think most people really don't sit down and be really honest with themselves about what it is that they truly want to be doing. And one of the reasons that they don't is because if you, Shane, were to actually pursue the thing you want and start taking action on it, you're losing the excuse of hope. I think hope is a double edged sword, like everything in nature. It can't only be good because nature tells us that that doesn't work. Hyperhidrosis and hypo hydrosis. Water isn't always good. When you and I are floating in the middle of the ocean, the last thing I want is more water, unless it's rain water to help me fuel my body. And hope is the same way. Hope can't only be good because if I'm hoping that maybe someday I'm going to be an actor in Hollywood, and that's always just a dream in my mind. But I never take action on it. It's actually a place of safety and security because the moment I take action on it, I no longer have that warm blanket of hope that someday maybe I'll be able to go and do it. And I think that many people stay stuck where they are not pursuing the things that they really want to do because of hope.
  Speaker 2
  Is hope the difference between interested and committed then?
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, great question. It would play a part. It would play a part. And then some of those other things that get in the way there between interesting commitment or the things that you had brought up earlier, whether it's the fear of rejection, the fear Of losing face somehow, the fear of testing your skills because we think we're kind of good at something. And maybe we're not. I'll give you an example. Well, I'm trying to scale a software company with two co-founders for people in the coaching space. And I love putting myself back into that what I call the field of play constantly because I want to test myself. Todd, you can give this advice very good to other people. But how good are you at following product market fit methodology? How good are you at defining a specific target market to get traction inside of and sticking with it? So for me, going back to that whole like that fear of not taking action, I have a real fear of inaction because I want to test myself.
  Speaker 2
  Where does that fear of inaction come from?
  Speaker 1
  One is cultural. Definitely cultural influences from your, whether it's your childhood. I'm not a therapist. I don't do that kind of work with people. But ideas that people have about what the taking action is going to mean or the negative responses that they had when they were younger that really created a strong narrative about how Bad it is to go and take action on something. And then again, it's the fear of losing the hope because if I always live in inaction, but I still have my hope of like doing it, I'm not going to lose that. That warm feeling that I have about daydreaming about that thing. And I'm not confronted with the realities. And then the fear of uncertainty is another thing. Will I lose the money if I invested it this way into my business? And will I lose my time? Oh geez, what else am I going to be missing out on if I actually stay committed to this one thing and become very myopic in trying to channel my energies towards that? ([Time 0:16:44](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2dac5737-e18d-437e-9bfa-a59fe18d646a))
    - **Note:** Positioning is vital we underestimate the importance of how many assumptions we’re making. An investment with 5 assumptions and a 5% higher return is worse than 1 assumption. The greats embrace boring things and don’t live for the highlight reels. Win the game in the field not Facebook. Hope is dangerous because it makes you think you can do things without actually doing it. The hope of becoming a famous actor is dangerous because it makes us feel good when we try and fail and no longer have that hope it’s worse than never trying. 2 sides to all things hope and water could be good or bad. You have no idea the version of you on the other side of commitment. Commitment is a forcing function on your skills you need to keep a belief that it’s hard and unclear but you’ll figure it out fundamental belief stumble fall and get back up. Courage to figure it out along the way. The more you test yourself and challenge yourself the more you evolve and improve.

  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  The coaching thing is interesting because it made me think of imposter syndrome where you said believe in yourself enough that you can get the best coaching. And imposter syndrome is kind of a way that we, maybe bully ourselves a bit.
  Speaker 1
  I have a really hard time with that phrase, Shane. It basically was non-existent in the 2000s. Imposter syndrome is a new term anyway. It's actual route where it came from was two ladies in Texas in the 1970s. And it was actually called imposter phenomenon. And what it was there to explain was in this new world of work where women were both coming into and building careers for themselves. And they were also still holding that main role of being a caretaker at home. They felt like they were kind of being imposters in both like they weren't good at either of them. And then in 2010 when Instagram came around, you can see it literally in Google's search algorithm. Imposter syndrome starts to take off. Well, some of that was because people were now posturing with veneers of their lives online. There was now filters to our photos to make ourselves look better or be more stylish. And then you have the rise of influencers who now have these easily accessed platforms to talk to people about subject matter. They have no expertise in whatsoever. They have no nuance of understanding around it whatsoever. So imposter syndrome, I think, has become a catch-all term for all of the mental maladies of human beings and it's crap to me. Really, it only is three things. One, imposter syndrome is, or imposter phenomenon, would be that you have sort of given up all of your successes in life, your achievements to luck, right place, right time. Nowadays, it's privilege and a bunch of different terms now.
  Speaker 2
  You're not responsible for anything that's happened. Yeah, and you dismiss it, basically.
  Speaker 1
  And that's very toxic to your overall level of confidence and level of self-efficacy, your belief in your ability to go and make things happen. That's what self-efficacy really means. And so to those people, I always give them the same piece of advice. What you've done is you're sitting at the poker table of life and you've robbed yourself of your chips. And so I keep this on my desk, Shane. So people are listening, I have a little glass jar and it has a whole bunch of poker chips inside of it. We need to do a really good job of owning our wins, owning the skills that we developed, owning the circumstances and situations that we've pulled ourselves out of that might have caused Other people to turn back and not enter the cave, so to speak, to use Joseph Campbell's words. Own those things. And there's a great story from the former CEO of Levi's where when they were going into China, he was very concerned that it wasn't gonna be successful. And stressing about it, losing sleep over it. And he has this journal that he keeps on his desk. And he broke down his entire life into three year increments from zero to two and three to five and six and on and on and on. And what he did was he catalogued all the things that he learned and all the skills that he developed and knowledge he gained, a wisdom he'd gained throughout all these periods of his Life. And he'd pick it up and he'd flip through it. And the reason he'd flip through it is because at the end of flipping through it, he would always come to the conclusion, oh, no matter what gets thrown in my way, I'll figure it out. Like, look it, I'm just proving that over time. And so I say that because to that person who discounts themselves, like they do, with who am I to go after that, stack the confidence chips, play at the poker table of life with your actual Chips that you've earned over time. So that's one thing, so we discount. The second thing that Imposter Phenomenon is actually about is the fear and the concern or the worry of what that people are gonna find you out, that you're not as good as they think that You are. Now, that kind of diverges into two roads. If you're someone who's posturing and positing a sense of skill sets and competencies that are not rooted in truth whatsoever, then here's the reality, you should be found out. But for those that feel like they're gonna be found out, I just tell them the same thing. Stack your chips, go back. Like, are you trying to posture like this perfect persona of every single poem ([Time 0:28:21](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9ddb239e-16a7-4895-9bd9-e39cd76c5ff1))
    - **Note:** You need to surround yourself with great people who mentor you and take you under their wing. Imposter syndrome is a curse you should just look at all you accomplished and realize you have extreme agency when you cave into imposter syndrome you’re voluntarily giving up your agency but there are so many times where others failed at points where you succeeded and you need to hold your hat on those successes and realize you’re not an imposter. Imposter syndrome is a lack of self belief and this is death. You have earned it don’t postire perform.
- Importance of subtracting things in developing performance
  Key takeaways:
  - Developing performance often involves subtracting and simplifying one's responsibilities and commitments.
  - Being useful and valuable is more important than achieving success.
  - Subtracting, removing, and deleting are part of the process of becoming more valuable.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  I wanna come back to environment for a second in terms of how much of success for knowledge workers gets out of the realm of athletes here for a second, but probably relates to athletes As well, is subtracting things, like your environment, your surface area of responsibilities naturally grows, your surface area of projects you wanna take on, of commitments that You have, of people reaching in more successful, you are the more people reach out to you. How much of developing performance is getting reps in what you're good at, which means subtracting all of these other things. So getting rid of priorities, simplifying your life and not letting this surface area continuously expand.
  Speaker 1
  Well, it's undeniable that that's a major part of that process of being more valuable. Because we were talking before about success and I don't like that term. I think in the terms of being useful and being valuable, the more useful you are, the more valuable you are, then whatever success is gonna happen is gonna happen, I think. But when I'm working with people, we subtract, we remove, and we delete. ([Time 0:34:03](https://share.snipd.com/snip/27959c6b-6001-45de-91d0-04a4282ceb21))
    - **Note:** Success is about focus subtract remove and delete what isn’t the main thing to focus/ achieve success. People over extend and get burned out instead of working on the most important highest leverage thing possible look long term with high roi not dopamine hits. Dont think short term view your life in thematic decades. Steve Martin dedicated his 20s to getting good at comedy. Commitment to the bit prevents short term behavior
- The Equation of Trust in the Present Moment
  Key takeaways:
  - Trust in the moment is built on past preparation.
  - Effective preparation involves practicing in various conditions.
  - Trust in the future depends on trusting your plan.
  - Having multiple plans can be beneficial.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I want to do everything I possibly can to help that person in that moment trust themselves. Well, what is the equation of trust in that moment? Well, past tense, that's where all of your preparation comes in. Did you show up? Did you do the work? Have you put in the reps? Did you prepare yourself on not only the days where it was a little bit overcast so that it wasn't too sunny and it was not slushy or it wasn't icy? Did you only ever practice with being the first person to take the run around the freshly groomed slope? Or did you also practice being the 26th person to go around those gates with tracks already grooved in? Things starting to get a little bit slushy and a little bit icy where your skis start to slip a little bit, have you practiced the slipping of the edges of your, if you have, and all those Things are an affirmative, great, I've built up trust in your preparation. Yeah. Then it gets to the future. Do you trust the future? The future is your plan. Do you trust your plan? The way that you're gonna go down those gates? Do you have multiple plans? Cause oh shit, today you're in the 18th slot. ([Time 0:45:03](https://share.snipd.com/snip/aafe2c2b-c56b-41e8-bbdd-8f6f6814e0b1))
    - **Note:** Have you done the work to succeed in the moment. No one hits a game winning shot that’s a result of 10k shots. Skiing at the Olympics have you only trained in perfect conditions or did you train the worst case that’s where you win when you do the worst case shit. Pressure is something we invent in our mind it isn’t like gravity. Build the alter ego like Kobe built the black mamba that lets you go to that dark place or even as a parent that lets you go to that place of love. Feedback loops for parenting are longer than business how do you square that. Completely different investment. You need to accepting in some domains you need to play a game you don’t like and you need to play it well. Relationships are a very long term game with unclear feedback and slow results. We have many identities and stories we tell ourselves about who we are but we are not these these are tools. We can be someone who pushes and prods some but just loves and is a therapist to others. Do you want advice or afffirmatin. Distance your core self from the identities you occupy. Being different archetypes to your different roles don’t get stuck in one archetype transcend paradigms. Dissasociate from your identity.
- The Decision to Write Publicly Despite Disliking Attention
  Key takeaways:
  - The speaker chose to write publicly despite not seeking attention.
  - The speaker has a stoic demeanor and does not rely on others for validation.
  - Writing publicly was a struggle for the speaker due to their dislike of attention.
  - The initial platform used by the speaker was not FS dot blog, but a different format.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  But why did you do it publicly though? Well, because I'm sorry, I'm not, not interrupt you again, but you don't, you don't have the sort of public avatar of someone who needs to be followed. Like there's many people that are like, I can tell by the way that they show up on social media that they need to feed off of the energy of other people to validate their existence in life. You don't because you have far more sort of stoic way about you. So it's just fascinating to me that you chose to write in public.
  Speaker 2
  Well, this is super interesting in two ways. One, I hate attention. So I actually like, it's a struggle for me in a lot of ways to go on social media and, you know, write a book and put it out there and do all of these things because it's like, oh, God, it just Means more attention. And then so the way that it started, it wasn't actually FS dot blog, which it is now. It was 68131 dash 1440 dot blah blah blah blah blah. And the reason is so 68131 is the zip code for Berkshire Hathaway, which is Farnham Street. ([Time 1:11:54](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a4959b7f-32d3-4ad4-8702-85cf7b6a816b))
    - **Note:** Create and shape different identities for different areas of your life. Focus in going from 90 to 90.1 in some fields is the big differentiator. Don’t be afraid to look like an idiot that’s death taking risk is vital in life but our ego holds us up. Don’t have a fixed idea of who you are. Taking risk with your identity is what leads to success. Don’t look for who you are but what you are. You’re a bunch of different complex skills integrated in one person. What are your deep core tenants of who you are. The greats have a deeper meaning and intention in their day it’s not going through the motions. Add meaning what is it doing where is it taking you. What vision is being driven by the action. When you have discipline toward a goal. Rituals help shape people and we’ve lost it but it helps shape our mindset for what we want. How do we do more than rote practice but embed meaning.
- The Connection Between Enclosed Cognition and Performance
  Key takeaways:
  - Kobe Bryant had a unique approach to preparing for games by communing with his mental game inside a cage
  - Clothed cognition can enhance performance by associating certain traits with specific attire
  - Creating rituals by combining routine/habit with storytelling can add meaning to actions
  - Kobe Bryant's alter ego, the Mamba, faced trash talk to protect his mental wellbeing
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  We'd build a cage and that thing lives inside the cage. And then they would open the cage and then the thing gets unleashed. Kobe was different in that he wanted to commune with it. So he got into the cage with it. And that's all the mental thing that's happening in the locker room before going out onto the court. And there's that trigger that's happening. And the great thing about triggers in the book I talk about in clothed cognition. And what in clothed cognition is is because I have a story about what it means to have a white doctor's coat on. You're detailed, you're methodical, you're careful, you're smart. If I actually put on a doctor's coat, I will enclose my cognitive traits in the abilities of smart, detailed, methodical and careful. Now, if I'm about to go do something that demands being careful and methodical and detailed, I've just elevated my performance, my ability to go and execute that because of wearing The thing. So for me, it was wearing a pair of non prescription glasses when I was 22 years old because I felt like I had a baby face. I looked like I was 12. It was getting in the way of me even believing that I was credible. And so I went and bought a pair of non prescription glasses for my alter ego, Super Richard, so I could step into a new identity that wasn't so worried about rejection. And Super Richard was specifically hired to do sales calls because I wasn't doing them. I was good at coaching, but I just wasn't good at promoting myself. So those rituals are, rituals is when routine or habit meets storytelling because that's meaning. It's not Kobe that's getting trash talk, it's the mamba that's getting trash talk now when it goes into the arenas and everyone's got these slurred chants because he's someone who's Just an abuser or whatever the case was. We had to create that for his own mental wellbeing. ([Time 1:28:27](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ec50f50f-b452-457d-b54c-c2bcbf94278c))
    - **Note:** Rituals are when routine and habit meets storytelling. That creates meaning. This guy created black mamba and Sasha fierce. Life is about creating yourself. Believe you can be this then actually do it. Visualization is a skill we need to really live in the situation. Write it out taste feel and smell it engage all senses. Don’t half ass. Use visualization in a dynamic way for what you want to think and feel. Imagine yourself as a fly on the wall what do you want others to say about you. Invite the right ideas into your mind. See goals to and through your goal isn’t to make the nba but to have a 15 year career in the nba. See goals to and through things and then you want to be an all star. Maybe you’re not complacent but you need to relax into the situation better. If you’re grinding try to do something average and in these situations athletes have done better because the pressure is off.
