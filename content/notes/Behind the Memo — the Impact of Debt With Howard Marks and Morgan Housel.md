### Highlights

- Episode AI notes
  1. Investing success hinges on identifying mispricing and managing volatility, with a critical view of debt as a limiting factor in investment strategies.
  2. Investors must choose between optimizing for long-term sustainability and maximizing immediate returns, as the latter can jeopardize survival during market downturns.
  3. Cognitive biases can lead investors to underestimate risks during prosperous times, highlighting the need for balance between greed and prudence.
  4. Future crises may take different forms but can evoke panic due to ingrained psychological responses; understanding these responses is crucial for effective risk management.
  5. Company profits can be volatile due to operating and financial leverage, with rising confidence leading to increased risk-taking, contributing to cyclical boom-bust patterns.
  6. Successful investing requires patience, diversification, and an understanding of historical context, especially regarding changing interest rates and societal norms.
  7. Investors should accept that losses are inherent to investment, focusing on managing risks rather than avoiding them to achieve long-term gains.
  8. It is essential to optimize debt levels based on individual risk tolerance, aiming for average performance sustained over long periods instead of chasing unsustainable high returns.
  9. Investors must maintain a balance between advanced strategies and fundamental principles, remaining humble and grounded in their approach to financial decisions. ([Time 0:00:00](https://share.snipd.com/episode-takeaways/16d2b4c1-0671-4932-af85-1a7b6d943499))
- Understanding the Dual Benefits of Investing
  Summary:
  Investing rewards individuals primarily through the identification of mispricing and the capacity to withstand volatility.
  Perceiving debt as a limitation that constricts potential outcomes enhances its importance in the investment strategy.

  Speaker 2
  All investments, you get paid for two things in investing. One is mispricing, the other is the endurance of volatility. And when you view debt as a narrowing of the outcomes that you can endure, it really takes on a new level of significance.

- Optimize for Survival, Not Maximize for Gain
  Summary:
  Investors face a critical choice between optimizing and maximizing their approaches.
  Optimizing focuses on long-term sustainability while maximizing seeks immediate returns, which may jeopardize survival during downturns. The risk of relying purely on averages is highlighted, as it disregards daily fluctuations in market realities.
  Investors should prepare for inevitable market declines and avoid over-leveraging, which increases vulnerability during tough periods.
  Historical patterns demonstrate that negative events recur, yet many fail to recognize their inevitability.
  Cognitive biases lead investors to forget past risks during prosperous times, often reinforcing their tendency to take on excessive risk. Balancing greed with prudence is essential, as unchecked greed prevails in favorable conditions, prompting a lack of preparedness for adverse scenarios. Investing risk can be categorized as macro risk, relating to external market changes, and psychological risk, concerning individual responses to those changes.

  Speaker 1
  Well, Morgan, a great observation. It's one I hadn't heard from you before, including the story of Rick Garren. But every investor has to make a choice at some point in time between optimizing and maximizing. Optimizing means you try to do well, but you also try to set up your fares so that you'll be able to last for the long term as Morgan describes. Maximizing is just trying to get the most you can the soonest you can. And that's the essence of what Morgan just went through. And this whole thing brings me back to one of my three favorite adages that in total, I think sum up the whole, well, 90% of what you have to know in the financial world. But never forget the person who was six feet tall, who drowned crossing the stream, it was five feet deep on average. The concept of surviving on average is meaningless. You got to survive every day. And that means you have to, importantly, survive on the bad days. And if you have set up your affairs to maximize, every step you take to maximize beyond an optimal point reduces your probability of survival. When you take on debt to own bigger positions to amplify your winnings when you win. It's like putting rocks in a knapsack and you're trying to cross that stream. The more rocks you have in the knapsack, the less likely you are to get across the stream when you hit a low point. Everybody makes investments for one reason. They think they're going to win. Nobody buys investments. Well, I want to have a diversified portfolio, so I should have some winners and some losers. Every investment that everybody makes, they think they're winners, but at the same time, they're not all going to be winners. And you have to be prepared for when things go against you. And that means optimizing, taking a reasonable approach in terms of the sum of your aggressive capital structure and your aggressive investments rather than maximizing.
  Speaker 2
  I think so much of investing history too is people claiming that an event, they say nobody could have seen this coming, who knew this was going to happen. And invariably the event is something that has occurred regularly every decade for the last 500 years. So I hope to be an investor for the next 30 to 50 years, let's say. What are the odds that during that period, I'm going to experience a 50% bear market and unemployment at 10% and inflation over 10%. What are the odds I'm going to experience those 100% The odds are 100% that I will experience those things. So when you come across somebody that has a portfolio that cannot endure anything close to that, basically what they're saying is, well, I will unwind this portfolio before that happens. And the odds of that happening round to zero as well. And that's why going through this endeavor at below your potential is actually the way to maximize wealth over the long term.
  Speaker 1
  Anna you're not going to get a chance to get a word in Edgewise.
  Speaker 3
  You're making my job too easy.
  Speaker 1
  But what Morgan says is extremely important. I love the book that I read in the middle 90s called A Short History of Financial Euphoria by John Kenneth Galbraith. And he says in there that one of the two outstanding characteristics of the investment universe is shortness of memory. When people have lived through a good time, they project that it will go on forever, and that the extreme negative occurrences that Morgan describes, which are a part of history, are Soon forgotten. And anybody who has memory of those negative events and harps on them is dismissed as an old fogey out of step with the modern times, unable to appreciate the wonders of the new industry, The new financial mechanisms, whatever they might be. This is so important.
  Speaker 3
  What you've both talked about so much here is investor psychology of investors not understanding how much risk they're actually taking, and that really being one of the riskiest things.
  Speaker 1
  Well, the riskiest thing in the world is the belief that there's no risk, when people believe that the environment is safe they will amp up the riskiness of the things they do to make sure That there's lots of risk. So real risk is self-reinforcing if you will. On the heels of good times people invariably tend to forget the possibility of negative outcomes. And we know the result. This is a good contributor to the cyclicality in our world. This forgetfulness of past lessons, it's very simple. When greed and prudence do battle, greed wins. It's very simple. So you have to be quite mature and adult in your approach to make sure that you assert some prudence to balance the greed.
  Speaker 2
  I would say too that at the high level there are two forms of investing risk. One, I guess you could call it macro risk, which is what is the market going to do to me? What's the economy going to do to me? And the other is psychological risk, which is how am I going to respond to that? ([Time 0:08:00](https://share.snipd.com/snip/80140712-9f05-4a7b-913e-8bb1afd53a49))
    - **Note:** Making your portfolio anti fragile with less leverage. Risk is self reinforcing. Psychology and macro risk.
- Anticipate Panic, Prepare for Reality
  Summary:
  The possibility of future crises may emerge in various forms, not necessarily mirroring historical events like the Great Depression or past wars.
  Initial impacts of COVID-19 were, in some respects, more severe than those at the onset of the Great Depression. Investors often misjudge their resilience to panic based on prior experiences, believing they can avoid similar reactions in future crises.
  However, psychological tendencies suggest that individuals might panic again, as these reactions are ingrained in their behavior.
  Hence, effective risk management should involve an asset allocation strategy that accounts for this inherent psychological vulnerability.
  Furthermore, people's perceptions of risk change dramatically in times of crisis; what seems like a great opportunity when markets are thriving may provoke panic in the face of actual threats, such as a global pandemic. Thus, understanding one's psychological responses in real-time scenarios is critical for making informed financial decisions.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  What's easy to overlook is that we're not going to have another Great Depression that played out exactly like the one did in the 1930s. But we can have other things that have equally terrible consequences. The early months of COVID by some metrics were worse than the early days of the Great Depression. So it's true that we're not gonna have that again. We're not gonna have that war again. We'll have other new wars that we are underestimating today. And then for psychological risk, people tend to think that they have learned their lessons in the past. So you have an investor who says, I panicked in October of 2008, but I learned my lesson. I'm not going to do it again. And most of the evidence in behavioral finance is yes, you will. That is an ingrained part of your personality. That is your brain chemistry that caused you to panic then. And you will probably panic again in the future. The solution to that is just embrace that that's who you are and have an asset allocation that understands that. What's really important here is that when things are going well in the economy, in the market, if you were to ask someone, how would you feel if the market fell 30%, let's say, and when Things are going well, people imagine a world in which everything is the same as it is today, except stock prices are 30% cheaper. And in that world, people are like, Oh, that would be great. That'd be an opportunity. I would love it. What you overlook is that the reason the market might fall 30% is because there's a terrorist attack or a war or a recession or a pandemic. And in that context, if I said, how would you feel if the market fell 30% because there's a virus that shuts down the global economy and might kill you and your family. In that context, people are like, I don't know. I might actually panic sell myself in that situation. So it's very difficult to understand how you will respond psychologically in the trenches, in the heat of the moment.

    - **Note:** Prepare and position for. Crisis. Bad things always happen.
- Cycles Are Inevitable: The Fragility of Optimism
  Summary:
  Company profits experience significant volatility driven by operating and financial leverage, creating a cycle where rising confidence leads to increased risk-taking and subsequent downturns.
  This boom-bust cycle is not merely a result of irrational behavior but an inherent characteristic of the financial system, as posited by Hyman Minsky’s financial instability hypothesis. As optimism grows, debt levels rise, making the economy more fragile and inevitably paving the way for recession.
  The relationship between asset valuations and volatility highlights how a lack of fluctuations can lead to future instability.
  Understanding this cyclical nature, marked by cause and effect, is crucial for navigating market dynamics.
  Past experiences, such as the surge in subprime mortgages leading to the financial crisis, exemplify how history can be misleading without recognizing the cyclical framework in which these events unfold.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Company profits rise and fall more because companies have leverage. They have operating leverage and financial leverage. And so company profits are much more volatile than the economy. But stock prices, for example, vary like crazy. They fluctuate up and down. If you see a chart of stock prices relative to company earnings, what you're seeing is the radical volatility of psychology relative reality. When things go well, as Morgan and I have been describing, and people feel strong and they feel encouraged and they feel that they'll prudently take advantage of the potential of the Future by amping up their portfolio, they take a very positive attitude toward the future, toward the use of leverage, toward the purchase of risky assets. At the same time, the financial institutions are feeling equally good about it. So they become willing to lend more to a given investor for a given purpose. So the leverage in portfolios goes up. As the good times roll on, the leverage is rewarded through magnified profits, and that causes the investor to do even more of it. And as stock prices rise, the investor buys more and with more and more borrowed money increasing the riskiness of the portfolio as the times become riskier. Then eventually something turns down, the companies don't do as well, the market sags, stock prices decline, the investor now starts to take magnified losses. He might get a margin call, or he might just liquidate and get out on his own and uses less and less leverage and sells stocks at lower and lower prices because they can't stand the pressure. They had overestimated their ability to live with risk, and their attitude towards leverage becomes more harsh at the same time that the banks become unwilling to provide leverage And in fact try to recall some of the leverage they put out in the past. So everything goes swimmingly on the way up and people take on more and more risk and people get depressed and things go terribly when things swing down until at the bottom, portfolios Tend to be less levered and to hold fewer assets even though they have become much cheaper. So it's a highly cyclical process, but it follows the pattern of most other things, especially in the financial world and especially when human nature is involved.
  Speaker 2
  Just said, it's so important to realize how inevitable these cycles are, that whenever you have a boom-bust cycle, it doesn't mean that people have lost their minds. It doesn't mean that we've all gone crazy. It doesn't even necessarily mean that regulators and politicians have made mistakes. They're completely inevitable. There was a great economist named Hyman Minsky, and he came up with this idea called the financial instability hypothesis. And to grossly simplify it, basically what he said to us, when there are no recessions, people get optimistic. When they get optimistic, they go into debt. When they go into debt, the economy is fragile. And when the economy is fragile, you have a recession. And inherent in that was a lack of recessions plants the seeds for the next recession. And that's why you're always going to have recessions. The same thing applies to the stock market, any asset class, that a lack of volatility is what plants the seeds for future volatility. In the stock market, if there was no volatility, people would very rationally bid valuations up. When valuations go up, they become fragile. When you become fragile, you get volatility. It's completely inevitable. I think that's important because this is what causes people to underestimate volatility, at least intuitively. They think, well, there will be a recession when people go crazy or when politicians screw up, whatever it might be. It's like, no, you don't need any of that. You don't need people to screw up. You can just have natural volatility in all asset classes based off of what Hyman Miski figured out 50 years ago. So that's why these things are completely inevitable. They don't require a car crash, so to speak, in the economy. It's just the natural tendency of what markets do.
  Speaker 1
  What Morgan just illustrated so eloquently is the cause and effect nature of cyclical events. I wrote a book a few years ago called Mastering the Market Cycle, and I said in there that people might think that a cycle consists of a series of events which typically follow in a given Progression. So you have A and then B happens, and then after a while C happens and sometimes D happens and then it goes on to E and that's followed by F. No. A happens. It causes B. B causes C. C causes D. And if you replay Morgan's description of the process through which the occurrence of a recession is ensured, you see this causality. And you make a big mistake if you think about cycles without thinking about causality. I think the great example is the boom in mortgages and especially subprime mortgages that led to the global financial crisis. Basically, to put it short, people looked at history. They said there's never been a nationwide wave of mortgage defaults. And so they engaged in practices that guaranteed there would be a nationwide wave of mortgage defaults. It's that simple. I think it's important too. There's an interesting thing here that's a great thing for the overall world. ([Time 0:15:12](https://share.snipd.com/snip/65fcd231-472b-49dd-a5b1-f3d1befa6adc))
    - **Note:** Economy very cyclical and interconnected that good times cause bad times. People take on more risk in a crisis.
- History Rhymes, But Does Not Repeat
  Summary:
  Investing successfully requires patience, diversification, and an understanding that historical contexts differ significantly over time, especially regarding interests rates.
  Reliance on past performance as a guide for future results can lead to disappointment due to changing economies and societal norms. While specific investment strategies from past decades may not be applicable today, the psychological behavior of investors during economic events tends to repeat.
  Historical analysis should thus focus on behavioral patterns rather than concrete events or outcomes.
  Recognizing that human reactions to market changes—such as recessions and bear markets—remain constant allows for a more grounded approach to investing.
  The ability to predict specific economic downturns is limited; however, understanding the overall human response can inform better investment decisions. In a rapidly evolving landscape, such as the rise of AI and shifts in interest rates and debt management, it is crucial to adapt strategies based on enduring behavioral trends rather than historical investment successes that are unlikely to repeat.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Two things I would add to what Howard just said. The first I've joked that the three most important investing skills are patience, diversification, and having your peak investing years aligned perfectly with a 40 year decline In interest rates. Those are the three things you need to do well over time. One thing I would add to this topic that I think is really important is that it becomes dangerous to use history as a perfect guide of the future. History by and large is the study of surprises. And the irony that people use the study of surprises to try to gain a map of the future causes a lot of disappointment. So it's common for people who have not experienced a rising interest rate environment to say, well, what happened in the 1970s, the last time this occurred? And they go back and say, oh, what did well? Gold did well, small caps did well, whatever it was. And they say, great, well, we do that now. And that's just not how the world works. Things adapt. It's an utterly different economy today than it was back then. Very different social standards, investing ideas, whatnot. So I think a lot of people stumble into problems when they just look back and say, well, what worked last time? And kind of like back test it from there. The world adapts in a way that doesn't allow you to do that. My solution to this is just going back historically and saying, how do people psychologically act during these events? That tends to be repeatable. The behaviors tend to be repeatable, even if the specific investing ideas are by and large not.
  Speaker 1
  This is what Mark Twain had in mind when he said, if in fact he said it, that history does not repeat, but it does rhyme. In other words, the events of history, the facts of history, the investments that benefited from declining interest rates, those things will not repeat. But the themes of history, and certainly, as Morgan says, human behavior will rhyme from cycle to cycle. So if you were a strict student of history and you believed that it could be extrapolated, you might go out and buy railroad stocks, which were great beneficiaries in the 1860s and 70s. But I dare say, you should say, what is the environment going to look like in the years ahead? How will investors react to that environment in the years ahead? What new investments should I be looking to to take advantage of it? Certainly not the ones that did well 150 years ago.
  Speaker 2
  My favorite quote here is from Voltaire, who says, history never repeats itself, but man always does. I think that's a great summary of investing history. The events never repeat, but the behaviors always do.
  Speaker 3
  I think this is so interesting to keep in mind right now because it does seem like we're at a time when it may be that some fundamental things in the economy could be shifting. We have AI, obviously we do have this new potential interest rate environment. You also have all of these geopolitical changes. And when people think about how much debt they can take on, how much risk they can take on, on the one hand, it seems like, okay, if everything's changing, how can anyone use anything from History to figure out how to move forward?
  Speaker 2
  But as both of you are saying, maybe there are these behavioral cycles, these behavioral shifts that people can look to. I think at the high level, you can say, I have no idea what's going to cause the next recession, or when it will occur. But I have a very good idea of how people respond to it, because that's really never changed. And same with bear markets and whatnot. I think the vast majority of attention in the financial world is put towards forecasting when these things are going to occur. The track record of that is very poor. I think it's just much better to have a good idea of what happens whenever they do occur, because that is something that we can learn from history. And you know that these behaviors have been happening for hundreds of years. Go back and look at how people were responding to bear markets in the 1800s and recessions in the 1800s. It's no different than it is today. ([Time 0:23:30](https://share.snipd.com/snip/59ea1363-3f7c-4b5f-a231-ff26a0fa4238))
    - **Note:** Don’t study events but psychological behaviors from those events. Human nature never changes. Be positioned for the crisis with a plan.
- Embrace Risk for Investment Success
  Summary:
  Investing successfully requires a willingness to embrace risk, as risk avoidance often leads to missed returns.
  Understanding that losses are an inherent part of investment allows for a more realistic approach to financial success. Accepting that declines in market value are inevitable, rather than unexpected risks, alters one's definition of risk.
  Investors should focus on managing risks, instead of avoiding them altogether, recognizing that patient endurance of volatility is key to long-term gains.
  The balance between losses and gains plays a crucial role in investment outcomes; successful investors tend to benefit from mispricing and the capability to weather market fluctuations.
  Just as life insurance companies account for inevitable factors like mortality, investors must accept that losses in certain investments are part of a broader strategy. By intelligently bearing risks and optimizing debt rather than maximizing it, investors can position themselves favorably in a volatile market.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 3
  We've been talking a lot about people taking on too much risk, taking on too much debt, underestimating risk, but I'm also thinking about the other side of it, which is the risk of not Taking enough risks. So I'd like you both to speak about that.
  Speaker 1
  Well, the memo before last was entitled the indispensable of risk. And the point is that risk avoidance usually results in return avoidance. Risk is the element that fuels gains. You make money as an investor by taking risk and having your decisions validated. As I say, it's risk management, not risk avoidance. In that memo, I said most people understand this intellectually, but human nature makes it hard for many to accept the idea that the willingness to live with some losses is an essential Ingredient in investment success. Now, this sounds like an oxymoron. How can losses be part of success? And it's not that we crave to lose money, but we have to understand that exposing yourself to the possibility of losses is an essential part in an investment plan designed to produce Success. And if you bear the risk of losses once in a while, you're going to have some losses. So it shouldn't come as a shock when you have some investments that turn out to be unsuccessful. And it doesn't mean you did a bad job. The question is, how many? What ratio to the winners? How big were the losers? How big were the winners? Warren Buffett lately has been attributing the bulk of his success. I think he says 12 ideas. Charlie Munger used to say four ideas and he would tell you what they were. But the point is you make a lot of investments. It's kind of like throwing bread on the waters. Some of them succeed as you hoped. Some of them will surprise you, others will disappoint and produce losses. But if you do a good job on average, that's what successful investing is all about.
  Speaker 2
  One thing I'd add here is just the definition of risk in general. If you live in Florida, then getting caught in a thunderstorm is not a risk. It's inevitable. It's going to happen. There's no question about it. And I think if you are an investor, then dealing with a 10th 20% decline in the S&P 500 is not a risk. It's an inevitability. It's going to happen. Maybe you don't know when or how long it's going to last, but it's going to happen. This is a definition of risk in your own personal life. Getting in a fatal car accident is a risk because it's not going to happen to 99.9% of people. So that really is a risk. But if you are an investor and your definition of risk is something that is guaranteed to happen to you, you have a faulty definition of risk. What you're dealing with is just run of the mill volatility. And back to what I said earlier, you get paid for two things in investing. One is mispricing, the other is the endurance of volatility. For the vast majority of investors, professional or otherwise, what going to be paid for over the long term is the endurance of volatility. So when you experience a decline, if you say, this is a risk, I didn't see this coming, somebody screwed up, I made a mistake, you're viewing it all wrong. What you are experiencing is the cost of admission over time. And your ability to put up with it is what you get paid for over the long run.
  Speaker 1
  And one of the stories I love to tell is that I started to manage high yield bonds for Citibank in 1978. And I was interviewed on one of the first cable shows, the Financial News Network, I think was called around 81. And the interviewer said, how can you invest in high yield bonds when you know some are going to default? And for some reason, the perfect answer popped into my head. I said, how can the life insurance companies, which are the most conservative companies in America, ensure people's lives when they know they're all going to die? And this goes back to what Morgan said a bit ago. The question is, are you taking risks you're aware of or risks you're unaware of? The life insurance company knows everybody's going to die. They can analyze their health individually, they can diversify their portfolios, but most importantly, they charge a rate for the insurance, which assumes that the deaths will occur And still produce a profit. That's exactly what I saw a high-yield bond investing as. We take credit risk, we diversify our portfolios, we study our borrowers, and we invest only when we think the extra yield we get, called the yield spread, is sufficiently compensatory For the risk we're taking. I call that the intelligent bearing of risk for profit. That is what you have to do. But to say, my job is to avoid risk, my job is to have no risk in my portfolio, that's really folly.
  Speaker 3
  So I think bringing it back to what we were talking about at the beginning of today's episode, it's really trying to put oneself in a position where one can endure the inevitable risk. And that goes back to the idea of optimizing levels of debt, not maximizing levels of debt. ([Time 0:27:42](https://share.snipd.com/snip/acfc440a-a40d-497a-b8ec-e964615c529c))
    - **Note:** You need to take risk to make money. How do you take intelegent risk. The market falling isn’t a risk it’s an inevitability. Car crash is a risk market sell off is an inevitability. Take risks you’re aware of. Don’t avoid risk. Optimize don’t maximize debt.
- Endurance Over Maximization
  Summary:
  Emphasizing the importance of enduring financial strategies, it is crucial to optimize, rather than maximize, levels of debt.
  Different individuals have unique risk tolerances, relevant to their circumstances and psychology. A debt-free position can provide psychological stability, particularly for those with family responsibilities.
  The key is to focus on sustaining average investment performance over long periods to yield exceptional returns, rather than chasing high returns that may be unsustainable.
  The example of Warren Buffett illustrates that a longer-term investment with a lower yield can be more valuable than a short-term, higher-yield option, reinforcing that a focus on endurance can clarify investment decisions that often confuse investors.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 3
  So I think bringing it back to what we were talking about at the beginning of today's episode, it's really trying to put oneself in a position where one can endure the inevitable risk. And that goes back to the idea of optimizing levels of debt, not maximizing levels of debt.
  Speaker 2
  I think it's different for everyone. I've talked about this for my own personal finance where the level of debt I have in my household finances is zero, not on the house, not on anything. And to me there's two reasons for that. One is maybe just psychology. I have two young kids and it makes me feel good to have that level of stability. But the other that I think is tactical is, as I mentioned, a million times before, I just want to maximize for endurance because I know that if I can be an average investor for an above average Period of time, it's going to lead to extraordinary returns. It's just pick the variable that you want to maximize for the vast majority of investors want to maximize for returns. That's the need your reaction of like, of course, that's what you should do. I want to earn the highest returns. I actually don't think that's the case for most investors. What you want are the best returns that you can sustain for the longest period of time. That's what you want. I heard the story recently, and this is a secondhand story that I'm paraphrasing. So if I get some of these details wrong, don't sue me. I think it was in 2002, the dotcom wreckage, and there were lots of bonds that were trading at huge discounts. And Amazon had a couple of bonds. I'm making these numbers up, but let's say Amazon had a 10 year bond that was yielding 12% and a five year bond that was yielding 15%, let's say. That shouldn't exist. You shouldn't have a longer term bond that yields less because there's a higher chance that the company can go bankrupt for the longer duration. But there was one big investor who was scooping up the longer dated bonds at a lower interest rate. And it turned out that that investor was Warren Buffett. And asked why that was the case. He said because earning 12% for 10 years is a much better opportunity than earning 15% for two years. So when you're maximizing for endurance and time, a lot of these investing questions that trip people up in the short term become much clearer.

  One that sticks out to me, Howard mentioned this early on at the start of the conversation, and I did as well. These topics that we're discussing today are literally kindergarten finance 101 topics, but they are the easiest to forget. I think a lot of times in the financial industry, where you can make a lot of money, it is a magnet for people who have very high IQs and have PhDs and are very analytically skilled. And those people tend to be the ones who are the most likely to forget the basics that matter most. Maybe it's similar to medicine, where you have a lot of people who are studying mRNA and like the most advanced topics. But so much of what matters in medicine is eat your vegetables, don't smoke, and get eight hours of sleep. And the people who have the biggest brains are the ones who are most likely to ignore that because it's not intellectually stimulating. So a lot of times in investing, I think Howard has been the master of this over the decades. The people who are the most successful are the ones who are smart enough to get it right, but also humble enough to pay attention to the basics that so many people ignore.

And in the bad times, people fixate on them and conclude that there will never be a good time again. And they fail, they depart from the fray. So it's all about balance, risk versus safety, prudence versus greed, using maybe some leverage, but only an amount you can endure financially and emotionally.

    - **Note:** Don’t over complicate things keep them simple. Simplicity over a long time horizon is the key to success. We want to make the world complicated but we shouldn’t we should really keep it as simple as possible.
