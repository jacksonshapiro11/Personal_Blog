  Let's see if I can summarize all my suggestions. Lay the base before you try to – you want to become a cognitively elite, lay the base with stuff like walking, dopamine stack bands, reading, and concentration requiring hobbies. Once you're sort of like used to that somewhat more heightened life of the mind, interval train your concentration, engage in dialectical reading, keep idea documents, become a connoisseur In at least one thing, and then put in place a digital diet. Do that for a season. Your cognitive experience of the world is going to be different. It's just – it's going to be – you're going to seem smarter to other people. You're going to seem smarter to you. You're going to see nuances you lost before. Your stress levels will probably be lower. Your ideas, your creativity is going to be higher. I think life would just be better. Not everyone has to do – not everyone has time or interest in becoming like a cognitive athlete but if you do that's the type of thing i believe you need to do now this is kind of what college Used to be i guess it kind of still is was like a four-year cognitive athlete training program yeah i say used to because someone ([Time 0:20:26](https://share.snipd.com/snip/85d5c788-ce42-40b0-b1a3-a3bab1c7b0ea))

  So first of all, I love the approach you're taking here. This is classic LCP. You have an ideal lifestyle vision in mind, and now you're working backwards from that vision to saying, how can I actually make this possible? So when you're working backwards from a lifestyle vision, the things that matter typically is going to fall into the categories of obstacles and opportunities. What are the obstacles in the way for me getting where I am right now to something closer to that ideal lifestyle? The opportunities are what can I leverage? What type of like unique setup? This could be like career capital or family connection or whatever. What opportunities do I have to leverage as well? So you want to systematically work at reducing or bypassing obstacles while taking advantage of everything that you have, all the opportunities you have as well. So that's probably the right thing to do here. In this analysis is you're seeing the particular types of jobs you have in the animation industry is not remote work friendly. And your lifestyle vision, when you work backwards from it, remote work really makes that work, right? Because if you can be in a lower cost of living place, you could be at home and growing food and be near family and maybe not need to work as many hours because where you're living is less Expensive. If instead of being near Burbank or Disney is, you're instead, you know, where you grew up in Indiana, it's going to be cheaper to live. Like remote work seems to be at the core of it. So there's a key obstacle here if your current job trajectory isn't making that possible. So now you know what you're doing. Oh, I am systematically exploring and looking for insight. It might not be obvious, but I'm looking for a moment of insight about how do I reduce that obstacle? That's probably going to come from leveraging the opportunity of the various skills you have and looking for adjacent applications so like sure maybe if i want to be in like feature Motion picture animation there's like three options they're all based in california and they're cutting back and there's not remote work options but maybe there's an adjacent step Here actually this graphic skills i have could be used maybe not in like feature film uh whatever um animation but it could be used in whatever uh ([Time 0:31:58](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ca202c2d-1068-4fc3-8100-4f77742c3785))
