### Highlights

- I phoned Mum from the airport in Geneva, telling her I was tired and would skip Edinburgh and fly home instead. She wasn’t having that. “This is your job now, Conor,” she said. “You can’t just not turn up because you’re tired.” I remembered my friend and one-time tennis partner Pat Briaud’s words: “Your parents don’t mess around.” I turned up and made the semi-final, losing a feisty two-and-a-half-hour match to Britain’s Jamie Baker. It was my 24th match in five weeks. Exhausted, I collected my prize money: $480, before 20% tax.
  *This is your job now, Conor.*
  There are three tiers in the hierarchy of men’s professional tennis. The ATP Tour is the sport’s top division, the preserve of the top 100 male tennis players in the world. The Challenger Tour is populated mainly by players ranked between 100 and 300 in the world. Below that is the Futures tour, tennis’s vast netherworld of more than 2,000 true prospects and hopeless dreamers.
  I wasn’t schlepping my way through the lower ranks of the professional tour for the money or the prestige, both of which were in short supply. I, like everyone else, was there to remove myself from the clutches of the lower tiers. The Futures tour sometimes felt like a circle of hell, but in practical terms it’s better understood as purgatory: a liminal space that exists only to be got out of as quickly as possible.

- In San Jose, Andre Agassi was the big name. I was sitting in the players’ lounge when I looked up to see him walk past, surrounded by a gaggle of tournament organisers. I felt a surge of adrenaline seeing him up close for the first time. Some things about him were familiar – his brisk walk, pigeon-toed stance and rounded shoulders, as though permanently setting himself to return serve. Some others were unfamiliar. I’d never noticed his vacant gaze before, which was presumably the product of a long-practised avoidance of eyes staring at him.
  “Can we get you anything, Andre?” the gaggle circling him asked earnestly. “Uh, sure, I’ll have some water,” he replied half-heartedly, even though he was standing a few paces from a fridge full of bottled water. He wanted to give them something to do. One of them was dispatched and quickly came back with a plastic glass full of chilled water. Andre took a small sip and put it down on the table beside him, the one I was sitting at. He didn’t pick it back up. After a few moments, Andre and his entourage moved on.
  I couldn’t stop staring at the glass of water he had left behind, and considering what it represented. I stared at the smudges left in the condensation by his fingers, and then watched the water marks slowly bleed out to the bottom of the glass. Agassi later wrote in his autobiography of how lonely he found tennis. I understood what he meant, of course – I found it lonely, too. But remembering the sight of him besieged by help in San Jose, I think I’d have preferred his kind of loneliness.
  All serious tennis players – from gods such as Agassi to college players like I was at the time – have to grapple with isolation. For people who are comfortable with it, pro tennis can be a refuge: they find it behind a hotel door, with headphones on in a far-flung airport and, above all, inside the white lines of the court. The downside is that the victories are often private, too. When you remove the headphones, there is probably no one around to talk to; and even if there is, you probably don’t speak the same language. We were a strange cohort: sharing courts, canteens and coaches around the world but remaining ultimately alone. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j80cqncrevbzypv6exrcm1sz))
    - **Note:** loneliness in tennis
- The greats in tennis often become known by their first names – Roger, Rafa, Serena – but the rest of us are known by a number, our world ranking. To a greater extent than in any other sport, world ranking determines who you play, where you play and how much money you make. Tennis players have a deep and lasting relationship with their highest ranking. (Mine was 129.)
  Your ranking determined your social status on tour. The guy ranked at number 90 in the world doesn’t get as warm a handshake from the Slam champion as the guy ranked at 20. The Williams sisters didn’t linger to have a chat with me when Serena and I were 16-year-olds training at the Bollettieri tennis academy in Florida, but a girl I hit with who was ranked 50 in the world did stop and talk. Where a player sits in the hierarchy determines how they act, and everyone knows it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j80cr5h12vx3yta5zhe9bf72))

    - **Note:** status in interactions. This is so interesting but obvious people don’t have finite time. Human nature needs hierarchy.
- At Futures level, worse than the uncertainty of today is that of tomorrow. You never know when you’re going to lose, and so you don’t know when you’ll need to fly off to the next event. My early years on tour were pre-smartphone, so you always knew where to find the players who’d lost that day: sweaty and still in their kit, they would be lined up to use the PC in the hotel lobby, booking flights home, or else on their way to the airport en route to their next event. Surviving on the Futures and Challenger tournaments isn’t just about being good at tennis. It’s about being able to cope with the strange bedfellows of regular boredom and constant uncertainty. Not many succeed. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j80d9hah2c5aqf8m417zzvwe))

    - **Note:** loneliness and uncertainty is the market of success and tolerating uncertainty. Growing through hardship to pursue your dream. Tolerating uncertainty well leads to success
- Ask for a practice hit at the Futures level and the response – with the player already looking past you – was often, “No, I already practised.” At the top Challengers and ATP events, the response would often be along the lines of, “No, I already have a hit scheduled for three, but I can do tomorrow at 10am?”
  Asking players to hit was awkward, but necessary. It’s impossible to start a match well without at least a 30-minute hit earlier in the day, preferably an hour or two beforehand. It’s not just a physical thing. I could go for a run to get a sweat on, but you need to feel the ball, to build up ball-striking rhythm, play practice points. When it’s 0-0 and you’re staring down a serve of up to 130mph, it’s too late to start warming up.
  Seeking a warm-up partner, I would have to approach players I had never met before, trying not to come across as too desperate. I once opened with, “I’m good, I promise” – admittedly sounding quite desperate. Failing that, I would write “Conor Niland + looking” when signing up for a practice court in the referee’s office and hope someone would write their name beside mine. When I travelled alone, I often went to bed worrying whether I’d find someone to warm me up ahead of the next day’s match. One huge advantage of travelling with a coach was that it allowed you to avoid that stress. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j80dah8jy2vp66etc9c69mj4))
    - **Note:** how hard it is to find partners and make friends
- My older sister Gina turned professional after she finished school. When she was 18, the Irish national broadcaster RTÉ made a TV documentary about her, in which she was filmed warming up for the final of her Futures event in Algeria by hitting a ball against a wall. By finals day, almost everyone had gone home, and evidently none of the camera crew hit it well enough. Cut to 15 years later in Switzerland. I’ve qualified for my first-ever pro circuit final and I’m warming up alone, hitting a ball against a wall.
  When I made the last eight of a Futures event in the UK in 2005, the only other player in the quarter-finals who lacked a warm-up partner was Jamie Baker, so it made sense that we’d hit together. But he told me he’d prefer to warm up with his 60-year-old coach, as he had been doing it all week. I was left as the odd one out. Andy Murray’s brother, Jamie, on site for a doubles match, came to my rescue and warmed me up after he finished his doubles warm-up preparations.
  I made virtually no lasting friendships on tour through my seven years, despite coming across hundreds of players my own age living the same life as my own. Those destined for greatness, the teenagers who join having won grand slams on the junior circuit, don’t hang around the Futures for long: they win four or five events and then jump right to the Challenger Tour in less than a year, often while still a junior. They are in the minority, however, and the Futures tour housed some eccentric souls. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j80dhfh12e9sxrytw7v8w0w7))
    - **Note:** traveling alone and not making friends this is a great microcosm for life
- The true unfortunates, though, were the ones who were talented enough to rationally hope to advance. These were people who grew up as the best tennis players in their country, but were stuck between 300 and 600 in the world, not quite contending for the Challenger Tour nor the qualifiers at grand slams, but winning just often enough to keep their tennis dream faintly alive. A Futures tournament referee in the US became infamous for his straight-talking to 28-year-old players: “C’mon man, what are you still doing here?” He was straying out of his lane, but his intentions were good. And he was usually right. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j80dr0jtrtdfvb5kxy3x5x15))
    - **Note:** the opioid of hope
- We eventually reached the city, and tried to settle into a rhythm as best we could over the next couple of days. I promptly lost in straight sets in the first round to my grizzled opponent from Japan with huge braces on his teeth and a bizarre two-handed forehand. A few months earlier, I’d been in California as one of the best college players in the US. Now, my lifestyle had gone backwards, but the standard of player had gone up. At least I lost efficiently enough to get the flight back from Bukhara to Tashkent. There was no worrying about baggage handlers here: we were told on the runway to carry all of our bags up the steps of the plane and throw them into a storage room at the back of the aircraft. We were waved off by an air traffic controller using only one hand, as he held his pet jack russell with the other. Once on the plane I tried to recline back into my seat, but found the hinge was broken and it didn’t budge. Several people spoke openly on their mobile phones as we took off. Another Challenger under my belt. Sum total of ranking points earned: zero. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j80dqfjx8a825726v868f4dp))
