### Highlights

- The power of simplicity simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. When rich produces a record he wants to do it in its purest form all wheat no chaffe. Founded def jam records and nyu in college. Saw the finished product in his mind then worked from there to get to the actually product like a carpenter. He didn’t invent things he discovered them.
  Rick Ruben would only take on projects he loved and he hated average music only focused on the cream of the crop. He doesn’t get out of bed for average and has seen it many times he only works with greatness. Didn’t sacrifice quality over anything.

    - **Note:** Rich was quality over everything and refused to do average projects only working with the best.
      He believed in the ruthless edit strip it down to the essence all wheat no chaffe simplicity is deep power.
      He saw the finished product and production by reduction sculptors vs painters.
- He’s obsessed with simplicity but you need to work hard to do it. To write 10 good songs you’ll need to write 50. If you fish every day you might not catch a fish on any day but you will catch a fish remain determined. You need to try things you need to try things many won’t work but with enough practice and determination you’ll find things that will work. 
  He made people believe in themselves. Johnny cash said he made him believe in himself again. 
  Was a minimalist always stripping things down to their essence. Focused on making his favorite music. 
  Wanted to do as much pre production time as possible to avoid long time in the studio. Practice before the big event.
- He was often a sounding board for successful people willing to listen and digest. When people do hard things they need guidance. Buffet and munger.
  Not listen to anyone be the audience and do what you love. Do what you believe in not what you think is going to work.
  He stayed away from drugs and alcohol and his parents were very supportive. Driving him to shows waiting until 1 am then driving him to school the next morning.

- Rich would go to clubs and hear one type of music that the people liked and the record companies would make something different record companies were top down while the music in the clubs was instant feedback bottom up. Rich founded def jam to make this music but realized that the labels made all the record money so he became a label. Meets Russell Simmons was a hip hop mogul in a small universe. He teamed up with Rick. Shared a love a hip hop and still made profits. So they made a record company so they would control the process. Because he put out that hit album that sold 100k copies and put his address on it he met ll cool j. Got 100+ demos picked his. Hip hop wasn’t an industry just people doing something they liked. Ruben mixed summons promoted synergy in business. They got 600k advance.

    - **Note:** Ruben noticed a difference in reality in the music industry from what was available and what the public wanted. He was doing the market research in the clubs and saw the next wave. He put a product out into society and this lead to him growing his business and meeting more people. He realized where in the supply chain value accrued and attacked that. He also got on the ground floor of an industry as it was being built and rode the wave.
- They made a movie about the founding story Simmons was always looking for innovative form of advertising. Featured his artists in the movie with run DMc and ll cool j. After this movie which is basically content marketing helps them get a larger advance from cbs.
  He had balls he got Aerosmith to collab with run dmc when he was a college student and they were rock stars. Willing to ask the crazy questions wanted to make things rough and raw. A handmade product for the masses.
  He would make something the best it could be then move on and not get hung up when it’s done it’s done. He worked ruthlessly toward greatness and once he released it he did it with pride devoid of regret. If it could be better it’s not done. All work is a diary entry your work 20 years ago was your best work at that time.
  The ruthless edit take 25 songs you need 10 pick the 5 you can’t live without then what could I add to these 5 to make it better not worse.

- Regret when you look back at your life at 20 years old with regret it’s one thing but when you do it at 75 it’s brutal.
