- Monetary Dominance vs. Fiscal Dominance
  Summary:
  The money system of a sovereign country is governed by both fiscal and monetary policies, which can be differentiated by activities such as quantitative easing or buying bonds (monetary) and government stimulus programs or congressional spending (fiscal).
  In the 1970s, inflation was mainly caused by bank lending, while the response to it was through high interest rates, showcasing monetary dominance. Conversely, in the 1940s during World War II, massive fiscal deficits funded by bonds purchased through monetary base expansion characterized fiscal dominance.
  The examples illustrate how money creation sources differ and the varying tools available to control inflation in each scenario, with today's Japan being a prime example of fiscal dominance with high government debt and deficit monetization by the central bank.

  So fiscal dominance, that is like a government. So both both fiscal and monetary, I guess, policy is what governs the money system of any sovereign country. Right. So we understand that there's these two pieces. And in order to identify like, which is which when we see things like quantitative easing or like buying buying of bonds or interest rate increases or decreases. All of the drone Powell fed type of activity, that's going to be more the monetary policy type controls. Whereas on the fiscal side, when we see see things like you mentioned, like COVID, the COVID stimulus or the PPP loans or even like more recently, the inflation reduction act kind of Like congressional. We are spending this amount on X program. That is more on the the fiscal side of things. Would you say that's accurate? What are some like examples in each? So that listeners can good good at identifying the differences between monetary and fiscal.
  Speaker 1
  Yes, that's accurate. I think I think we can make the example more clear by referring to time periods. And so for example, when people think of inflation, they often think of the 1970s, the 1970s was a very inflation environment. That was mostly inflation from bank lending. So there's really there's two main ways that new broad money enters circulation. One is fracture reserve bank lending. And then the other one is monetized fiscal deficits. So you can quantify the size of what's happening there. So in the 1970s, I mean, they were running deficits. But if you look at kind of the how much new bank loans are created each year, that's that was a larger number than the size of the fiscal deficits that year. And especially when you when you kind of look at that over and you say rolling five year period. And so basically more money is coming because banks are lending. And the reason that was happening, there's a bunch of reasons. But basically the baby boomers were entering their home buying years. So you had a big demographic surge. A lot of people kind of hitting their their period of peak credit formation. And back then houses were cheaper so people could buy homes earlier. They bought them often in their in their 20s or, you know, sometimes early 30s, but they could start buying homes on average. Earlier than people do today. So this big generation is coming into their home buying years, their family formation years is kind of peak credit formation. Banks are making a lot of loans. You have money supplies going up very quickly. And then you've ran into price inflation because you had that higher than normal rate of money creation at the same time as you had obviously constraints and oil supply. And we're also running some background deficits that weren't helping, even though they were they were a smaller force. And the way to get that under control was that Paul Volcker, the head of the Fed, raised industries to the highest level they've ever been in the United States. And the reason that was effective was because, you know, the federal government only had 30% debt to GDP. So there was not a lot of debt on the the public sector and there really wasn't even a ton of debt on the on the private sector. But he was able to raise rates super high. And what that did was that slowed down borrowers wanting to borrow money. You know, who wants to borrow money at double digits, especially if that's much higher than the inflation rate. So real real high nominal rates and real high rates compared to the, you know, kind of measures of inflation. And so that really slows down the ability and the desire for people to borrow money. And it slows down that rate of bank lending. It kind of pushed the economy into a credit contraction recession. But you kind of wash out some of that inflation from the system. You kind of reduced demand enough to allow supply to catch back up to it. And so that was that's an example of monetary dominance and action, both the cause of inflation and then the response to having that high inflation. Whereas another big inflationary appeared in the US was the 1940s. And people don't really think of that decade when they think of inflation, but that was roughly on average as inflationary as the 70s. But that was that was the last time we were in fiscal dominance. And so in the 40s, banks were not lending much at all. That was not a period of rapid bank lending. Instead, the obvious context was World War II. And so they had already gone through the Great Depression. So they already had the big private debt bubble pop and they started rotating that more to the public ledger. They kind of got stuck in this period stagnation. But then, you know, as populism grew around the world partially because of economic reasons, war broke out. And when it came to war, they did these massive fiscal deficits, the biggest deficits relative to GDP we've ever seen. They were even bigger than what happened in the 2020s. And, you know, a lot of that goes to fight in the war, but, you know, that's going to commodity development. That's going to manufacturing. When the GIS come home, you put them through college and technical school and subsidize their mortgage. And it's, you know, it's going to government spending program space. Exactly. Yeah. Really big, really big stimulus in various ways. And that, and it's a lot of that, the bonds they issued to fund all that because it's a tremendous amount of bonds. They were bought by the, you know, the Federal Reserve increasing their monetary base. Then they were bought by the commercial banking system on fraction reserve leverage. And so you had this huge spike in the money supply, but it was not because banks were lending. It was because these really big monetized fiscal deficits were plowing money into the system. And the Federal Reserve, they were basically captured by the Treasury. So they kept rates low despite the fact that inflation was very high because if they raise rates, it wasn't going to change the decision of Washington. You know, they're not going to not go fight this battle because of what the Fed's doing. They're not going to change any of that. And so it's not, it's an entirely different tool set around that. And so eventually after the war, they pivoted more toward austerity and they had a number of kind of things in their favor to grow out of that problem. But that's an example of fiscal dominance at its kind of its most extreme. It was a 70s was more so a monetary dominance. And today in emerging markets, you see often there is fiscal dominance happening. Probably the best, the clearest case of fiscal dominance today is Japan. So they have over 250% debt to GDP. You know, bank lending is not at a very high rate at all. Some of the lowest rates of bank lending in the world. Their money supply increase that is still fairly slow, but the increase that does happen is largely because the government's running deficits and then the central bank is helping To monetize those deficits. And so it higher interest rates are have a mixed success record of dealing with that because it's not like it's not like they're going to change their government spending much based On what the central bank does in the same way that the private sector responds. And so I think that's kind of a good baseline t... ([Time 0:12:38](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a222bc07-19a6-46a1-bfea-8e2c9c53b5a9))

- The Limitations of Monetary Policy in the Face of Fiscal Dominance
  Summary:
  Fiscal dominance can limit the effectiveness of monetary policy, as increasing interest rates may become ineffective in addressing inflation when the economy reaches a certain debt level.
  Pushing interest rates too high in an economy with significant debt can be likened to 'pushing on a string', where the impact on inflation is limited. The transition from monetary to fiscal dominance is gradual and depends on factors such as the level of public debt and country-specific policies.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Whereas any sort of big cash position they have in T bills or whatever else they're holding it in. That's paying them more every time the federal reserve raised interest rates. And so that's that's one of the key reasons why structurally fiscal dominance starts to take over and limit the options of monetary policy, because what we normally think of as what Central banks should do in the face of inflation is they should raise interest rates. But then after a certain point, you go to that looking glass where, you know, you're you're raising interest rates and it's only moderately effective because you're you're stimulating As much as you're pushing down. And if you go far enough, like if you get into Japan's case, you know, there's it's so lopsided at 250% that do GDP and almost no bank loans that industry increase increases would almost Certainly be somewhat stimulatory for inflation.
  Speaker 2
  I've heard people describe like monetary policy in that conditions like pushing on a string. It's just like you keep pushing and just nothing happens. Yeah.
  Speaker 1
  And it's just it that's that's kind of the transition you go through. And that's also why it's not a it's not 100% versus another, you know, zero percent. It's like as you as you kind of get more and more debt on the public ledger, there's no magical line where that starts to switch over to fiscal dominance. It pars. It depends on, you know, different countries have different policies for like what kind of mortgages they have. Right.

    - **Note:** Fiscal dominance is coming because monetary dominance is gone when debt to gdp is so high you devalue your currency when you raise rates because you need to print more of it to pay interest. Because the monetary policy doesn’t matter all that can make a difference is the government directing their spending and stimulus to different areas of the economy causing stimulus and growth. When fiscal deficits are greater than new bank loan creation and corporate bond issuance that’s physical dominance and higher debt to gdp. This is an overall devaluation of cash and the things that benefit are government backed not free market. Excess liquidity
