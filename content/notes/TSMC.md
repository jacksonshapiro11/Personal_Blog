### Highlights

- **Morris Chang's Path to TSMC**
  * Morris Chang, after a successful career at Texas Instruments (TI), aimed to become CEO but faced setbacks. 
  * Morris was going to be ceo but was passed over for a variety of reasons went from the star man and future ti out of a job with no clue what to do next. Thought his career was over. Forced to go back to Taiwan despite living in America most of his life and considering himself an American. 
  * Missing out on IBM's PC microprocessor project was a turning point, shifting industry dominance to Intel. 
  * Chang resigned from TI at 52, then from General Instrument after a year due to cultural mismatch. 
  * These setbacks seemingly ended his CEO aspirations, but unexpectedly led him to Taiwan and the founding of TSMC.

  So he was a TI guy and he left. And the culture at TI, as shown by Morris's experience, was not like Trader Estate, Silicon Valley, you leave. It was like, you're a company man. You stay at the company. So Motorola poached a whole bunch of Moss engineers from TI and it all kind of fell apart, culminating in the biggest huge loss. Now, this is really history turning on a knife point. In 1980, so Morris has already transitioned to consumer products. IBM puts out a secret RFP bid proposal for a secret project that they're working on. This is 1980 by a new group based out of Boca Raton, Florida. Do you know what I'm talking about, Ben? I have no idea. Some listeners might know what I'm talking about. This is the secret project. This is the RFP to be the microprocessor, the CPU for the secret project, the IBM PC.
  Ben Gilbert
  Ah, okay. That was out of Boca Raton?
  David Rosenthal
  Yeah, it was a secret project, like a Skunk Works division of IBM. Oh, wow. To build the PC, which is a big, you know, IBM was the mainframe company. They're like, we're going to build a personal computer. So, Skunk Works project. And TI, you know, a couple of years earlier under Morris would have been an obvious candidate. Remember, he had the relationship with IBM going all the way back. TI probably should have been the processor chosen. Right. Instead, of course, it was Intel. I think it was the 8088 that was chosen for that first one. Wow. Boy, did that set things in motion. Well, then the architecture standardizes on x86 and boom, there goes the whole next generation of computing away from TI over to Intel.
  Ben Gilbert
  The sort of family of IBM with Intel processors and eventually running Microsoft operating systems. And then all the IBM clones all running Intel processors. Okay, so this is really where... That is a major loss. In the highway of history, TI accidentally took the off-ramp there.
  David Rosenthal
  They did. Now, okay, is that Morse's fault? Is that not Morse? I don't know. Certainly, the culture at TI was, we rotate you around, you're going to fix consumer. He didn't fix consumer, but couldn't. And then this, the semiconductor powerhouse took an off-ramp, as you say. All that, his career at TI is basically over. So he was the rising star. Everybody thought he was going to be the next CEO. And at age 52 in 1983, after he stays a couple of years being the head of whatever.
  Ben Gilbert
  He was something staff.
  David Rosenthal
  Yeah, yeah. He just resigns. And he's like, wow, well, I guess this is it. My career at TI, 30 years, done. He's still regarded super highly in the industry, though, in the semiconductor industry. So people start calling him with opportunities. And he wants to be a CEO. I mean, that's what's on his mind. He wanted to be CEO of TI. That didn't happen. He wants to be CEO. But he whittles it down to two opportunities he's going to consider. One is to go to a competitor called General Instrument, which people may have heard of another one of these old chip companies. It was based in New York and Manhattan in New York City, actually, to go be their COO, the number two there, with an understanding that like, hey, if things go well in a couple of years, You'll replace the CEO, become the CEO there, or to become a venture capitalist. Really? Yeah. So he was weighing the two. I don't know where or how. I couldn't find that out but he was weighing these two opportunities the vc idea is going to come back up in a big way in a second but obviously he goes with general instruments gi a his dream Is to be ceo b he's got this chip on his shoulder from the way ti ended so yep great so he goes off to new york you know he leaves te lives in Manhattan. Things are going to work out at GI. The thing though is GI had a very different culture than TI. You know, TI was this research, build, develop technology, push the ball forward. GI is this New York based, they were almost like at the time, like a proto tech private equity firm. Their strategy was they just acquired lots of different semiconductor businesses, either independent companies or divisions from other companies. And try and integrate them. No, they would acquire them. They would get these business units into good shape and then they'd sell them again. Oh, really? Yeah, they were like, literally, they were like a financial engineering firm, basically. Definitely not Morris's cup of tea. So he only stays there a year. It's clear that's not a good fit. So he resigns again. So within less than 18 months, he's had two major setbacks. Basically, you know, his dream is over. Like here's the quote from him. He says, after these two setbacks at TI and GI, I did not think that my aspiration to be the CEO of a major US company was in the cards. Well, turns out he was right. He was not going to be the CEO of a major US company. So how do we go from this dude in his mid-50s, former rising star, now washed up, from that to he's in Taiwan, he's CEO of TSMC. I don't think you could ever script this out. I think this is probably the most unique. Every founding story is unique, but I think this might be the most unique founding story we've had on Acquired so far. So back when Morris was at TI, when he was running the semiconductor business there, he went over to Taiwan a couple times to talk about building a manufacturing plant there. TI would own and build the manufacturing plant, but outsource to Taiwan. Not like a TSMC style business, like it was a TI plant there. Anyway, he had no connection to Taiwan. Remember, he's Chinese. He's not from Taiwan. People are like, oh, Morris, you went back to Taiwan. He didn't go back to Taiwan. ([TimeÂ 0:40:08](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c4cf2473-e5c2-4154-b3e2-254044e4ae7e))
- **TSMC's Rise to Dominance**
  * Initially, TSMC relied on unwanted, unprofitable chip manufacturing from established companies (IDMs).
  * Morris Chang strategically positioned TSMC to support emerging fabless companies, forseeing their growth.
  * This created a flywheel effect: fabless growth fueled TSMC's revenue, allowing them to invest in advanced tech and attract more clients.
  * TSMC evolved from lagging behind to leading the industry, outpacing competitors in process technology and market share.
  * Over time, the number of companies at the leading edge of process technology dwindled, with TSMC emerging as a dominant player alongside Samsung.
  * Grew through the small players

  Okay, so back to TSMC. The short-term market is Morris basically begs all of his old colleagues in the US and European and Japanese, semiconductor industries to just give the dregs to TSMC. And it really was the dregs. So here's Morris on what this was. The IDMs would let us manufacture their wafers only when they didn't have capacity or when they didn't want to manufacture the stuff themselves anymore. Now, when they didn't have the capacity and asked us to do the manufacturing, then as soon as they got the capacity, they would stop giving us orders. So it wasn't a stable market.
  Ben Gilbert
  So it wasn't actually a thing they wanted to outsource. They were just using them just like they didn't have the capacity, so they needed some extra excess space.
  David Rosenthal
  But then when they got the capacity online, they took it away. Right. And then the chips that they gave us that they didn't want to make anymore, well, the reason they didn't want to make it was it was losing money. So they basically were just transferring their losses on producing these chips to TSS. So how did they get out of this? So Mars continues, the conventional conclusion at the time was that there was no market. That's why the Pure Play Foundry idea was so poorly thought of. What very few people saw, and I can't tell you that I saw was the rise of the fabless industry i only hoped for it and then as you said but i had better reasons for hoping for it than the people At intel at ti and motorola because i was now standing outside when i was at ti in general instrument i saw a lot of these ic designers wanting to leave start their own businesses and the Constraint was setting up their own fabs so like, yes, he saw that at TIA, but remember, he had been considering becoming a VC instead of going over to E-Tree. So this is the ultimate end around. He becomes essentially like the world's best semiconductor VC. He takes an index out on the whole future innovation and entrepreneurship market in semiconductors by becoming the platform that they're going to build on instead of going and investing In them. He enables all of it. He's like the Y Combinator of semiconductors. Right.
  Ben Gilbert
  Or in many ways, the Tencent. Tencent, of course, also does direct investing. But the idea that you could get distribution through WeChat, it's kind of like it's not distribution, but it is manufacturing. There is a thing that you have to raise 10 to 20% of the capital that you otherwise would have needed to raise if TSMC exists. Yep.
  David Rosenthal
  And just like Don Valentine, you know, kind of when he left to go join VC a generation earlier, again, it's not VC, it's TSMC building the platform. But Morris is a hero. So all these engineers, they all look up to him. And he knows a lot of them personally, the ones he doesn't know, like who's not going to take a meeting with Morris Chang, right? He almost ran TI. Totally. Like he did all this amazing stuff.
  Ben Gilbert
  It's interesting because it's like with the incumbents, of course, because they had it in their DNA to be a manufacturer, of course they wanted to take the most profitable things and Manufacture them in-house. But if you actually are betting on all these startups that will never develop DNA to be their own manufacturer, they never want to take that back.
  David Rosenthal
  Yeah. And so Morris is now going out and evangelizing and he's like, all these great designers, like, we're an option for you now. Like, you want to leave, you want to start your own company. You don't need a fab. We'll be your fab. You know, it takes a couple years. For a couple years, TSMC has to survive on the dregs from the IDMs, the big guys. But after a couple years, these startups get going. Little companies like Qualcomm, Broadcom, Marvell, NVIDIA, these are all started with TSMC.
  Ben Gilbert
  NVIDIA was started in 1993, only ever raised $20 million. $20 million. And never opened their own fab.
  David Rosenthal
  I believe 100% with TSMC. Wow. Well, maybe they have other foundries too, but the vast majority of their business, Jensen talks about this, Jensen Huang. It took him actually a little while to get on Morris's radar. But once he did, the vast majority of NVIDIA's chips, TSMC makes them. And NVIDIA is what, like a $350, $400 billion market cap company now? It's wild. And only raised $20 million. It's like the AWS for chip companies. Never would have been possible before. Nope. So this is what's super cool. I don't think Morris saw this. This even exceeds his wildest dreams. He was hoping for this fabulous market to take off, but this creates this insane flywheel for TSMC. So the fabulous market starts to grow, which they're seeding and enabling it. As that happens, TSMC's revenue grows.
  Ben Gilbert
  And because they have 50% gross margins and 40% operating margins, they can take that profit and buy more advanced machinery.
  David Rosenthal
  Build more fabs. And advance the level of their technology. Remember, they were starting from behind on technology. Within about 10 years, they catch up. And then they start to exceed everybody else. So as they push manufacturing process technology forward, they're manufacturing better chips with smaller process lengths. They're enabling their customers, which are the Fabless companies, to get better and better performance. As they get better performance, the Fabless companies can address more of the market and more use cases. So their existing customers get bigger and new fileless customers start, which gives them more revenue, which repeats the whole cycle. And it goes slowly, like any flywheel. It takes a lot of effort and a lot of time to start turning it. But fast forward to now. So in the early 2000s, when TSMC finally caught up to the bleeding edge level of technology with other semiconductor companies, there were 22 companies that were at the leading edge. I think it was like, I don't know, let's call it 150 nanometer process or something like that at that point in time. 22 and TSMC finally broke into the pack. They were one of the 22. By the late 2000s, it had gone from 22 down to 14 that were at the leading edge. By the mid-2010s, there are six.
  Ben Gilbert
  It's basically Samsung and TSMC, right?
  David Rosenthal
  Today, there are two. Five nanometer process is the current leading edge. Only TSMC and Samsung. Intel has been trying to get there, but they haven't been able to. They've fallen behind. And the next process is going to be three nanometers. ([TimeÂ 1:13:54](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a37b5c46-b56b-4040-b040-4b9ab3ec180c))
