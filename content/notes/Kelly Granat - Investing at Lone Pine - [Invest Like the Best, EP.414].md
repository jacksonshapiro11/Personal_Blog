  Maybe just like, like bullet lists, like enumerate the things you seeing the winners of those pair wise examples, you just gave doing versus the losers, because in some of those categories, Like some airline, you know, some aircraft manufacturers or something, it's not like they, you know, they're pivoting to some random, like they're still making airplanes, Uber's Still driving people around, Lyft is too. So, so what is, what are, yeah, list those things. Like what are the winners doing in a, in a real cost of capital environment that the losers aren't?

  So I think it's, it's a bunch of things. Number one, there's really clear strategy in terms of what are we focused on, right? I think so many companies have eight different initiatives that are simultaneous, and there's a lack of understanding when you talk to people inside of a company of what actually matters. What are we driving towards, right? That's one. Two, there's a culture of accountability and measurement, right? Some companies have, it seems so obvious, right? Like people are bonused off of a certain thing. They, they do, you know, forward looking plans and budgets every year and they hit them or they don't. But there's some companies that are religious about, you know, having those be thoughtful exercises and accountable exercises and ones that are not right. And I think that shows through a lot. Three is companies who treat their consumers well, whether that's a B2B enterprise, a B2C enterprise, is when you talk to customers, and we do this all the time as part of our research, You hear how they are treated, and it is different. There's someone for them to pick up the phone and call. Their needs are being met. They don't feel like they're being aggressively raised, like their price is not being used as a weapon against them. They're not, they're being serviced. It's just different. There's, again, back to accountability and sort of a level of operating standard that is the expectation of how things are done. I think the other thing is there's a long-term orientation that I think some companies lose their way around, particularly when you have a lot of turnover and the amount back to people And you have a lot of turnover, incentives get set, whether that's tied to a stock price or the metrics that drive compensation and people's incentives are not aligned, right? And that doesn't promote long-term strategic thinking or orientation that filters down to the culture. So now people are cutting corners. They're trying to make numbers, make budget. That's a very different way to live as a company than it is around, we may miss a quarter, but this is the right investment to make, right? And so companies that I think do a good job of balancing short and long term, one, and two, are able to communicate to the market, you know, a consistent level of execution, right? We joke a lot internally that, and I say this a lot to management teams, every time you open your mouth to report your quarter, your stocks up or down 20%. What that tells me is, you are not doing a good job communicating your business. You don't have good visibility around your business because you are surprising the market every time you speak, good and bad. That's not like multiple enhancing for your company over time, right? And so that comes from how the internals of how a business is run. What are the incentives? What are the metrics? What's the culture? What's the retention? All of these things, I think, are such important glue that distinguish the better executors from the poor executors.
