### Highlights

- Episode AI notes
  1. Conscientiousness in learning has become more crucial with the availability of online resources like Khan Academy. Design and UI modifications can replicate traditional motivators to enhance conscientious learning.
  2. Engaging in deep cognitive work can sometimes impede metacognition in education psychology, making it challenging to plan, regulate, and evaluate learning progress.
  3. In the startup world, there is a balance between building ideas deeply and rapid prototyping. While testing ideas quickly is important, focusing solely on MVPs may hinder the development of strong ideas. Contemplation and deep thinking are essential for refining concepts before scaling.
  4. Creating prototypes as expressions of ideas rather than scalable solutions upfront is emphasized. Rushing to create generalized platforms without focusing on specific instances can lead to ineffective outcomes.

- Enhancing Conscientiousness Through Online Learning
  Summary:
  The availability of online resources like Khan Academy has increased the importance of conscientiousness in learning.
  To enhance conscientiousness, design and UI modifications can emulate traditional motivators like in-person deadlines and peer interaction. In education psychology, it is noted that engaging in deep cognitive work can hinder metacognition, making it hard to plan, regulate, and evaluate learning progress.

  Okay, so a brighter question is now that we have all these online resources, some of which you have helped develop Khan Academy and elsewhere, it seems that the value of conscientiousness As a trait has dramatically increased. If you can motivate yourself to learn these things, the world is out there for you to absorb. What are the sort of design or UI or even content modifications that can be made to give you a conscientiousness boost, where in the past, you have a professor, you have peers, you have In-person deadlines that motivate you, is there something equivalent to a pen and paper, how that boosts your mathematical IQ for conscientiousness?
  Speaker 1
  Right, so one enduring result in education psychology is that when you're doing a lot of cognition, metacognition is difficult. So what I mean by that is like when you're thinking really hard about the stuff on the page, it's very difficult for you to like plan, regulate yourself, figure out what the best next action To do, is reflect and evaluate whether you're understanding things, all the stuff that we're talking about, ([Time 0:08:26](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0e4e9dc3-56b6-40df-98d6-65fc769cc7a3))

    - **Note:** When you’re doing a lot of cognition meta cognition is hard. Reading with questions of a syllablus from a college course can guide meta cognition. However overtime you rely on that guidance less and take more agency over your knowledge. Just reading doesn’t help you learn as much as relevant conversations that stretch your knowledge in an area or application of it like doing or writing. Swanson linking. Active learning is how you learn. Programming is good because you feel a sense of constant forward progress not existential never moving and that progress prompts success. People hate and deeply struggle with intractable problems and love to be pushed at the edge of flow. This is really just flow.
      Meta cognition is about learning and then digesting through review and synthesis. Find work that is flow.
- Building Ideas vs. Rapid Prototyping: Balancing Theory and Action
  Summary:
  The speaker reflects on the balance between building ideas deeply and rapid prototyping in the startup world.
  They highlight that while it's essential to test ideas quickly, focusing solely on MVPs can hinder the development of strong ideas. They emphasize the importance of contemplation and deep thinking to refine concepts before scaling.
  The speaker shares a personal experience where rushing to create a generalized platform instead of focusing on specific instances led to ineffective outcomes.
  They stress the significance of creating prototypes as expressions of ideas rather than scalable solutions upfront, urging for a thoughtful approach prior to scaling.

  There's a amount that feels kind of dutiful and unpleasant. As a researcher, who is in these sort of Silicon Valley circles, what is your opinion on the startup advice? Do things fast, fail fast, get to users immediately with an MVP as somebody who is making products, but is also in a sort of in a different mode than a typical startup kind of making products. How do you think about advice like that?
  Speaker 1
  I have complicated feelings about this. I need different advice on different days, and of course, different people need different advice on different days. But when I was getting into this kind of work, that kind of advice led me to do, practically speaking, is to not think all that deeply about the ideas I was exploring, and to look to basically An idea would come up, and I'd think like, oh, I can try that. And then I would try that. And then I'd learn something, and then I'd repeat. And there wasn't this sense of building a theory of what the problem is and what it would mean to solve it. Instead, it was just a theory of action. Like a theory of action is opposed to a theory of change is if you imagine you're at some point, your current position, and eventually you want to get to some goal state. A theory of action is you look around you and you say, well, what can I do? What can I build? What do I see as possible? And the theory of change is to look at the endpoint and try to work backwards. Now, the metaphor is imperfect because in research, you actually usually don't exactly know what the endpoint is. And you certainly don't know how to work backwards. But I guess what I'm saying is that following that advice, historically, often has led me to try things that were straightforward. I think the most powerful design work has ideas in it. What makes a nonlinear text editor, that is like the text editors that we all know and love. So powerful is this observation that writing is a nonlinear process, but writing with a pen linearizes it. And many, many other observations like that, and on the nature of what it means to have a thinking environment is how we got that particular interface. Likewise, the way that we got powerful programming environments, insofar as we have them, is by people thinking very hard about what it means to specify a system and coming up with new Primitives that express those ideas. I think the most powerful interfaces are often the expression of new ideas or new primitives that capture new ways of doing new kinds of objects that can be manipulated in Photoshop, For instance. You can manipulate a photo by means of a construct called a layer. This is a very strange idea. It has some precedent in dark rooms where you could potentially have sheets of film, I don't mean the negatives, sheets of gels that you could potentially put over the lights to affect The exposure and to make there be more exposure here and less there. But in Photoshop, they're non-destructive and they're continuously manipulable. And the layer is a new primitive that is introduced into the activity of photo editing. And it utterly changed what you could do in photo editing. So I guess what I'm saying in a very long-winded and confused way is that I think it's difficult to have ideas by means of building an MVP very rapidly. Now, if you have an idea that you think is interesting, it is good to test it rapidly. And so part of why I'm confused is in my response here is that it's good advice once you have something worth testing. It's just that for me adopting that mindset, and I've lived in it for so long, that it's very ingrained to me, it makes me not sit in stillness and in confusion and in contemplation with The ideas long enough for them to be good. I mean, very concretely. So Michael Nielsen and I made this quantum country thing. When I was trying to think about what to do next, the most obvious or natural idea was like, well, what if we just tried that with lots of other things? And that idea occurred to me and the pandemic had just struck. So I was feeling a little timid, I guess, creatively or emotionally. I wanted something that felt kind of safe. And I knew that I could do that. Like, okay, I can build a platform that like generalizes this thing that we did for this textbook. So I did. And I did it relatively quickly. I did it in a few months. And that wasn't the right thing to do. It wasn't really the right question to be asking. The idea wasn't that strong. It wasn't the right way to test it. Like building this highly general version of it. I would have been better building more one-offs rather than like a self-serve thing that anyone could use. And this comes down to like the difference in aim. Like, I'm not trying to build some kind of scalable thing for the world at this moment. I'm trying to build the idea. The prototype is an expression of the idea. And once it arrives at a good place, then maybe there can be some scalable solution. But it's not necessarily at that place. And until it's at that place, there's like a lot of thinking and sketching that goes along with the building and prototyping. I think part of my confusion here is that often I still need to hear this advice. Like often I will just time myself in knots in theory land. And like what I really need to do is to have a friend sit me down and say like, is there a piece of this that you can carve off and like build next week?
  Speaker 2
  And so you're hearing a lot of tension. Interesting. And so what was the consequence of shipping orbit out, I guess, before it felt ready to scale?
  Speaker 1
  I mean, I learned some things. It was fine. Like, it taught me a lot about where that particular format succeeds and fails in other venues. It was just not a very effective way to find those things out. I built this like very general. It was an MVP in the sense that it has very few features. And it's very simple. But it was highly general. I mean, it's like, it's a deployed thing that has infrastructure and has accounts. It has like all this stuff that you do when you're building like a real thing. And that's very different from like, well, let me like work with this one author and like see if I can make it work with this one other book that's very different from quantum country to Form like a specific question or specific theory about like, well, it worked for this text. Like, what's the next kind of text that would be good to test flip? ([Time 1:42:54](https://share.snipd.com/snip/cc036a73-1b35-4405-ac9b-f3bb6be6274d))
