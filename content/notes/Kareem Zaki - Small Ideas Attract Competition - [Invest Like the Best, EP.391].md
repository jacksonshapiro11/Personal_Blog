### Highlights

- Invest Wisely, Impact Lastingly
  Summary:
  The distinction between category-defining companies and their peers lies in founders who possess a bold vision and an ability to execute it meticulously.
  Founders should not only challenge existing paradigms but also present concrete plans for realizing their ambitions. Successful examples, like SpaceX and Formation Bio, illustrate how clear steps and systematic planning can transform visionary ideas into reality.
  A critical characteristic of disruptive founders is their 'unreasonableness' in pursuit of excellence; they demonstrate relentless commitment to delivering unprecedented value and simplicity, as seen with companies like Stripe and Ramp.
  Moreover, identifying market momentum is essential; high velocity in emerging markets can indicate significant growth potential.
  Startups must seek out change and disruption in traditional markets to overcome their inherent disadvantages, as historical narratives reveal that established players often excel in their niche. Ultimately, focusing on market dynamics and a founder's capacity to innovate and challenge the status quo is key to recognizing transformative investments.

  I wanna talk a lot about this line that separates the top 100 or two companies, the category definers from whatever that next group. Those are, maybe there's some great or very good companies in that next category, but it seems like being able to be on one side or the other, that line is the game that you're playing. So maybe break down for us in as many ways as you can, what category defining actually means, because yeah, of course I want to be in those ones, but the pursuit of that, that you've honed Over a long time is pretty singular here. So just define that for us in a whole bunch of ways.
  Speaker 1
  I don't think you can talk about these great investments without talking about the founders. They're the heroes of the story. They're the ones that create and push boundaries and push farther than our imagination. And so really comes with one, does the founder have a big vision to start? Like this idea that small ideas have lots of competition. When a founder comes in and lays to you a big vision, just rewires the way you used to think about the world, it really hits you. It feels fresh. It feels different because you see lots of pitches that look similar, that play out. I think a couple of years ago, famously, we saw so many SaaS companies being pitched just across the board, every vertical. That's not an insult to the category, but I think there was a moment of time where that just felt so easy that we just saw so much of it. And so the first is a founder who's willing to zoom out, rewire your way of how you're going to think about the world, but also can get into the details and connect the dots of what that's Going to look like. And a big vision without a plan, it's just a fantasy. And so famous example, SpaceX. We want to go to Mars. Amazing. Well, you're starting to see how all those steps have been planned out over two decades of first being able to launch into orbit. And now we have Starlink and all the things that they're building on top of that. We have another company in our portfolio, Formation Bio. They're a full stack pharma company. We invested with them in the early days. But even then, when they were just a patient recruitment company, they laid out these steps to be a site manager, to be a CRO, to bring in therapeutic assets that they're going to run by Themselves. OK, we're going to commercialize it. And so $600 million later, they're building along that journey. But the seeds were there day one and there were the clear steps to go do that. I also think it needs founders too. I don't know what the exact word is, but they almost have an unreasonableness, like a mutation in them that makes them uncompromising around some dimension that you wouldn't necessarily Expect, but makes the company really special. For Stripe and Patrick and John Collison, I mean, it's just a push to simplicity. How do you take something so complex and arcane as payments, make it as simple as possible for developers. Ramp, we've been talking about, but the velocity and just the speed to kind of push. We're going to be uncompromising about responding to customer needs. I saw them post recently, they responded from a customer request to a new product feature in five hours. I mean, that's just where there's being relentless and uncompromising about doing that. I mean, that even scales outside of tech Costco, just unreasonable at giving value back to the customer. I love that they make fun of the CEO there for refusing to change the price of the hot dog and the soda. Because I think it's just so emblematic of what they're delivering to the customer. And we're going to be uncompromising about that, even though we know we're probably losing money on this hot dog and soda for $1.50 or whatever it is today. I love that. And so we see that in a lot of our companies. Actually, a fun anecdote about Robinhood. When we invested, they were only an equity platform. I had this meeting to talk about all the other things that they were going to launch. And one of the things we had on the page was, well, there's all these robo-advisors that seem to be getting traction. You should just bundle that in to the product. And the reaction was interesting because they were like, no, if we're going to do something, it's got to shock the consumer. And that was just so core to their DNA, these really frictionless, amazing value products. When they first launched, obviously, they shocked the consumer. It's $0 trading. No one could believe it. Everyone's like, how are they going to make money? And obviously, they had a plan, and they delivered on that. And it persists to the company today where they launch a credit card and it's 3% cash back and no one can believe it. And those are some of the unreasonableness that these founders bring. I think you can have it across one or two dimensions. If you have too many mutations, you become an alien and no one knows how to work with you. But we usually see some of that really shine through. And then to the separate point on market, I think there's a couple things that really show up as we look at categories. Back to this point that no company is big enough to create its own wave, we really need to see change happening in a market. And ideally, it's not a ripple, it's going to be a tidal wave, especially when it's a new market that we haven't seen before. It's hard to tell for sure. But we're really looking for obviously one, scale of vision, some things just hit you as big, some feel small. But then you're also looking for the velocity of the market in those early moments to tell you how long it's going to run. A couple of years ago, when we're looking at AI, obviously, the market was small, but you just saw the pull. And obviously, it wasn't hard to imagine how all of work wasn't going to change this way. And so we're not going to get the forecast in 2030, right. But you just look at the pull of the market, and you can imagine it being very large. The famous example of Uber where everyone undersized the market, because again, these new markets are hard to predict. But if you looked at Uber, it was growing insanely fast. So this idea that it was going to be capped by whatever it was, a billion dollar taxi market made no sense. Something growing that fast isn't going to be so constrained. And then if you zoomed out a bit, if you look at tangential markets, well, transportation is a massive market. And so we look at it, is there speed in the market? And is there obvious tangential areas of spend that could be represented in what's happening? And then some categories I think are a little easier to define and think about, which are these old categories that are going to be turned over. Financial services. Well, we can look at the banking sector. We can look at the brokerage sector. We can look at the credit card sector and get a thought about that. Or the healthcare market, where obviously we can look at where all the spend's going. I just think what's ... ([Time 0:23:39](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d41770eb-efa1-4d6d-93e4-5d13641bbc2c))
    - **Note:** Small ideas have a lot of competition but big ideas have very little. Be very fucking ambitious. Then you need a plan. We need to have the clear steps to get to the place where you are ever present even if that isn’t today. Have a couple core values and be clear and live them without compromising. Be unreasonable and shock the market. No company is big enough to create their own wave. Finding the change in the market.
- Embrace Big Challenges for Great Rewards
  Summary:
  The post-COVID landscape prompts a reevaluation of meaningful work, driving individuals to pursue projects that align with their values and hold long-term pride.
  High-impact problems often attract exceptional talent and can lead to substantial financial success. Companies pursuing ambitious goals, such as SpaceX and OpenAI, often experience less competition and can capture significant market value.
  The rise in interest and investment towards these visionary endeavors highlights a shift away from traditional sectors like Software as a Service (SaaS).
  It's becoming evident that tackling complex challenges, which once seemed daunting, can transform into remarkable opportunities.
  Amid a market brimming with potential category-defining companies, the key to investment success lies in access to these ventures and gaining insights before they reach mainstream recognition.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And we're coming out of the lead up to COVID and the rise up of all these tech companies and the ease of capital that went around. And now people, I think, are reflecting, be like, what do I want to work on? What's meaningful? What do I want to talk about with my families? What am I going to feel proud about in 10 years? And I think the great thing about that is usually also those align with great financial outcomes because you end up banding together a really talented team. Again, these big problems sometimes seem scary, but I actually think it's probably easier to go build because you end up attracting way better talent. I'm glad that the market's catching up now that capital is actually going to these great ideas instead of being crowded out by SaaS. Also, when you're working on these things, there's less competition. And so to the extent you're able to succeed in what you want to do, you're in a position to go capture that value, whether because you're the only person. You know, SpaceX famously, they don't really have competition as today. I know some people are inspired now is what they've seen with SpaceX, but they were building for two decades. No one was really paying attention to them. What it seemed like they're doing is crazy. And now they've built almost an insurmountable lead in our view to go do that. And I think more companies are starting to think like that, like an Andrel, like an OpenAI, companies that have a long-term vision, they're going after these crazy problems, which The first couple of years, people are like, no way you could sell defense to the government, or no way you can achieve AGI. That just seems crazy and a fantasy in 2050, not 2030. And then these companies kind of quietly build as Open has done since being founded in 2015. And then they have these light bulb moments, and then everyone's playing catch up. And so that's exciting to us. And it's something that we love to lean in. We love that more founders are doing. It's been part of our DNA from the beginning, I think, being based in New York. We were backing some of these more service capital intensive businesses, whether it was Josh starting Oscar, or us starting a PBM and right way to go after the big three PBMs that control 80% of the market and have 200 billion of enterprise value, or backing a lot of the fintech companies that you had to have a balance sheet or you're regulated like a Robinhood or a firm Or a new bank. And so those things were scary to people. And we kind of leaned into it and we've seen how that's played out. And I'm just excited that more and more of the market's going there. And we're realizing that a hard thing, a capital thing might actually not be a bug, but a feature of a great opportunity.
  Speaker 2
  There's this interesting challenge. Let's say there's 100, just to make a round number, category-defining companies out there in private markets right now. If you went and asked a bunch of smart investors, what are the hundred? There'd be a decent amount of overlap for sure. At some point, no one would say SpaceX is not a category defining company or Stripe or all these names that you've mentioned, honestly. And obviously, at some point they weren't, and then they became one. And of course you want to be in there earlier, but you continue to invest as they continue to dominate. So what is it that creates the return opportunity in your opinion? Is it access? Because access is scarce to these companies. They only raise so much money from so many investors. Is it better understanding and knowledge? Do markets under price category defining this? Where does the alpha remain before it tips into beta for that group of 100? I think it's two things. One is what you called out. ([Time 0:39:09](https://share.snipd.com/snip/77074bbe-9961-474f-9068-b1a406a3eada))
    - **Note:** Create big impactful companies. What are we going to build we’re gonna be proud of. Take a product and build a platform. The best ideas are simple and don’t make people’s eyes gloss over when they hear it they light up. Don’t serve a niche but the market. Reimagine the world. Make something that takes more time. Not built in a month.
- Embrace Change as an Opportunity for Growth
  Summary:
  Relentless hard work and the immigrant experience cultivate a builder mentality, forming resilience in adapting to new environments.
  Frequent relocations foster the ability to face change positively, transforming it into networking opportunities. Engaging in sports enhances social skills and encourages proactivity in forming connections, rather than retreating into established comfort zones.
  Central to this approach is the belief in a purposeful life endowed by God, driving a commitment to seize opportunities.
  Embracing grace amidst imperfection—both in oneself and others—creates a more enjoyable and harmonious work environment, allowing for personal and professional growth.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I think, obviously a relentless hard work to kind of go pursue the things that you want to go get. And I think like so many other immigrant stories, immigrants are entrepreneurs in their nature. And so I think it's really built this builder DNA within me. Actually moving around, we had to move around a lot, mostly for visa reasons. I ended up going to eight different schools growing up. And so that just really shaped me in terms of new environments don't phase me, change maybe doesn't phase me as much. Actually, it's an opportunity to build and connections. And I feel fortunate now because I have friends across six different states and seven different elementary schools and things like that. And so I think that's morphed into what we do now.
  Speaker 2
  Can I ask one follow-up? Please. Let's say I'm the seventh elementary school. What had you gotten good at to enter a new environment like that with the experience of the prior six?
  Speaker 1
  I'm going to have to reflect on it. I think, honestly, sports helped in some way. And so meeting new teammates, I just got used to it. So I just knew that the first month I wasn't going to have friends. And then by the third month, I will have friends. And I think it pushed me to also be proactive as well, which I think if you're just going to be reactive, the default comfort zone for everyone is to hang out with their old friends. And so taught me to be proactive and try to find ways to connect with folks.
  Speaker 2
  What Christian idea is the most meaningful to you?
  Speaker 1
  It would have to boil down to the life that Jesus modeled on earth. Christian obviously centered around Christ, so everything flows from Jesus. But I think one of the things that's been really powerful is the idea that I believe I was created by God. There's a purpose for me on my life, and I think that's really shaped the intensity and the energy by which I approach things. Because if I believe that this is where God's put me, this is the opportunity he's put me in, then it's on me to make the most of it. That's probably the biggest idea. I think the second thing that's really modeled by Jesus and the whole idea of him coming to connect us back to God, to be the person who forgives us, this idea of having grace in everything. There's no way to be perfect. The people you're going to work with aren't perfect. There are going to be mistakes along the way. And so really how to lean with grace through things has really been a part that's just made the intensity of work much more enjoyable in a way where I feel like I don't have to harbor or hold The things or to feel wronged in a way, but just to lean into grace, have that hopefully be a default posture. And hopefully that makes me a more agreeable person to be around, but also it's made me enjoy the day to day a lot more. ([Time 1:24:08](https://share.snipd.com/snip/38ba4718-b5bc-4ec3-bdd8-2e25f6f5c30a))
    - **Note:** Be proactive in connecting with people and have grace.
