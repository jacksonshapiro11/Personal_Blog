### Highlights

- Michael Jordan's Competitive Drive: The Impact of His Father's Words
  Summary:
  Michael Jordan's competitive nature was deeply influenced by his father's words, particularly the seemingly insignificant comment about 'just go in the house with the women.' This remark sparked a relentless competitive streak in Jordan, turning his accomplishments into a battle against his father's negative opinions and declarations of his worthlessness.
  His father's early treatment became the driving force behind Jordan's fierce determination and motivation in his basketball career.

  Speaker 1
  Sentences that James Jordan uttered to his youngest son, this one was the one that glowed neon bright across the decades. His father's mean words had activated deep within some errant strain of DNA, a mutation of competitive nature so strong as to almost seem titanium. Years later, during the early days of his MBA career, he confessed that it was his father's early treatment of him, and his dad's declaration of his worthlessness that became the driving Force that motivated him. Each accomplishment that he achieved was his battle cry for defeating his father's negative opinions of him. Michael paid him back again and again by achieving so much in a life that his father could never hope to grasp. That is what offspring of disapproving fathers often do. Without even realizing it, they lock in on an answer and deliver it over and over, confirming that they do not need to just go in the house. And they continue to confirm it even after the father has gone to dust as if they are unconsciously yelling across time in an argument with the old man. That was an excerpt from the book that I'm going to talk to you about today, which is Michael Jordan, the life and it was written by Roland Lazenby. Remember that part about his father for the end because at the end of ([Time 0:01:19](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f6581e06-e145-4d15-baee-ae365042dff6))
    - **Note:** Michaels dad discounted him and made him feel worthless. This fueled his drive to become the best. His dads declaration of worthlessness was his driving force to become the best. Coco channel was a orphan who got 2% of all channel perfume sales. Spielberg started on the universal lot and ended up getting 2% of all theme park revenues. Jordan grew up in the sticks of willington and makes 5% of Jordan brand sales a year which is 3.6bn. His competence was only exceeded by his confidence. His external confidence covered his internal doubt. When Jordan was unsuccessful he would relentlessly practice working on what we was worst at. He would test the limits of his potential. Michael was incredibly lazy but when he played basketball he had a relentless work ethic. Doing what you love but couldn’t have worked a 9-5 would’ve been a failure. He uses every single slight as motivation. He goes through a ton of emotional pain in his grow. Excellence is the capacity to take pain. Time is the best filter Michael would study the greats. Learning from and respecting those who came before him. Driven to be the best and found the way to channel his selfishness to the best of the team. He was always learn. Average players want to be left alone but great players want to be constantly told what they’re doing right or wrong so they can be perfect. His rate of learning was so high and his rate of improvement he visualized his success clearly and that’s what was able to motivate him.
- Sam Walton, Michael Jordan, and the Power of Arrogance
  Summary:
  Sam Walton, Michael Jordan, and other successful individuals have faced criticism and rejection in their journeys.
  Instead of letting it affect their self-esteem, they chose to use their arrogance to fuel their ambitions. By harnessing their confidence and belief in themselves, they turned their dreams into reality, leading to unparalleled success in their respective fields.

  Gas so they say that I'm gassed, but without it, I'd be last so I ought to laugh. I really do believe based on what I read in this book and what I've learned spending, you know, all these hours studying Michael Jordan. I feel at the very beginning, he used his arrogance, his false arrogance as the steam to power his dreams. And once his belief in himself matched with, once it's, once his skill level matched his confidence, there was no turning back and there was just going to be no denying or no stopping Michael Jordan. This is a little bit about the progress he's making playing college ball. And this is going to be maybe bizarre to you. But again, I think of everything I everything knew I read. I think in terms of all the all the stuff I've read up until this point, right? So what Michael Jordan is about to say here is going to be very similar to what we learned from Edwin Land, right? The founder of Polaroid. And so this is Jordan. He says, I started to do things other people couldn't do. And that intrigued me more because of the excitement I got from the fans, from the people and still having the ability to do things that other people can't do, but want to do. And they can only see that through you. That drives me. I'm able to do something that no one else can do. So I read that paragraph and what popped in my mind is Edwin Land, one of my favorite quotes from ([Time 0:23:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/418bf5ca-c54e-4e17-8a7d-b6f4136854e4))
    - **Note:** Jordan went to the 5 star basketball camp as a no one this was a turning point in his life when he played against the best and realized they weren’t as good as him. He had been told he wasn’t good enough many times but like Kanye or Sam Walton who was told he couldn’t work a jp penny hordan just pushed himself harder. belief proceeds achievement and it’s how you react to adversity. Don’t do anything someone else could do. Jordan loss of the high school championship and he never forgot it he let that loss drive him. The rock takes getting cut from the nfl as a sign his back is always against the wall and he has to be relentless no matter how successful he is. Use pain and fuel. At North Carolina he learned how to play the game by mastering the fundamentals and working harder than anyone. His greatest ability was his ability to listen his capacity to be coached then go do it was his best attribute. Jordan was told by Roy Williams he wasn’t worked hard enough when he said he was working as hard as everyone else Williams said he needed to work harder to be the best. Jordan never forgot this he would watch his tape for hours in silence working with a student who filmed for him. He was so focused on improvement and never partied. By his sophomore year his abilities started to match his supereme confidence.
- Bobby knight do the little things be the best you can be and the score takes care of itself. Sonny vaccaro was talking with college coaches trying to get the Nike brand everywhere. He is given 2.5mm to sign a few young players but he is focused on instead focusing on one which was Jordan. He didn’t want to do it but his mom made him take the meeting and when she heard they were going for a partnership was very inclined. Nikes success was tied to Jordan and he got a percent of the cut. Shoe deals weren’t big at this time and he wanted to go with adidas his mom helped convince him to go with Nike. Leverage point in discussion. Jordan came into a losing team and practiced like every day was game 7. He was the match that inighted a dynasty it just takes that one moment to do it. The nba had a rule all shoes must be white the first Jordan’s had red and Nike agreed to pay the 5k fine every game. He won rookie of the year and they projected to sell $3mm of sneakers they ended up selling $150mm in the first 3 years. Banned product plus greatness. He still wasn’t ready and couldn’t figure it out he was in agony and terrior thinking he’d never win. ([Time 0:34:06](https://share.snipd.com/snip/55f260dc-219f-47ed-a872-887913b49f4f))

    - **Note:** Do the work and the score takes care of itself. Instead of signing a group of players Sonny vacaro wanted to sign just Jordan and create a partnership. Didn’t diversify but went all in. They basically invented the show deal which makes Jordan 200mm a year he gets a 5% cut abs helped establish Nike. The nba fined him for wearing read shoes and Nike gladly paid it. Good publicity. Nike realized in discussions mikes mom was the leverage point.
      Jordan’s darkest moment was the year before his title and he practiced like every day was game 7. One man changes the culture.

- Tex winter was the person who turned the bulls into the dynasty. He looked at the existing industry from a different point of view he was able innovate as a result of that difference he developed his own philosophy on work this lead to the invention of the triangle. He had 40 years of experience people thought he was crazy he didn’t have plays but a system and philosophy of how to play the game. The gm believed in him so fired Doug Collins and hired Phil. Tex was focused on the fundamentals doing things the right way. He taught with the direct frankness of a middle school teacher. Jordan had to evolve the pistons set their entire defense to neutralize him and he realized he needed to change. Growth is non linear it’s an up and down process.

    - **Note:** Tex winter saw the game that people had played for ages from a different perspective. The bulls had to build a system to win which took years and they almost gave up. This growth is non linear and it’s always darkest before the dawn. Tex was very frank with players treating them like middle schoolers. Tex built for the long term from first principles. This shows a jump to universality and how Phil jackson made his career by trusting Tex winter.

  Had contemplated before. He's also differentiating salt Jordan. That is from other people, you know, people are in college. They're drinking. They're doing drugs. Same thing happens when he gets into the NBA at the very beginning. There now you have all these students that lived on the same floor as Jordan when he's 19. So this is observations from fellow students about Michael at 19. And you can really summarize this this sentence or should be the section ([Time 0:34:06](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7ff4f9ef-492b-4ec8-b8dd-1a896260995f))

    - **Note:** Phil was willing to compromise with tex and install his philosophy and system. He wanted zen buddism and tex wanted the triangle. This took years to implement and frustration was boiling over by the year after they almost gave up they won. Importance of mental stability and designing a system. It’s not how you behave in the good but the bad times. Systems are great you need to build the activation energy.
- When Jordan played for team USA he saw how much harder the pulls practiced and how everyone else relied on naturally talent and could’ve been better. They were deceiving themselves about what it took to be successful/ what the game required. When bosh was playing for team USA in 08 he wanted to be early and was the first one to breakfast but came to see Kobe sweating with ice packs on his knees only days after losing the nba finals when Bosh hadn’t made the playoffs. What success takes legends are defined by their response to failure. Jordan was confused how lazy his teammates were about practice which was something that defined Jordan’s career. His love of practice made him billions because his performance was what drove people to buy his shoes they wanted to associate the themselves with excellence.

    - **Note:** All things come from compounding and you need to mitigate ego to win. Jordan used the constant compounding of practice to become great. He had a singleness of purpose and focus learned from the greats and that’s how he became the best.
      Jordan never got over his dads death and needed his approval even after all his success.
