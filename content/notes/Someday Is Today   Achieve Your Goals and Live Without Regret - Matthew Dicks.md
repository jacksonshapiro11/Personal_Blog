  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Another thing that I really encourage people to think about, I was just doing it with someone yesterday. I think sometimes people see a goal or a dream as a linear process, like A to B to C. And I think that's always a mistake too. So I was working with someone yesterday who said, I want to write a memoir.
  Speaker 2
  And I said, we'll start writing a memoir.
  Speaker 1
  And she said, I don't know where to start. And I said, do you have some good moments that you know you want to include? She said, oh, yeah.
  Speaker 2
  I said, well, write those. She said, don't you have to start a book at the beginning?
  Speaker 1
  I said, no, you write something. Just write chapter 15, if that's what you can write today, like save chapter one for the day you can write chapter one, but write whatever you can on a given day. And that applies for everything that we're doing.
  Speaker 6
  Sort of, you know, as I'm building a business is absolutely the next thing I'm supposed to do.
  Speaker 1
  But if I don't want to do that thing, for some reason my motivation to do that task on that day is not there, I do recognize there are a multitude of other tasks that will need to be completed. So I will go deal with those tasks today. So rather than seeing goals as linear, just see it as it's a series of things that need to be done. And in terms of time management, that helps a lot too. Because if your next thing that you have to complete takes two hours, sometimes people will just wait for a two hour period when there's also like a 10 minute project and a 15 minute project and maybe a six hour project, but can actually be broken down into 10 minute increments. It does not need to be done in the full six hours all at once. So seeing your dream as stepping stones, but you get to touch whichever one you want at any point because you're going to have to touch all of them eventually. That's really helpful.

    - **Note:** Most of success is just starting and getting going and doing what you can do today to advance the dream. Dreams aren’t linear.

  Episode.
  Speaker 4
  There's a great story that you tell in your new book some day is today about, I think you had a lunch with someone and they were a few minutes late, like seven minutes late or something. I wonder if you can tell that story because that's one that's really, really stuck with me.
  Speaker 1
  So I always am willing to give fledgling writers 30 minutes of my time if they will meet me in the place that I happen to be. And I was in McDonald's that day, which is actually one of my favorite places to meet writers at some. I like the sort of tearing away of all of what people see as writing, which is, you know, I need to be at a coffee shop with smooth jazz and a cappuccino. I like to put them at a plastic table with a lot of noise and and Diet Coke. So she met me at the McDonald's and she was late. And so when she sat down, I said, tell me what you're playing.
  Speaker 2
  What you doing?
  Speaker 1
  And she started describing this book, you know, and it sounded interesting. Like I was like, this sounds like a good project, but I just waited for my moment. And then eventually I said, as I always say to writers, I say, so how much have you written? And so often, almost always the answer is, Oh, I haven't started writing anything yet.
  Speaker 2
  And I then I said to her, I said, well, you were seven minutes late today.
  Speaker 1
  And she said, I'm sorry. You know, she bet. I'm so sorry. I'm like, no, no, my point was not that you were seven minutes late. And I was upset. My point was I used the seven minutes that you were late to write some sentences. You know, I turned my computer, I said, this is what I wrote in the seven minutes that you were late, right? She was a person who believed she could only write in a two hour block that her ideal writing time was like 10 to 12, you know, that she needed to be in a certain place and a certain mind frame, which is so often every creative person's belief that they only work under certain circumstances, ideally.
  Speaker 2
  So I reminded her that during World War one, there were men and trenches wearing gas masks, artillery exploding over their heads, and they were scribbling in little books in journals, hoping that if they survive this battle and the many battles that were to come, someday they might publish something. So thank goodness that the writers of the 1910s did not require Starbucks smooth jazz and two hour quiet blocks of time for them to get their work done, because that's just not a reality, especially if you actually want to make a thing. If you want to do something like a vegetable garden in your backyard or write a book or create a YouTube channel, if you actually want to do it, you should want to be doing it whenever it's possible. So I tell all of the creative people of the world 10 minutes is precious to you. It doesn't mean in 10 minutes, I can write a chapter, but you know, in 10 minutes, I can reread the last three paragraphs I wrote earlier today and see if they're okay and clean them up a little bit, or I can write five good new sentences. So it's just the idea that people, they just assume they need these ideal situations in order to create something lovely.
  Speaker 1
  You know, whereas like Van Gogh was like mentally unstable and unmedicated and produced some of the greatest work in the world, you know, but had he been living in 2022, people might have said, well, let's get control of some of your mental illness first. Let's experiment with some medication before we get you painting, right? Like it's always this idea that everything has to be right before we launch. And that's not true. We should just launch. We launch now. We're not the space program. We're not putting people into orbit where we have to be careful.
  Speaker 2
  We just have to take steps forward.
  Speaker 1
  And as is the case with most people, she really wasn't invested in writing. She was invested in the idea of having written or in the idea that I can quit my job and write from 10 to 12 every day and then have lunch with my friends. And that is the writer's life, which is, as you well know, not the writer's life.
  Speaker 3
  Nice. Yeah, I think back to that bit of your book whenever I feel like, oh, you know, I should probably do some book stuff right now, but I've only got 23 minutes until, you know, until this thing that I have to do and like, oh, you know, I could go down, I could get a coffee, get a biscuit, just like lounge around a bit. I can't get anything done in 23 minutes.
  Speaker 8
  I need, I need hours and hours, you know, with my, with my flat whites in my hat, like my Lord of the Rings and my background music to get into the zone.
  Speaker 7
  But I love the way you put that of like, in the seven minutes, I wrote some sentences.
  Speaker 4
  I'm just thinking like, I should just have that approach.
  Speaker 3
  Because like when I was, you know, when I was, when I was working as a doctor and trying to do the YouTube thing on the side, I would use those seven minutes blocks of time. Here and there to write stuff for videos. Like if I'd be on the toilet, instead of scrolling Twitter on my phone, I'd be on notion typing out some stuff for a video. Or if I'm waiting eight minutes for patients and blood results to arrive and there's no one else in the waiting room and there's nothing for me to do. It's like, great, let's open up notion on the Windows computers in front of me and just like type out a few notes for a video. And so many people in my, in my academy ask like, oh, but like, I've got, I've got a job like how do you, how do you do YouTube alongside the job?
  Speaker 8
  I'm always like, like, like, there are very few jobs where you don't have small, small amounts of time here and there where you normally waste scrolling on your phone.
  Speaker 3
  Where if you wanted to, and if you really cared about this thing, I'm not saying you have to, but if you did, you could potentially spend that time opening up Apple Notes and just drafting a few bullet points for your next video. And I think I've got that approach to YouTube, but I really don't have the approach to the book because for the book, I've convinced, I've talked myself into believing the bullshit that like, I need to, I need to have four hours and like the appropriate coffee cup and all that crap.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, well, I wrote my fifth novel, almost all of it in faculty meetings while teaching. Now admittedly, it's a book of lists. It's a novel written by an obsessive list maker. So the book is told or the story is told to list after list after list after list. But I wrote almost all of those lists in those moments of a faculty meeting when something was being said that was irrelevant to me, which was an enormous number of minutes in those faculty meetings, or I always arrive five minutes early and I use those five minutes. And as things are wrapping up or we have a raffle at the end of it because that's going to make us happy, I'd just be writing lists. And the beauty of that was I didn't even need to write on a computer. I could have a post it note that I'm writing a list on and that can later be transferred into the computer. I wrote a whole book during meetings.
  Speaker 2
  And you know, I always remind people a book is probably about 5,000 sentences. So like incrementalism, right, pile up 5,000 sentences and you have a book.
  Speaker 1
  I can't guarantee that's going to be a good book. But that depends on you and your effort and skill and experience. But it's 5,000 sentences. And if I write seven sentences here, I am a lot closer to 5,000 that I was a minute ago. I really believe that that seven sentence step forward is a significant one, especially because I know I'll do that 23 times today. I'll take 23 moments in my day to write somewhere between one and 50 sentences. And if I just keep doing that, you know, that is why ([Time 1:00:14](https://share.snipd.com/snip/564d4bfc-fcfc-40f2-902a-b3076f025cdf))
    - **Note:** Don’t get in the perfect mindset to do something just fucking do it. People wrote novels with gas masks in trenches. You don’t need the perfect environment or the right coffee just do it. Also telling people like van gough to address emotional instability is destroying what made him great. Not everything has to be right before we launch let’s just launch and figure it out. People don’t want to be writers they want to have written. If you have 5 minutes and a book is 5000 sentences and you can right 2-3 and you do that 20 times a week that’s 10% of your book. Monetize dead time.
