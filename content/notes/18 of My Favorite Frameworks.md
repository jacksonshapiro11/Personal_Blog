### Highlights

- 1) Location, vocation, relation: Where you live, what you do, who you're dating or married to. Try not to change more than one at a time.
  2) Do something fast, do it for cheap, do it at a high quality. Pick two.
  3) Head, heart, wallet: Three questions to ask yourself if you don't know what to write about â€” what does your head want you to write about? what does your heart want you to write about? what does your wallet want you to write about?
  4) Frank Slootman's mantra for running companies: increase the tempo, raise the standards, narrow the focus.
  5) High/Low self-monitors: High self-monitors adjust to the people around them. They're highly flexible and good at getting along with people, but they can be social chameleons. Low self-monitors don't adjust to their audience or change their behavior based on the situation. (Source:[@GrahamDuncanNYC](https://twitter.com/GrahamDuncanNYC))
  6) Voice, exit, and loyalty: If you're frustrated with a situation, there are three ways to respond: (1) voice means making a complaint or offering a suggestion, (2) exit means to leave the situation, and (3) loyalty means to put your head down and stay.
  7) The shape of stories: A character who wants something encounters a problem before they can get it. At the peak of their despair, a guide steps into their lives, gives them a plan, and calls them to action. That action helps them avoid failure and ends in a success. (Source: Donald Miller)
  8) At any point in a movie, you should be able to pause and ask: (1) what does the hero want? (2) who or what is stopping the hero from getting what they want? (3) What will the hero's life look like if they get what they want? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvfds2zmenbja7ykxb6y6sxt))
