    - **Note:** The calculator brain seeks to abstract from the current knowledge base while the meditative brain creates new models and works in the white space of the world. Vital to innovate rather than extrapolate.
- Decide is cutting all other alternatives. Discern is to see the difference between two paths and take the best one forward
    - **Tags:** #decision-making, #decision-making-(important/reversable-matrix)
    - **Note:** Decisions are pruning paths.

    - **Note:** You have a core desire that sits at your deepest level of identity and you shape your life around that core desire. It guides you.
- Immanent desire is when you are at the mercy of the desires modeled to you. You are spinning in a gravitron can’t look left or right just stick a prisoner to your own desires
    - **Tags:** #prisoner-to-your-ideas, #desire, #mimetic-desire
    - **Note:** Prisoner to your own desires

Understand what others enjoy and help them cultivate their thick desires is the best way to lead not through your views or desire
- Tell stories from your life when you felt fulfilled and had meaning. This helps reveal your thick desires. You can’t understand desires from actions you need to dig deep to get to the core of the meaning to understand desire. Are you painting something because you think it’s pretty or is there deep meaning in it

    - **Note:** Thick desires help us understand what we really love and need and not what society tells us we should want. Follow thick desires this will lead to more happiness
- Disruptive empathy is when you connect with a memetic rival on a person level and realize you are very similar. Memetic rival changes the relationship when you stop seeing others as rivals and see them as equals/ friend. Getting to know people at their core and listening to stories of deeply fulfilling action which creates empathy. Through empathy we can reverse a negative memetic cycle
- Do what you would least regret on your deathbed. The view from up high is different than below when you have 3 Michelin stars 3 stars means less than to someone who has 1-2 stars

    - **Note:** Regret minimizing framework and nothing is so toxic to a dream as it’s realization opiod of hope.
- Make sure the goals you set are influenced by the right desires the ones you truly care about and value not what society says you should value

    - **Note:** inform your beliefs with thick desires internal locus of control
- We went from scapegoating defending scapegoats and imaging we could never scapegoat someone. Scapegoating is pasty of human nature and that’s why it happens constantly with humans
    - **Tags:** #scapegoat, #desire, #blame
    - **Note:** Scapegoating is part of human nature
- Everyone has a hierarchy of values understand yours so you can make decisions when these values counteract each other codify and rank your values
    - **Tags:** #mimetic-desire, #understanding-yourself, #belief-stack/web, #thick-vs-thin-desire, #decision-making-(important/reversable-matrix)
    - **Note:** Understand your hierarchy of values to better codify decisions
- Start positive flywheels of desire. Where wanting something leads to others wanting something and this leads to stronger brand power and more desire. Each step logically leads to the next step and the last step closes the loop to link with the first step
    - **Tags:** #desire, #cultivate-desire, #flywheel
    - **Note:** Apple has a flywheel of desire. Blue text AirPods brand halo.
- Memes spread like a virus to dawkins evolving and changing and are discrete things and words like cat pictures. Memetic theory is imitating for the sake of copying a model not a behavior. Ie mirrored imitation doing the complete opposite of a model likely one you are in rivalry and competition with

    - **Note:** Memes are ideas and behaviors in our minds evolving and changing to become what gets better replicated. Mimesis is models that form frameworks for how we live our lives and why we value what we value and do what we do. Mimetic theory tells us what to copy and explains why we copy a behavior and or reject a behavior which is perpetuating the negative which is similar to copying.
      Models exist and we aim to copy it.
- Embrace influence instead of always trying to start from ground 0. Know when to lean into memesis
- We don’t fight because we are different but because we are the same
    - **Tags:** #mimetic-desire, #similarity-and-conflict
- Desire becomes reflexive we want something so others want something our desires shape up. Snowball effect. It becomes a rivalry of reflexive desire where you only want something because other people do or your rival most
    - **Tags:** #desire, #desire-is-relational, #desire-is-reflexive, #feedback-loops
- Examine why experts are experts. Are the proven or are you taking someone else’s word for it dig to the ground level to see if it’s real expertise or just a facade. Find what is true no matter how many people want to believe it

- We prefer the opinions of experts to the lay man and search for this everywhere ie shark tank podcasts we want to learn from expert models
    - **Tags:** #expertise, #experts, #mimetic-models, #justified-true-belief, #knowledge-gain
    - **Note:** We want to model experts.
- Leaving space for wonder or creating some mystic aura around you makes you more desirable a cat that wants nothing becomes a strong model of desire to people who admire the need to not be wanted
    - **Tags:** #mimetic-desire, #cultivate-desire, #mimetic-models
    - **Note:** People admire those who seem mysterious and unavailable they want to be wanted. Like Enzo Ferrari not selling inventory to seem like there was more demand.
- Models inside our circles may seem different but they observe many of the same qualities and rules because we are more similar than we are different so we compete
    - **Tags:** #mimetic-desire, #similarity-and-conflict, #mimetic-models
    - **Note:** Models in our circle observe similar rules so there is more competition the closer you are
- Models outside of us are not as hard to imitate because they are so outside of our circles that we don’t see them and they dint see us as a threat so these people can be held high in the sky with little to no effect to us when we imitate these are models so far away they don’t really matter to us outside of immatatibg and creating desire ie no competition
    - **Tags:** #niche, #mimetic-models, #mimetic-desire, #competition, #similarity-and-conflict
    - **Note:** Models outside of our niche are ok because we're not in mimetic competition and we can even idolize these people
- Two types of models those outside of our world and those inside. Being outside society and a renegade is an appealing model
    - **Tags:** #mimetic-desire, #mimetic-models
- Models are most powerful and influential when people think they come from inside and are their own so desire needs to be modeled organically
    - **Tags:** #mimetic-desire, #ideas-(make-others-think-your-idea-is-theirs), #agency
    - **Note:** People's models are more powerful when they feel they have more agency over them. Make others think they have agency and get to your idea.
- Give the right people the right models someone wanted people to eat eggs and bacon so he had doctors recommend it. He wanted kids to use soap for a company marketing plan and had teachers display it to kids effective models

    - **Note:** Models and identity are pervasive in the culture and marketing is all about cultivating desire. We would do well to align our incentives and goals. Create the right models to cultivate desire
- Kids model desires very overtly and as time fits on we make our desires more convert and invisible but they are still very much there just harder to see
    - **Tags:** #modeling-desire, #mimetic-models, #mimetic-desire, #desire-(overt-or-hidden)
- Models suggest desires and the harder it is to reach the more desirable it. Models aren’t inherently bad but when we fail to understand the impact they have on our lives and how they influence us they become an issue
    - **Tags:** #understanding-yourself, #mimetic-models, #difficult-circumstance-(not-what-you-do-when-it's-easy-but-when-it's-hard), #mimetic-desire, #cultivate-desire, #desire, #influence, #want-what-we-can't-have, #feel-our-feelings
    - **Note:** Models are neutral but we need to understand that we want things we cant have and gain a deeper understanding of how things are influencing us so they don't corrupt us
- People don’t want to destroy things they don’t want they want to destroy things they do want. The more people fight the more we resemble each other. We should choose our enemies wisely because we become like them
    - **Tags:** #enemies-(choose-them-wisely), #mimetic-models, #similarity-and-conflict, #mimetic-desire
    - **Note:** We fight because we are the same. Choose your enemies who you will inform yourself for your desire carefully.
- Human beings fight not because we’re different but because we’re the same
    - **Tags:** #mimetic-desire, #favorite, #similarity-and-conflict
- Desiree come from the desires of others not interval desires. Desire doesn’t lie autonomously in one thing or person but it lives relationally in the space between people. They books were not plot driven but desire driven. All the books he taught had a model of desire and an imitator.

    - **Note:** Desire is relational we are told what to desire based on what others desire. Everything is relative and desire is not global but relational to your comparison group
- Past our basic needs we rely on imitation you won’t not drink if you’re thirsty but after meeting our basic needs we enter in to the world of desire and knowing what do want is different than knowing what to need. Models shape our desires. You have a model from everything from what you dress like to what water you drink
    - **Tags:** #marketing, #simplicity-(power-of), #mimetic-desire, #mimetic-models, #desire, #modeling-desire, #internal-locus-of-control
    - **Note:** Past our basic desires we are looking to models for insights. We don’t need more than basic water or clothes but we look to models for energy drinking and luxury wear.
      Knowing what we want is unclear we need to be reinforced by others.
