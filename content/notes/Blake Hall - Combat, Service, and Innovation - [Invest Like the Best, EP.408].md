### Highlights

- **From Average to 90% Success Rate**
  * Blake Hall, former U.S. Army officer, shares his experience leading a kill-capture team in Iraq. 
  * When you’re deployed you enter a god mode. The beginning you’re fresh the end you’re worried about leaving in the middle you surrender without fear and this drives your most success. Very interesting 
  * Initially, the team's success rate was below average, around 20%. 
  * Through relentless preparation, studying enemy patterns, and planning for contingencies, their success rate increased to over 90%. 
  * Hall emphasizes the importance of codifying learning and adapting strategies based on feedback. 
  * This experience taught him the value of preparation and contingency planning, which he carried into his entrepreneurial endeavors.

  Patrick O'Shaughnessy
  I want to come back to, you said something there, which reminds me of what you're building now, which is the fact that you got extended from 12 months, I think, to 15 months. And I'm putting a pin in that because that's going to become a relevant detail when we talk about the origins of the business in a little bit. I'm curious in that stretch of time, what did you learn about yourself that you didn't know prior? I think the thing that you can't know is just if you're going to be brave, everyone's scared when you're over in combat.
  Blake Hall
  You're not normal if you're not scared. But character is about pushing all that down and doing the right thing for the men that you lead when the chips are down. And honestly, every firefight is different. For me, just in terms of becoming a man and as a rite of passage, will I be able to do my job when it counts? And you just don't know that until you're shot at. And it changes over time. The military has done a lot of research now to show that over the course of your deployment, at like month six or seven, you go into God phase that you've survived enough of combat that You actually will take extreme risk. And when we hit that time mark, when we were down in Baghdad, we got into firefights where other captains would come out with us and ride. And I'd be walking around, my snipers be walking around laughing, playing, shooting. And they were like, you guys are just absolutely insane. But then as you get closer to coming home, you start almost like sports. You're playing like not to lose. And so it's really interesting as you take the most casualties at the beginning of your deployment when you don't have a lot of context about what the enemy is doing, but also at the end When you're playing not to lose. It's actually in the middle when I get back as I was about to come home, I would think about what I'd done in the middle of my deployment and my hands would shake because I was just, oh my God. So there's like these overarching learnings about, are you going to be brave enough to put the team and your brothers before yourself? But also there's, it's not even the same. There's these other contextual things that influence groups. And I think as a leader, you have to understand those team dynamics too, because the whole point of leadership is to be inversely correlated with the context. When the team is playing not to lose, you have to counter that with extreme aggression in terms of the mindset to offset because you know where the team's headed. When they're overly sort of risk-taking, you need to try to mitigate risk and pull it back. But the other thing was, similar to entrepreneurship, we were given a novel problem set. And so I had a team, we had a mission, but we had never practiced for using signal intelligence and different techniques to basically be a SWAT team. That was new. And so a lot of it was just the scientific method of having a certain way of doing things and then codifying learning. So when we would come back, we would say, what worked really well that we should keep? What didn't work so well? And over time, that led to a lot of specialization. And so maybe the arc in terms of performance, if you can codify learning and feedback loops, the average success rate for these kill capture missions was like 44%, I think, give or take. And in the first three months, we were in the 20th percentiles, which is to say that we sucked. But around month three, we hit average. And then we caught the head of the Mujahideen Shura Council for Mosul, which is this clearinghouse of nationalists and extremist Islamist groups. And we caught the spiritual leader of Northern Iraq for Al-Qaeda. So we were designated the kill capture force of choice for Northern Iraq by Colonel Townsend, who went on to become a four-star general. But by the end, our success rate was over 90%. And I think by some metrics was like leading the theater in terms of our efficiency. So there was a lot. That was my first real job. I had a lawn mowing business and lifeguarding, but that was my first real job.
  Patrick O'Shaughnessy
  What did you do to drive from average to 90% as the leader?
  Blake Hall
  I was relentless in preparation. I had an amazing team where there was a lot of prior selection that had gone into it. So in recon, you get to pick whoever you want. So I had already screened my team for certain skills to make sure that I had a good group around me. But the platoon leader is responsible for the maneuver and for getting the folks to the right place at the right time and orienting them to target. So I spent basically all of my free time studying these terrorist cells, their pattern, what was called pattern of life, where they would be on a Tuesday for lunch, what their tendencies Were. And it's just like anything else, humans get lazy, and they get complacent. And if you're willing to put in a time, you could really get a feel for how this person operated and where they were likely to make a mistake. It was that. And then just, I think the biggest difference between mediocre leaders and great leaders is great leaders plan for contingencies. So before we even went on a mission, we would plan for all the things that might happen. So when it did happen, we knew what to do. I think relentless preparation and learning is just so important because it both inoculates you against risk proactively. But then if you do find yourself in a position where everyone's like, you're in fight or flight, the adrenaline's going, it's really difficult to communicate and tell everyone exactly What you want to do. The more that you've rehearsed that and prepared for it, the better you're going to be able to execute when it counts. And the military really drilled that into me. And I've carried that particular lesson with me throughout my life. ([Time 0:13:48](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0857dcb3-4e93-47fa-aa62-64d5ae03e49a))
- **Earning the Right to Lead**
  * Prove your grit and resilience through challenging experiences to demonstrate leadership worthiness.
  * Be highly skilled in your area of expertise to gain the respect of your team.
  * Prioritize continuous learning to adapt to increasing responsibilities as a leader.
  * Demonstrate genuine care for your team's well-being, putting their needs above your own.
  * Commit to relentless preparation and unwavering dedication, especially when the stakes are high.
  * A true leader cares more about his men then anyone and is also a star player on the team. Story of when a friend got blown up concussed by an ied helped his men. The last thing he said was make sure my men are ok then he passed out that’s leadership

  Blake Hall
  And I just remember I got to this point where I didn't care if my parachute opened or not because I was that miserable. I just had poison ivy everywhere. I felt terrible. I went at 195 pounds. I graduated at 162. So just starving. And I just remembered, I don't care if it opens or not. But I also realized I would die before I quit. And that's the purpose of that school. And what it means to have a Ranger tab is it separates people who are just psychologically really tough and resilient. And as a social signal to the men that you lead and everyone who sees it, it is an indicator that you have grit. And so I think as far as what gives you the right to lead, you have to put yourself through a crucible where you can prove to yourself and to your team that you're worthy to lead that tribe. And so I'm super grateful to Ranger School for providing that to me. The other part after the sort of grit part is that the leader has to be the most skilled at whatever it is they do. And when I showed up and talked to my men, I said, listen, I might not be the fastest, I might not be the best shooter, I might not be the best at combatives, but I'll be damned if I'm not top Five and everything. And so you just have to be really good at what you do across the board. And it's like sports, the team captain isn't necessarily the best player on the team, but they're one of the best players. And so I think that combination of grit and skill really matters. The hard part now about being a founder is if you're fortunate enough to scale, you take on more and more scope and the skills you need to be effective. And so you need to be a relentless learner. But I think at the core, if you care about people, if you have the grit yourself, or you'll put in whatever hours it takes, you'll never give up. And then you are curious and you're capable of learning the skill that you need. You've got to do all three and you've got to do it in an excellent fashion if you want to keep up with what is required to lead a team and to be an effective leader. In Iraq, where the stakes were my men's life, there wasn't anything I wasn't willing to do to prepare myself for that. And I think those habits that were so deeply set from when I was a young man in my early 20s have carried through to today.
  Patrick O'Shaughnessy
  Is there an episode of leadership from someone in your orbit during your time overseas that most exemplifies leadership to you that you saw some other leader perform?
  Blake Hall
  Yeah, my buddy, Phil Schneider, is my worst day in Iraq. We were in a neighborhood called Dora, which the LA Times referred to as Al-Qaeda's Alamo in Baghdad. And we were 13 months into combat. We took more casualties in two weeks in that neighborhood, like a three by five kilometer box than we take in the 13 months. It was literally hell. There were standing sewage because Al Qaeda didn't care about the locals. They'd put in so many bombs into the sewer system that the sewage was just spilled out. It was a Sunni neighborhood. You had a Shia Iraqi army military unit that would snipe at people as they went out for groceries and things. Then little kids would chuck grenades at us. If there's hell on earth, it was probably Dora. And so the reason that Al-Qaeda would put these roadside bombs into the sewer system is the kind of law of explosives is that the force travels the path of least resistance. So if you have concrete on two sides and underneath, but the road is dirt, it's a natural charge that directs upwards into the bottom of a vehicle. So there's two elements to this. One was when I saw that was happening, they would put 500 pound buried bombs underneath that would literally saw a striker in half, like these 20 ton vehicles from front to back, just Rip it completely in half to give you an idea of the force. And so when I saw this during the surge, I wasn't getting a lot of sleep. The first thing I did is I went to the operations center. I said, give me the infrastructure plans for all the sewage system in Baghdad. And I went out to the truck with my radio telephone operator. And you have a graphic overlay of the streets. And we stayed out there until three in the morning, even though our next mission was like at 630, just until I had the final thing done. And once I had mapped it, I pushed it out to all the other trucks in our unit. And I said, for us, we are never gonna drive on these roads ever if we can avoid it. And if we do avoid it, you guys are both going to the rooftops. You're gonna cut every single wire down to the street. Phil was unfortunate enough, he went across an intersection that had one of these 500 pound bombs underneath it. And my platoon was the first to respond to that scene. And it was devastating, as you might imagine. He was just severely concussed, but was just relentless in terms of providing aid to his guys, getting them into the tracks. I'm going to get emotional about it, so I'm sorry. But we raced a few of the guys who were critically wounded to the green zone, to the combat sport hospital that was there. And Phil was just unbelievable. When we finally, when his men were taken care of, he was so concussed, he was puking and he knew that he was about to just pass out. And he just grabbed me by the lapels. And he said, Blake, my guys, take care of my guys. And that for me, it's just, that's what it is right there. His men love him for it, that when the chips are down, you care more about other people than yourself. And his like will, even though he was physically really banged up, got him through it. And I think, man, America is super lucky to have leaders like Phil Schneider. He was decorated for heroism for what he did that day.

- **Meaning of Life After Combat**
  * Blake Hall found profound purpose in his military service in Iraq, even amidst uncertainty about the overall strategy.
  * After leaving the military, he struggled to find similar meaning in civilian life, feeling a disconnect between his experiences and the everyday concerns of his peers.
  * He realized that material possessions held little value compared to making a positive impact, a perspective shaped by his combat experience.
  * This led him to start ID.me, driven by a mission to help others and find purpose beyond financial gain.
  * Didn’t want to do consulting ect.

  Blake Hall
  I was like, I'm pretty sure we all know the story of Iraq. It probably isn't going to turn out the best. But I was like, but for what we were asked to do, the math is pretty simple. This network killed thousands of people. And if it continued, it would have killed thousands of people more. It doesn't exist anymore. Intel folks come in and said, we've never seen a network taken down this fast ever. And I was like, you'll never see the faces of the people that you saved from the car bombs that didn't go off. But man, what an amazing thing to tell your grandkids about that you made a real difference here and an impact for those people. And you go from that. And I didn't believe America's, and the strategy was making the world better, because we were just creating these power vacuums and everything else. And I didn't want to be a part of taking life or risking life if I didn't feel like we had a strategy and a specific end that made sense. And so I didn't feel I could continue to serve in the military because there wasn't a strategy. But man, I missed the purpose that I felt. You don't have to question the meaning of your life when you're trying to get to a terrorist in a phone before a car bomb goes off in a market full of innocent civilians. So went from that scene and got into Harvard Business School because my battalion commander refused to write me a letter of recommendation unless I applied to Harvard. I was like, sir, I was like, I haven't used a three syllable word in the last year. I don't think I'm ready to write an essay for Harvard. He's like, you're going to apply to Harvard or I'm not going to write a letter of recommendation. So all of a sudden I'm in Cambridge, Massachusetts. I'm 26 years old. The biggest decision is like where to go on Friday to have a beer with my friends. I just couldn't shake it because I'd seen I'd been exposed to so much. And I just knew that life is short. You don't have a lot of time. None of us know how much time we have. War had just infused lightning into my bones. Every time you get one of these kill capture alerts, it's just a flood of adrenaline. So in some ways it makes you an addict. And so I realized, oh my gosh, like I've basically been turned into an addict by this 15 months of like really high intensity tempo, I want to make an impact. And what combat taught me is that you can't take anything with you. So material stuff like who cares, what matters is making a positive impact on someone else's life. And looking for that sense of purpose, I started to see stats around there was so much goodwill trying to get the military suffer from identity theft at rates that were nearly twice as High as the general population. And I can walk you through the story. But that ultimately became the thing that I gravitated towards because I felt it was a worthy mission to solve with my life. And that if something happened to me, that if God forbid, I were to die, I would do it trying to accomplish something that mattered and not being a cog in the wheel at a consulting firm or In banking, that's just making capitalism work a little bit more efficiently. And so I think just the nature of risk was quite different. I thought risk was going into an organization where I didn't believe in the mission. I felt like I was wasting my life. I didn't really care about the financial side nearly as much because how could you after coming out of combat? And so I'm super grateful for that. But it was very schizophrenic to go from a time in your life where you're like 70 years old, maybe in normal time, your friends are dying, you're contemplating your own mortality. Most of us will get there later. I kind of had already been there and then felt like a time traveler coming back. And it really just shifted my whole mindset. And it's why I started IDME, because I felt like it was a worthy mission to improve people's lives. I didn't know it would grow to become a multi-billion dollar company like it is today. I just wanted to help the military community that I came from to start. But that's the bridge for how I got from the military to running this technology company.

- **Four Steps to Epiphany**
  * Validate your problem hypothesis by having people pay for the solution. Have a scientific approach that can only be validated by someone paying you for it. 
  * Determine customer lifetime value and acquisition cost for sound unit economics. 
  * Focus on building a strong culture for market dominance, following steps one and two. 
  * Raising lots of money increases expectations and can lead to toxic behavior if product-market fit isn’t achieved first. 
  * Don't skip the four steps of the epiphany.
  Transcript:
  Patrick O'Shaughnessy
  I have one question going back to something you said earlier around the book that David gave you, the four steps to the epiphany of the Steve Blank book. Is there anything from that book that you, looking back on that time, find to be the most valuable that other people out there should think about? Yeah.
  Blake Hall
  So the four steps, just really quick, so maybe I can give you the cliff notes. The first one is just pure scientific method. Form a hypothesis that there's a problem worth solving and what that is. And then the way that you validate the hypothesis is that people are willing to pay you for the solution to solve it. And so until you've done that, you don't earn the right to even figure out if you've got a scalable company. So this constant iteration, this is what most founders struggle with. Am I even working on a problem that matters? You could convince yourself that your baby's not ugly and like every day, but the only way to really validate the problem is meaningful and your solution is the right one is to get people To pay you. And then Jeff Moore has written all this other literature around what part of the market's target. So the first two steps are, I have a hypothesis about a problem and my solution for it. And then step two is I validated it because somebody paid me to solve it for them. Now, once you've passed step two, it's four steps, the epiphany. Step three is how much revenue do I get from that customer when they pay me and for how long? And then how much does it cost me to acquire them? And those are your unit economics. You can see companies that skip the stage from two to three. This is living social, raised a billion dollars here in the DC market, went to zero. Because if you violate the four steps of the epiphany, if your unit economics are upside down, you're just going to set money on fire. Groupon pivots from daily deals to e-commerce, takes a haircut from 20 billion to five, but survives and is still around today because you can't violate the steps. And then if your unit economics are good, step four is really culture. And it's the Jim Collins good to great, great team, great retention, focus, alignment, all the things that help you capture hopefully a disproportional share of the market. And so what's really amazing is you can't skip stages. This is why you raise a ton of money from investors in Silicon Valley. Congratulations. You've just ratcheted up expectations. And if you don't fundamentally know your sort of ideal customer profile and whether you have product market fit or not, you can get really perverse incentives where folks try to move The revenue line up, even though the underlying unit economics are toxic.
  Patrick O'Shaughnessy
  Yeah, the genetics of the business are bad and therefore screwed. I'm starting to wonder then about if we zoom all the way to today, if you can give us sort of an overview on the topic and the importance of identity. This is something that I met you through Mickey at Ribbit and Mickey and ([Time 0:40:38](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b6bb5880-f9d5-4b40-9675-73cc55f4ee6b))
- **Shared Values & Company Culture**
  * Company culture should prioritize shared core values, like classic liberalism's emphasis on individual freedoms and equality. Not post modernist concepts of fairness and equality which may not be as grounded in truth. Truth seeking over all. 
  * Screening for these values during hiring is crucial for avoiding internal conflicts and maintaining a unified vision.
  * A strong culture fosters intimacy, trust, and fast decision-making by minimizing ideological tension.
  * Prioritize merit and performance, treating everyone fairly based on the same standards.
  * Encourage emotional self-regulation to prevent destructive behaviors and promote healthy teamwork.
  Transcript:
  Patrick O'Shaughnessy
  You said something to me about the business, which I found so interesting, which is that you don't want diversity of values at ID.me. I want to ask a couple of questions about just the principles and the culture in that step four of the Steve Blank book and how you've thought about philosophically deploying those things. Maybe start with that one as an example and then riff on the other principles that you've established, like the one for business model there in building the business and the power of Those principles.
  Blake Hall
  And if you don't screen for it, you're in for a tough ride. So I think e pluribus unum, out of many one, this is the whole premise of America that what our country is struggling with right now, that everyone is welcome as long as you are committed To the fundamental American values of freedom, that you can criticize any religion, you can burn any book, and you will not be met with violence. People might have problems with that, just like I'll have a problem if you burn the American flag. But the fact that you can do that and not be harmed shows that you live in a free country. So when you let people in who fundamentally reject the premise of your country, your culture begins to suffer. Our country is suffering for that right now because we haven't been intentional about it. The same thing is true with the company. So right now, the whole country is struggling with this battle really between enlightenment values and postmodernism. And if you let that conflict into your company, it's like a wagon that has two hands pulling on the wheel. Is it merit or is it something else? What are we really focused on driving? For me, what I loved about the military, what I loved about growing up, what I loved about fairness and what my dad told me, three rules that his grandfather had given to him. And one of them was never think that you're better than the men that you lead. And that we come from different backgrounds. We come from different places, from different experiences, but we're all army green. And your job is to treat everyone fairly, according to the same standard. And that's what I loved about service, that if you listen to my guys talk to each other, part of you would be like, oh my God. But the other part would be like, these guys would all take a bullet for each other, they're brothers. And so true intimacy is being able to be open, not malicious, to love each other, joke and have a good time and not have folks throwing yellow cards because you said something just ridiculous. So if you want to move fast, you don't want ideological tension. I'm really deliberate about that. We published some value statements about our commitment to really classic liberalism. Everyone is equal before the law. It's not good or okay to be racist in any direction. And just like you would want your kids' elementary school teacher to treat everybody, not giving preference, but teaching kids about character and you're responsible for what you Do. And that's all that matters. Crazy to me that's even a question, but it's therefore even more important that you screen that out at the beginning. Once you move past ideology, you're looking for, I basically designed our cultural values around all the patterns that I'd seen across my time in the military about what makes for effective Teams. So you can imagine selection as a triangle where one point of the triangle is skills, one point of the triangle is capability, just raw sort of intellectual potential. The other one is your behaviors and habits. And you can hear this echo to Aristotle. We are what we do. Excellence, therefore, is not an act, but a habit. FBI profilers, the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior. We defined our cultural values. First rule is don't be a jerk. And what we mean by that specifically is if you are not emotionally self-regulated, if you can't control your fight or flight response, you're not welcome here. Because ultimately, that's when we do things that are really mean and cruel is when we go into fight or flight. And actually, there's a lot of research too, that shows that really good CEOs and rangers for that matter are able to move out of fight or flight very quickly. I had this briefing after ranger school from a Delta Force recruiter who showed us the cortisol profile of a ranger graduate versus general public. And he's like, here's the profile of somebody who's exposed like a life and death traumatic event. And it's three or four days before it goes back to normal. Here's the profile of ranger school graduates. And it was like a 30 to 45 minute rebound effect that after near life and death, you and I could be talking like this and it's fine. So anyways, so there's that there's always compete with the grid. We don't hire pessimists here. We love critical thinkers, but we want optimists who can believe in a contrarian point of view if they have first principles conviction. I think you want to be really intentional about that to make sure that as you scale, you don't end up sideways. And you need only look at Paul Graham and the whole Google Gemini thing was going on where you want an image of George Washington and God forbid, show an actual historically accurate Picture of George Washington. That's a great example of if you emphasize things other than truth and merit and excellence, you end up with pretty bizarre outcomes. I've been pretty ruthless about enforcing culture because I know what it is to be in an intimate, close team where everyone's treated fairly as an individual, don't care about anything Else other than performance. And I want that for everyone who works here. It's a wonderful environment. It's what I loved about the military and what I'm really passionate about enforcing here at IDME as well.

- **Strata of Thinking**
  * Different people think at different levels of abstraction, called 'strata'.
  * Linear thinkers focus on tactical details, while conceptual thinkers consider broader implications and interconnectedness.
  * Systems-level thinkers reject initial framing to identify the underlying core issues, thinking across larger time horizons.
  * Recognizing these strata is crucial for effective leadership and communication, enabling empathetic understanding of team members' cognitive processes.
  * Think complexly across systems.
  Transcript:
  Patrick O'Shaughnessy
  I love it. On the topic of performance, you turned me on to something I hadn't heard of before, which is this stratum concept behind levels of leadership. Can you explain what that is and how you found it useful?
  Blake Hall
  Our brains hear the same words, but it interprets it into different meanings. So maybe the easiest example would be like if you asked Thomas Jefferson or your average high school student about what's the purpose of education, you would get two very different Answers. Jefferson's going to be talking to you about how an enlightened citizenry is indispensable for the proper functioning of a republic. The high schooler is probably talking to you about whether they should go to vocational school or whether they should get a bachelor's degree or join the military. It's very tactical. And so at root, what you're screening for is you're screening for linear versus conceptual thinkers. And what's amazing is that, so for our overall selection, we have the triangle, which is skills capability. It's sort of your habits and expressed values in terms of behavior. Maybe your childhood, we can fix a lot of things. I can't fix your childhood. So we want to screen for that. Then for executives, you have, it's really like the cognitive equivalent of speed. And so people talk a lot about systems level thinkers, well, what do they mean? So the first thing you want to do is you want to separate linear from conceptual thinkers. And so this theory of strata, and we have these two trained psychologists that administer interview tests, you could ask a Rorschach block question like, what do you think about a bachelor's Degree? Should we legalize cannabis? Do you think that it's okay to paint your house pink or that you have to buckle up when you drive? And what's amazing is that thematically, you will get similar answers from the same person at a certain level of thinking. So for example, if you ask somebody about buckling up when you drive or painting your house pink, they might say like, yeah, it's annoying, but it keeps you safe. And I think it makes sense. And people should buckle up more often. You're in a conversation about buckling up when you drive, and we should probably be more responsible about that. The systems level thinker will have a totally different answer. They'll be like, that's bullshit because it's the same question. So they reject the frame first. They go, what we're really talking about are what are the limits of individual freedoms when it comes to some broader impact on the surrounding community or public. And so maybe let's just talk about that. You could talk about cigarettes in public too, right? So let's talk about that. And now you're into a completely different conversation. So what's true thematically is true systems level thinkers, they think over different time horizons. So think about Elon Musk. He's thinking over millennia. He wants to make humans multi-planetary and all of his actions day to day are guided by this overriding mission to get folks to Mars as a broader bridge to being a multi-planetary resilient Species. Who thinks over, and when you think about your CEOs of oil and gas companies and everything else, and they're riding these broad macroeconomic trends responsible for geopolitical Dynamics across different cultures, they have to be good at so many different things. And so what's remarkable is stratum four is the shift from linear thinking to conceptual thinking. The thing about stratum four is they'll be able to start to feel concepts, but they wouldn't be able to go to a whiteboard and explain to you how they influence each other. For us, stratum four is where we want our VPs to be who are on the road. Keep in mind, it takes maybe five to 10 years to move from one stratum to the next. Stratum five is when you can not only see concepts, but if you went up to the whiteboard, you could organize them and you can make it really simple. That's where you go, hey guys, it's really this. This influences all this other stuff. And so what you'll typically find with like stratum four thinkers is just a lot of detail. But what you'll continually have to go back to is, hey, listen, I love the math. I love the work. What's the headline synthesis? If you find yourself talking for like, like, look at this Excel spreadsheet, and they haven't taken the time to just give you the headline number, you're probably talking to a stratum Three or a stratum four worker. And it's just how their brain works. Stratum fives were simple. And then stratum six and seven is where you start to deal with like how concepts influence other concepts, you're thinking over very long time horizons. So to be on our executive team, you have to be at least stratum five because you have to take a very complicated thing and make it clear. And I just noticed that as we were scaling, I would have different conversations with different executives. The higher stratum ones would come to me and be like, Blake, I got 99 problems. Everything's burning, but these are the three that matter. Here's how I see. If we execute on this, it hits that. Is that a line? And I'm like, yeah, that's aligned. Or if it's not, we just revise it a little bit, we go. The other ones, I'd be like, what are you working on? And then you go, what's important? Well, all of it's important. And I'd break through, I'd be like, actually, these things are grouped under that. And this is under that. And what I was actually doing, we had a chief people officer with background and talent. He had spent some time at Bridgewater. He would actually be able to predict what would happen after I had conversations with executives. I'm like, I couldn't make it more simple. He's like, that's not what he heard though, because his brain works a different way. He just heard you giving him more work and he doesn't know how to approach it in a more creative way, in a way that scales. It was to the point where it was consistent enough. I was like, what am I missing? And so now that we screened for that, it's remarkably predictive. I think the closing thing is it teaches you to be much more empathetic because I believe that most people show up to work trying to do a good job, working their best. Once you understand stratum and how their brain works and whether if they can see the field or not, a physical analogy would be like if you had a sports coach that asked kids to sprint and There was like, Tommy's running as hard as he can, but he's slow. And the coach was like, Tommy, if you only cared, if you tried harder, you'd be fast. The kid would be like, what the hell? That's just mean. So once you understand it's not a effort thing, it's not a trying thing, it's a capability thing. Their brain doesn't work like yours works. It's cruel to try to do it because it's immutable. You can't train for it. It's literally, it's like your whole life, you're grooved into this pattern and it changes very slowly. So I think honestly, that assessment, as well as getting the skills assessment, culture kind of takes care of itself over time. If you bring in a jerk and nobody in the company is a jerk, those people get put on an island pretty quick. It's like an immune system response, but it's so hard. And the most common mistake that I've made is to promote and over title people, not realizing that doing a great job just means hanging on title and hyper growth because the business Is growing faster than most people. And that has its own thing where folks who would be fine in one position when they're over titled, they become insecure and realize...
