  So on more than one occasion, Hedy, as a single individual, bailed out the city of New York. And the reason I think it was important to read two books on her is because we're dealing with a very singular individual here. You have to keep in mind at a time when women weren't even allowed to vote, Hedy was the single biggest individual financier in the world. And so I just want to give you a brief overview before I go into her childhood because I thought her childhood and the education she received from her family was very fascinating. She refused. One of my favorite things about her, this is mentioned in both books multiple times is she refused to comply with any type of stereotype. There was a description of Hedy by another person that I absolutely loved. They said Hedy was defiantly independent, that she made her own rules and lived by them. It made me think when I got to have dinner with Charlie Munger, I asked him what he thought of Jeff Bezos. And Munger described Bezos, one of the best ways I've heard anybody described. He says that Jeff was ferociously intelligent. And so this idea of combining ferocious intelligence with being defiantly independent, I absolutely loved. And this is a great quote that will give you a sense of Hedy's personality. And she said, I've had fights with some of the greatest financial men in the country. Did you ever hear of any of them getting ahead of Hedy Green? And she had a personal motto that she lived by. It says, I go my own way, I take no partners, and I risk nobody else's fortune. Again, she ([Time 0:04:31](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c20c5121-0ab2-4051-a49d-6bec1608f899))
- She learned from history and saw the behavior of others during panics, which informed her of what to do for the next panics. Very independent. Important not to be in a hurry to get Rich. Despite working by her father side Her father doesn’t trust her to invest the family money brings in and outside investor or his will. She only can invest the cash flow from investments. This pisses her off entire life, but using this cash should becomes the richest, self-made person in the world. Turned a few 100k into 100mm. She saw herself as fiercely alone and trusted no one. Hates consensus. Had very simple routine. She was one of the first to go to work last to leave but left work at home. She refused to have an office working on the middle of the floor with others. Never even had an assistant wanted to see everything at the ground floor. Loved investing. Didn’t allow filters she did deep research and would only invest once she knew everything deeply. Loved work it was her duty. Business was her pleasure. Make what you love your work. Didn’t care about others opinions or society created her own rules trusted herself over everyone. Trusted her own, thinking lives by her own life. Lived life only on her own terms. Trust her own judgement. Her strategy was just going against belief buying low and selling high.

  J.P. Morgan told his son, there was a good lesson to be learned from other people's greed and good bargains to be found in the aftermath. In future times, Hedy would always keep cash available and use it to buy when everyone else was selling. Much later, Warren Buffett would do the same, but most people watched their money wash away in the flood. This pattern will repeat throughout her life. There's another example a ([Time 0:18:44](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1a022800-348c-4bde-b30b-17f304315a9b))
- She makes all of her money buying cheap obvious things. After the Civil War American bonds went to 40 or $.50 which she saw is ridiculous and bought up as much as she could. She would also buy mortgages and take over in foreclosure never actually bought real estate, but had a giant Empire through this tactic. She always moves in silence. She says undervalued railroad starts buying quietly a company. Does nothing. She seizes opportunities because she does so much work ahead of time. Then she has the balls to hold on to her position until her thesis plays out. She bought something at $70 saw it go to $100 but knew there were more catalysts ended up getting out at $127.5. Her independence is what makes her an amazing investor. She rode the wave of the railroads. She starts teaching her kids business from their infancy. Trains them always. Best way to learn is by starting low. At 22 she gives her son a small job on the railroad so he could learn from the front. She taught her kids self reliance. Then when he’s 24 and he’s proven himself, she buys a railroad and puts him in charge. This is a failing railroad and becomes a test to see if he can actually run a railroad and make it profitable so he can level up.

  So she has this one trade that she does shortly after her father dies. She's trading in greenbacks. So it says she was already establishing the patterns of investment that would define her career, sticking with conservative instruments such as United States bonds and having the Cool head to stay on course when others had panicked. So she starts buying up United States greenback notes. The government had printed, the United States government had printed large quantities of these notes right after the Civil War to try to cover some of its huge expenditures. So at the time, the Union had just won a huge military victory, but people were very scared and really just doubtful about the future economic prospects of this country that's trying To put itself back together. As a result, there's this huge rush to the safety of gold, and the value of greenbacks wind up dropping as low as 40 to 50 cents on the dollar. Hedy sees everybody else panicking and flaying greenbacks for gold. And so you know what she does. She's going to want to buying greenbacks. Essentially what she's doing, she's buying dollars for 40 or 50 cents. There's a great description of this trade from this book called The Men of Wealth. And it says, here was an excellent chance for any far-seeing person to pick up government securities at half their value. All it required was little faith in the nation that had just demonstrated in a most extraordinary way its ability to come through a terrific civil war. Looking back at it now, the recovery of the country ought to have seemed a sure thing to any observer. The war had given an immense impetus to the resources of the continent. So all these natural resources are going to have huge, essentially, booms in all these natural resources like coal, iron, oil, copper, gold, and silver. But for all that, the nation's credit was at a low ebb. And through 1865, 1866, 1867, Hedy bought all the government bonds she could lay a hold of. So she ran her playbook with greenbacks and government bonds. She does the exact same thing for real estate. She is going to build a gigantic real estate empire, portfolio. Most of this real estate she's going to acquire happens during financial panics. You can think of Hedy, again, remember, the largest single individual financier in the entire world. That sentence breaks my brain. It just blows my mind. You really think of Hedy as a one-woman private bank. So it goes back to what her father told her to do when she was young, you have to keep a fortress of cash. She is going to use that to buy real estate out of foreclosure. So banks in need of cash would sell Hedy loans, mortgages, that they had made to other people using property as collateral. Some of these borrowers are going to default on their loans. Hedy began to acquire the property for the mortgages, right? This was the beginning of what's going to become this gigantic real estate empire. So she's going to wind up owning dozens of buildings in block after block in New York, Chicago, St. Louis, and Boston. Most of them were acquired because they were through foreclosure on the mortgages that she held. She rarely, if ever, bought a property outright on the open market. And once she owned a property, she held onto it. That is repeated over and over again. Hedy's philosophy on real estate was very simple. Hold onto property. So I actually found an interview that took place, think, in New Yorker magazine. Let me check. It's 1836. Yeah, it was in October 22nd, 1938. Sorry. In New Yorker magazine. It is describing, and I actually looked it up and read the whole thing. It's describing an interview that Hedy gave about 30 something years earlier in 1899. Okay. So I pulled a quote from this interview of hers in 1899 that describes her real estate portfolio. She says, I have mortgages on 28 churches and on four cemeteries. I have blocks of business houses, theaters, library stables, hotels, restaurants, farms, and nearly everything you could imagine. Five years ago, I started out to take a look at all these buildings. So she's like, I got to go see all the property that I own all over the country. I traveled for nearly two years and stayed at 40 hotels. So I think that gives you an insight into like the sheer scope of her real estate portfolio that it took her two years and 40 different hotels just to see all of it. Okay. So we see Hedy running her playbook in government bonds, in greenbacks, in real estate. She also does this. She's going to invest in railroads and then she's going to wind up buying some railroads outright. But I want to give you an example of how Hedy worked and how she applied this playbook to the most important industry of her day. She hears about this takeover attempt of this small railroad called the Georgia Central Railroad. And I think it's an important example for you and I to study because it really gives us a glimpse into the tactics and style that she's going to use over and over again for the rest of her Career. So it starts out with a group of wealthy investors in New York. They start studying the Georgia Central Railroad. They're like, hey, this is a ripe takeover opportunity. And they just thought there's a bunch of assets inside the railroad that the railroad also owned that was not being properly accounted for. One of this was a steamship line. And so since the steamship line, they figured had been really undervalued among the railroad's assets. ([Time 0:28:25](https://share.snipd.com/snip/95ae67c7-7b1d-4c6f-9853-1ca2869c2d8d))
- Her son when he takes over the railroad is always calling her asking questions questions and she rejects these telling him he must make his own decisions and be self-reliant. Whale captain parable he always drives the boat when he dies his kids are clueless. You need to figure things out yourself and trust yourself. He learns incrementally they’re slow improvement. Never kicks a person when you’re down. She was a one woman federal reserve. When New York needed money, she landed below market rates to not be extractive and save them in the tough time. Good business relationship. newspapers instead of the saying federal reserve cutting rates hetty would cut rates. She was frugal and moved in almost complete silence. She would buy things under fake names. Always had more stocks than people thought. She watched her pennies and the dollar took care of themselves. She couldn’t afford cabs rode public transport with 100k in stock certificates.

  So every time he's faced with a business decision, he would immediately send her telegraph and like, what do I do? What do I do? And she would send back a very terse response. You're on the ground. Mind your own business. She would make him make the decision. And he was so nervous and he became so frustrated that he winds up going, catching a train and going back to New York to see her. And I love what she does here in this situation. So they're in New York. And she goes, suppose I was not here. What would you do if I was dead? You have to be self-reliant. So she tells, she winds up telling her son this, it's an old wailing parable that she learned when she ([Time 0:41:18](https://share.snipd.com/snip/be67364c-564b-4c7e-80d4-a5620b187752))
- She never said about anything that she couldn’t conquer. Warned against marrying a man with a rich family who had never worked hard to accomplish anything. During financial panics men come to her in droves to sell her their stuff for cheap. She had a mom instinct and she kept a revolver on her desk. When someone threatened her kid in business, she referenc out her gun on the desk. Gives kid lists of don’t. You have to neglect things to accomplish anything because of focus.

  She gave her children a list of don'ts. So again, this is going to remind me and you of Munger. In fact, I think I discovered, originally discovered Hedy Green because Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger had studied her. But that idea that Munger said that you invert, always invert, that you can actually, like Munger, Hedy studied the cause of human failure and folly and then just avoided that. And so here's the list of don'ts that she wanted to pass on to her children. Don't cheat in any of our business dealings, for sooner or later your conscience will trouble you and you'll worry yourself into an early grave. Don't fail to be fair in all things, business and otherwise. Don't kick a man when he's down. Don't envy your neighbors. Don't over-address whether you have the means or not. This causes envy. That's another interesting thing that she had in common with Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger, the fact that they both said that greed doesn't drive the world, envy does, and that You have to cure yourself of envy because envy is a weakness. Don't fail to go to church for the church needs you and you need the They were Quakers. Don't forget that riches dishonorably gained must be left behind someday. And when you depart, you will find the gates of heaven bolted against you. Don't forget to be charitable and don't falsify. And then when she was 80 years old, right before she dies, she gives more advice. When it comes to spending your life, there have to be some things neglected. If you try to do too much, you'll never get anywhere. And so when you actually study the traits of not only how she lived her life, but especially, it was very fascinating, the conversations that she was having with her son and her daughter, Because we know how important the conversations and the upbringing for the multiple generations that came before her were to Hedy. And really, you can identify the reverse of the stuff that she was trying to get them to avoid. The mirror image of that are the traits that she winds up admiring. And a lot of these traits she possessed herself. So I just wrote, I was just like sketching out like how, how can I like distill the model of Hedy in my own mind and based on her actions and which was important to her. So Hedy was simple, resourceful, focused on compounding for the long-term, frugal, focused, and paranoid. Very, very paranoid. Traits that Hedy valued in herself and others, solid, secure, sober, frugal, conservative, and prosperous. And before she died, she left behind a list of maxims. Here's a few of them. Before deciding on an investment, seek out every kind of information about it. And the second one, watch your pennies and the dollars will take care of themselves. The third one, after your business is over, you may take your colleague to dinner or the theater or allow him to take you, but wait until the transaction has been closed and the money paid. She understood incentives. She understood the deep desire for humans to reciprocate. This is why you see like people like Sam Walton and other people, they would not let any of their salespeople or any of their buyers take any kind of gifts. You see the echo in the knowledge that Hedy's trying to depart to her, impart to her children. Number four, before making a deal, if anyone is full enough to offer you the full amount, take it. If you are offered less, tell the man you will give him the answer in the morning. Think the matter over carefully. If you decide overnight, it's just what she's saying, sleep on it. If you decide that it would be to your advantage to accept the offer, say so the next day. So the very next maxim, she repeats that again. In business generally, do not close a bargain until you have reflected on it overnight. Here's another one. When good things are so low that no one wants them, buy them and lay them away in the safe. When owning to some new development and that makes them go up and they're needed, that other men will pay well for them, then you sell. And finally, I am always buying when everyone wants to sell and selling when everyone wants to buy. And finally, I think this is a great description of Hetty to close on. She was an enigma, a blue-blooded Harris who identified with the common folk, a female who triumphed in the male world of finance, an independent who answered to no one but herself, A renegade and a moneymaker who thumbed her nose up at what money could buy. She used her intelligence to increase her wealth, her independence to live as she wished, and her strength to battle anyone who stood in her way. And that is where I'll leave it for the full story.
