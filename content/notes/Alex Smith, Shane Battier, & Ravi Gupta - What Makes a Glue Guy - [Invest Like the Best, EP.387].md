- Trust and Mission Focus Fuel Team Success
  Summary:
  Successful teams thrive on high levels of trust and a focused mission.
  Trust allows team members to communicate openly and provide immediate feedback, fostering a supportive environment where everyone commits to shared goals. A strong leader is crucial in creating trust by removing uncertainty and clearly defining roles.
  In challenging situations, teams that maintain trust and mission focus excel while those that lack these qualities often crumble.
  Individual motivation plays a key role; great teams are driven by selflessness and the desire to be part of something larger, enabling members to overcome personal doubts.
  The journey to achieving team goals often involves confronting and addressing self-doubt and external pressures, which can hinder performance and enjoyment of the game. A healthy perspective, coupled with fearlessness and selflessness, can lead to transformation and success, especially when guided by inspiring leadership.

  Speaker 2
  Yeah, I know. But thinking about the threads, the common threads between those teams, and something I talk a lot about with anyone who will listen is, those teams are marked by high trust and high What I call mission focus. Right? The trust was instant. We were able to talk to each other, look each other in the eye, and the feedback was instantaneous. Because we trusted we all had each other's back, we had the best interest, because we were here for one reason, and that was to raise a banner. And that's where the mission focus comes in. And everyone is rowing in the same direction. And when you have an environment, and from the coach, from the teams to the managers, assistant coaches, everybody associated with that run has ultimate trust and ultimate focus on Why we're here. Amazing, amazing things happen. And you don't understand that until adversity hits. And that's the other common theme, right? I've been on some great teams when adversity hits, they crumble because they lack mission focus, because they lack trust. And so you never know when you're going to have to lean on those two things, but those are the two most important factors in the successful cohesive team.
  Speaker 4
  Maybe just to pick on the first example you said, what allowed that trust to exist at that Duke team? Like what was the trust is great. I think everyone wants that and it's an amazing feeling, but how did you get it?
  Speaker 2
  Well, Coach K obviously is my mind, the greatest basketball coach, greatest coach in sports. And there are a lot of things that cause uncertainty in teams or cause mistrust. Uncertainty is one of them. When you have a strong leader that, that removes uncertainty and look, Coach K did a great job of defining roles, but also given a space to, to take ownership in the team. And there was no doubt every day we walked into the locker room why we were there. All right? And that's to be the best team possible to improve every single day. And if we do that, championships and winnings are a byproduct of that. Right? And so we were almost freed by expectations. Everyone said, was it a super high pressure? No, it wasn't high pressure because it was very simple daily goals of getting better, playing together, trusting each other, looking each other in the eye. It sounds super corny, but that was the expectation. And the uncertainty was removed from why we were there.
  Speaker 1
  We're free. Alex, what team came to mind for you? Thinking back to my college days, like that, you know, and I played for Urban, who was a, you know, I would almost call like a psychologist as much as a coach. And I think there's a, there's certainly selflessness is one of the first things that comes to mind. And I think where you could put that with trust right like the mission focus like the team's bigger than us right and everybody thinks that. For any great team, right? That again, they, and you want that. And I think at the core of everybody, you want to be a part of something bigger than yourself, right? Like, that's why you're there. That's why you're willing to sacrifice and do so much. And I think at the core of that comes the motivation from a good place. And I'm fascinated around motivation because I grew up and I never imagined in my wildest dreams I'd play professional sports. I was like too realistic a kid, right? Like I just heard the odds. It's not in the cards for me. I grew up a very normal kid. I wasn't like a crazy standout by any means growing up. And I had one college scholarship offer, right? And that was my dream. My dream growing up, like I loved Saturdays. Like I loved college football. I loved, again, getting your education, the idea of the student athlete running out on the field and like the student section going crazy and that relationship with the student section. And we're all part of this great big culture that we've been craving, right? And you're just a role in that and getting your education and obviously then moving, you know, with your life. And like one school gave me that opportunity. And there certainly when I got there was this, you know, I had it along with probably everybody else there that like, were we good enough, right? Like was I deserving of this? Was I good enough? And certainly we all embodied that. And this comes back to urban, we all had an edge. The entire team had an edge, had something to prove. And so I took the field with a fearlessness every single game like, like, you know, I like fuck you like I, you know, excuse my language, like I'm, I'm out here to do something, right? And I don't care, I wasn't worried about making a mistake. No one was expecting anything anyway. I think we played with an edge as a team and were out to do something. We were a little school in the Mountain West. At the time they had this PCS thing and we wanted to be the first school. They didn't allow us in the club and we wanted to break the wall down. And that was the goal, and everybody was rowing in the same direction. And you woke up with a singular focus every day that that's what we wanted to go do, and it was important to all of us. And then to go achieve it, obviously, you know, it's like the best feeling in sports, right, to be accountable. Like to quickly flip on that, it was, you know, it was only months later that I got drafted with the number one overall pick. And everything changed for me. Everything changed. Right? And like that courage that I took the field with, that fearlessness that our entire team embodied, like I didn't have that anymore. And in fact, I was on the other side of it. Like I was the expectations were so great. I Had so much self-doubt Right that like I was in over my head that and I was Scared to death like I thought I had to be perfect and I was scared to death to make a mistake and I walked out Onto The field I did and I did everything not just on the field. Like I everything tiptoed around on eggshells.
  Speaker 4
  It was so burdensome, the weight that I walked around in, and it never left. Can you zoom in on that a little bit? I suspect almost nobody has experienced this sort of external pressure that you had and you're talking about like the world, you know, watching and aware of your performance. But I also suspect that basically everyone listening has had some period of extraordinary self-doubt and it's hard to get through. Zoom in on like the emotions and like what that was literally like. Like, did you feel that in the shower? Did you feel that lying in bed?
  Speaker 1
  Do you have trouble sleeping? Like how did it manifest? All the time. Yeah. Laying in bed at night, having dinner with my friends or girlfriend at the time who became my wife Certainly at the facility and ([Time 0:15:11](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9d6ef0f0-dfb9-45c0-ab1a-af54df08df49))
    - **Note:** Teams rely on trust and openness. High trust cultures. What makes great teams. Commitment bigger than yourself. Selflessness team before us. Bigger than yourself. Right kind of motivation. Alex had an amazing loving team in college but being the first pick in the nfl scared him to death and didn’t allow him to suceeed. Put too much weight of expectations on his shoulders. Dealing with doubt and the voices in your head and minimizing your emotions instead of confronting your emotions and embracing them. Hitting rock bottom emotional hardship. He wanted to validate people and couldn’t. Healthy perspective and motivation. Don’t block self doubt having the right mentors. You need the right people to come into your life when you need them and where who love you trust you for you and enable you to actively be more.
- Joy Fuels Success
  Summary:
  Success is intertwined with joy and enjoyment in the process.
  Engaging with tasks should not mean sacrificing fun for productivity; rather, both can coexist. Emphasizing a culture of joy nurtures this balance.
  In challenging situations, such as sports, adversity becomes a catalyst for growth and teamwork.
  Building trust among teammates and leadership can convert difficult moments into opportunities for resilience.
  Specific strategies, like adapting to change and emphasizing teamwork, help navigate hardship. There's an understanding that success often emerges from rigorous preparation in anticipation of challenges. Reflecting on difficult experiences reveals personal and collective growth, teaching valuable lessons about perseverance, teamwork, and the importance of maintaining morale. Embracing challenges with a positive outlook makes the journey meaningful, ensuring that joy is a part of the hard work leading to achievement.

  And that like really sat with me, because like I like think a lot about where I'm spending my time and why am I gone from my family and all these things. And Scott always looked like he was enjoying himself. And that always sat with me, it's like, well, man, this could be fun. We can get important things done, but it doesn't have to be that we don't like each other or enjoy it. And that is a part of who I am. I like laughing, I like doing that. And certainly if I'm gonna spend a lot of time somewhere, I need it to be fun. So one of the things that was cool about Instacart for me was I got to put my stamp on the culture, right? It wasn't just a culture that I had to like, join in. And one of my favorite parts was I felt like we had joy in the culture. And that's what when I hear Alex talk about his moments, like, it's just like football stops being fun. Well, it's like, man, that's like really sad. Like, you're never gonna be great if there's not like some joy to it.
  Speaker 4
  I'd love to zoom in on the on the hard part, because I was kind of distinctive the other two answers I was with Kareem our friend Kareem yesterday from thrive and he has this beautiful idea Which is that small ideas attract a lot of competition and Because they're easier to do and so people you know, that's kind of default like something simple and easy Whereas like SpaceX Or something not a lot of SpaceX competitors because it's insanely impossibly hard. And I'd love to hear examples that come to mind from each of you or from anyone on what that means in practice. So, you know, working with Coach K or on whatever team we're talking about, like, zoom in on the hard, like, help us understand what hard feels like or looks like in practice or in a moment.
  Speaker 2
  I think about the hardest time in my four years at Duke was my last game at home against University of Maryland. It's my senior night, we lose. Not only that, our all ACC center, future pro, future 15 year pro and center, Carlos Buzer, breaks his foot. Okay? So we lose for our arrival, we lose our center, starting center for what seems like the rest of the year. Okay? We have one game left against North Carolina, our vaunted rival. And at that moment, you know, I came back, I could have gone into the NBA early, I came back for a championship run. At that moment, it was the first time I ever had pity for myself. And of course, all the haters came out in the media and the fans, Duke's dead, no boozer, no chance. They can't beat Carolina. I think Alex has a tweet on that, something like 2000 and one. Yeah. And so we actually went to practice the next day, and we're all moping around and Coach K boots us out of practice Boot kicks us out says get out of my gym come back when you're ready to practice Alright, so we go in the locker room and I'm throwing chairs and I said guys you don't understand like you you're all you guys are All super young you have more chances. This is it for me conceivably we could get blown up by Carolina We could go to ACC tournament lose that game and then losing in the first round to a 16th seed, and my career is over, and I have Nothing to show for it. And I'm emotional and crying. I'm pretty slow at God, but I'm crying. And I said, we're better than this. This is not who we are. And so we composed ourselves and went back out to the court and said, hey, coach, we're ready to practice. And Coach K looked us in the eye and said, I'm going to ask every one of you a question. And I want you to answer from your heart. And he asked this, do you trust me? And do you trust in my plan? And if you do, we will win a national championship. Laughs. We just lost boozer. You know, it's not looking good for the home team here. Coach Kate went down the line, looked at something, and I said, do you believe in me? Do you believe in my plan? Do you believe we'll be national champions? And we all said yes. And after that, he unleashed this brand new plan. We played super small. We inserted Reggie Love, who was more famously Obama's body man, as a 6'5 center who guarded Brendan Haywood, who was giving away 8 inches and 200 pounds to him the next game. And we were going to shoot 53 pointers, overwhelm them with speed and 3 point shooting. Okay? And it was a brilliant plan that no one saw coming. And to coach Kay's point, he said, look, we are built for this moment. We're not going to win the national championship because we changed something right now. We're going to win the national championship because our habits are pure and we are preparing for this single hard moment and nobody flinched. Right? And that's the difference. Again, it's like the analogy of pounding the rock. You just don't know when that rock is going to break. You don't know what is going to be the differentiator when you face that adversity. And so it was the old next man up, Reggie Logue gets inserted into the lineup. We go to Carolina, we beat them by 12. All right, we go to the ACC Championship, win the ACC Championship, go to the NCAA Tournament. Carlos Bouser miraculously comes back from a broken foot and we win the National Championship and our average margin of victory was 12 points. We beat every team we played by double digits. To your point, Ravi, like, yes, it's more meaningful in its heart. Yes. Right. And when there's risk, when there's risk involved, and you're, for us, for the athletes, you know, I was at risk of losing face. Yeah. And being embarrassed that I lost my last three games to some chumps. Right. And here I am this guy, but I couldn't get it done. But again, it wasn't about me. It was about our journey. It was about our team and what did we need to do to adapt a change to the adversity to get to our ultimate goal, which we did. And now, you know, look, the winners read the history books. So it's a great story now. It wasn't very fun. We were going through it, but it's something that, you know, Coach K is famous for. And I'm a better person, man, father, husband, because I went through that experience.
  Speaker 1
  Isn't it always like that though? Like in hindsight, when you're in the middle of it, and I like, this is like the, I always find it funny, I love like the office space thing, right? Like when the guy's talking about how do you know what you're supposed to do in life? And it's like well the question is the counselor questions like well if you had a million dollars, then what would you do? And the guy's like nothing You know like I would just do nothing. I Think there's this false sense that like we'll do what you love Like that idea of love and that you should all just be like super enjoyable. I don't I totally like I completely agree, Robbie, like it has to be hard, like that has to be inherent in it. You know, that there has to be something at risk to go try to take that on and the potential to fail.
  Speaker 2
  I think if you're crazy enough, there is joy in the misery or the grudge.
  Speaker 1
  I mean, you have a patch on your backpack that says, embrace the suck. ([Time 0:33:53](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d188d832-25b1-4bde-9993-0bec427044d9))
    - **Note:** Good teams and jobs give you energy. Follow your heart. Doing something hard leads to less competition. Doing hard things and believing in yourself. It has to be hard you need to take risk there is joy in misery.
- Live Fearlessly, Lead Boldly
  Summary:
  The importance of mentorship and the profound impact of teammates on personal growth and performance is highlighted through specific experiences.
  One individual's journey from feeling lost and overwhelmed to finding inspiration in a hardworking third-string linebacker exemplifies the effect of living fearlessly and embracing challenges. This player's infectious energy and courageous mindset served as a catalyst to shift the focus from fear to living fully in the moment.
  Similarly, experiences in a competitive basketball environment emphasize how senior teammates set standards through their actions, promoting resilience, positivity, and an uncomplaining attitude.
  These instances underscore the value of team culture, where unspoken traditions and standards foster a collaborative spirit, encouraging individuals to strive for excellence and uplift one another.
  Mentorship emerges as a vital component of team dynamics, shaping not only performance but also individual character and identity within the group, ultimately leading to enduring success.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I can do that and like so I would just I Remember like Wednesday nights and Thursday nights like I would just be in the film room till like 9 10 at night watching and I had No idea what I was Doing. I just wasting time right like and I was by myself Okay, the other two QBs at the time had combined one start and like we're at home at four o'clock And like I remember like just being there Watching film on myself and just having no idea what I was doing and it not helping right and I still got there and just like suck and And and I felt very alone okay very alone in that and so That I you asked about teammates and I think there's definitely a teammate that had the most profound impact on my career and this was in hindsight his name is Blake Costanzo. I told these guys this story. Like, he was a third string linebacker. He, again, I don't know what college he went to. If you looked at him, if you ran into him on the street, you would have no idea he played professional football. Like he didn't look the part at all. And he was on every special teams, right? Like he was on kickoff, return, kickoff, punt, punt, return. And every team has these guys, there's like five of them that are on all these core special teams. Because they're all backups, they're not starters, they're on offensive or defense, they don't get any limelight, nobody knows their names. And Blake, man, like loved what he did. Like loved running down on kickoff. And it's this just crazy play, right? Like they outlawed it for a while. And he loved it. And like just came to practice every day with like an energy and and like a joy. And again, before games, right, like I told you guys, like, that's when I was at my worst, like sitting on my stool, just like, you know, in my own head, worrying. Blake there before games, again, as we creep towards kickoff, just would like be, the energy level would just go up. And he would run around, he had to sing, and he would run around the locker room, and he would like literally get in guy's face, like he'd come over. And be like, Shane, are you going to live today? Because I'm gonna live. Right, and I remember sitting there, I'm the quarterback, I'm the number one overall pick, and I'm so worried, again, and I've been pretending that this isn't hard, right, that I, again, And here's this guy, I mean, third string linebacker, and he is confronting the problem, right? Man. This thing is hard What we're doing and I'm gonna go out there despite all of that, right? I'm gonna live on the other side of the coin like the courage side again, and I was in the fear kind of side if there were two mindsets and I would go watch him and he's like By no means was he Perfect but man he played fearless. Like, and it was his, more than the words, although I love that, you know, are you going to live? But like, it was how he went about it, right? And how he lived his life and how he attacked the problem. That was the biggest example and had a huge profound effect on me. And like, it became this challenge to myself that like, I stole from him. And I was like, are you are you gonna live like, man, are you going to be present because you've been, you've been gone for six years like you've been out there on the field, but you're not There. And if you probably had no idea, in fact, I've talked about it, I know he had no idea the effect he had on me at the time. And I think that's the cool thing when I try to talk like the power of teams. And this is again, to kind of bring it I guess full circle, I get asked all the time about the Mahomes mentoring him, why'd you do it? And like I do go back to I was alone in those meeting rooms, like watching film and had no idea what I was doing. And it sucked. And like, Patrick and I, and it wasn't any I didn't whisper any like words. Yeah, like that's just not, he got a front row view right alongside me to go see all those things, to watch me watch film, to watch me prepare to play a game, to like, you know, all the little Things. And so, and that's what mentorship is, you know, as a side of, as a part of being a teammate.
  Speaker 2
  I mean, I'm thinking about the exact same thing you are. The aspect of mentorship on a team is something that is not talked about enough. And there was a moment in my career that I can point to. I was a freshman, a hotshot freshman at Duke University. And here I was, I was National Player of the Year, you know, with number one recruiting class, with number one team in the season, going into the season, okay. Elton Brand and all these guys. Our preseason training was really difficult. All right, part of our success was we were in some better shape than every team. And there was one particular drill called a 17 across. And the 17 across was 17 wits of the basketball court in one minute. Okay? And if one person missed, put 60 seconds back on the clock and run it again. So like I used to have nightmares about this. So I'll never forget going over from Cameron indoor stadium to card gymnasium where we practice in head conditioning. And I said to nobody in particular, man, I hate 17 across. And just then our senior captain, Steve Wojcicki, woe-jo to the lay person, all right? All five foot eight of them stops, turns around, looks at me and says, you know what I hate? Losing. Man, I felt yay big. I felt yay big. And in one little moment, I understood what it was to be a member of the Duke basketball team. And it started with no complaining, right? And I started just to take all my cues from the senior leadership on that team, the Steve Wojajowski's, the Trajan Langdon's, the Rashawn McClouds, just how they carried themselves. They were Duke basketball, you know? Regardless of what I accomplished in high school and all the fanfare I came in with my freshman class. I wanted to be like them. And they set the standard. They were the first ones there. They were the last ones to leave. They never complained. They always showed strength. They never showed that they were maybe anxiety ridden, always confident. Man, yeah, I want to be like Trajan. I want to be like Wojo. And then funny thing happens, you get older, you find yourself, you know, you're the senior captain and you feel this, this duty to teach the younger guys, guys like Carlos Bouser and Jason Williams and Mike Dunley, you come behind you. This is what it means to be part of this program, right? It's not about just winning games or making shots. It's about how you carry yourself, how we work, the lack of excuses, right? Look each other in the eye. And, you ([Time 0:41:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1dbd30e1-3709-4851-8843-ace5c9018d20))
    - **Note:** How to live and play fearlessly. People who feel like they allow you to run through a wall they’re deeply thege for you they make everything much easier. Being a good mentor and how you have mentors then become a mentor.
- Authentic Strength Lies in Vulnerability
  Summary:
  Real strength in leadership and teamwork comes from vulnerability, as demonstrated by respected leaders who face challenges openly and authentically.
  Displaying emotions during difficult moments fosters a deeper connection among teammates and showcases genuine character. Leaders who can express their fears and struggles in real-time cultivate an environment where it is acceptable to feel overwhelmed.
  This contrasts with the traditional narrative that emphasizes stoicism and unwavering strength.
  Acknowledging personal challenges and the emotional toll of experiences not only normalizes vulnerability but also encourages openness among team members.
  The value of present-tense vulnerability is critical, as it invites ongoing dialogue about challenges rather than simply recounting past hardships.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Like, I don't know anybody that I consider strong that isn't vulnerable right like really that isn't real the best leaders that I knew the best teammate leaders that like there was nothing Worse than like, you know a team meeting or a team gathering or a breakdown and Freakin, you know Disney guy jumps in there and gives some rah-rah garbage, you know Like we everybody got A BS meter. The guys I respected the most, the leaders, whether they were coaches, teammates, peers, that were vulnerable and walked in and kept it real, right? And like whatever moment, you know, like the ups, the downs, the in-betweens, like I just think that that's what real strength is. Well, I disagree. I think I'm having a hard time coming up with an example of someone who is strong and vulnerable.
  Speaker 2
  I mean, we're taught to be like warriors out there. Like, like, like Coach K used to show us video of us if we were making a face towards the official, right? And he said, look, if you are showing that you're anxious or you're letting the officials affect the game, your opponents are saying, whoa, look at Duke. They're distracted. We got them. Right? And so it was always strong chin, strong face, strong face. And in athletics, like, look, you're in the locker room. You're letting out tears in the locker room. Because everyone's always looking at you. And if you're crying or you're showing anxiety, you know, teammates start looking around and say, get this guy out of here. He's the weak link. But this is why... Oh, go ahead.
  Speaker 1
  No, I hear you. And I just think that that's like, I think that's also part of what I feel like we talk about to combat. Because that is the Disney narrative. Right? I don't want to keep you's in Disney. I work for Disney. So I hope that I don't mean that. But you know, the Hollywood, the Hollywood version. Always be solid. So like the Hollywood version of this is that. But like, listen, like, nobody cried more than Frank Gore. I mean, we like cried like, and I hope he doesn't care that I'm putting this out there. Man, we will come in. It meant so much to him. And he is a first ballot Hall of Famer. I mean, this guy is like the stud of studs. Like I get asked all the time favorite, like again, not favorite, but like, he's the guy that like, I have the most pride that I got to share eight years with him, right? Like share a backfield with him. This guy's a stud of a human being and like Man, you come in after a loss like he I mean he wasn't like he Crying like in the locker room like it was real and like as a as a teammate is and appear Like to see him like let loose like that, sobbing and screaming. I mean, it's like, holy shit.
  Speaker 3
  I knew how much it meant to him. It was everything. But that's where, so Patrick, the reason I thought about what you said when you asked, who do you know? I told you I idolized my dad. I don't think my dad showed a lot of vulnerability growing up and I do think that the nature of that is that you think that's the right way to do it. And I've taken so much from my dad, 99%. One thing I will say that I've tried to do slightly differently is I try to show more vulnerability with the kids. My dad is the best dad in the world. He's not a guy who says he's sorry terribly frequently. I apologize to my kids a fair amount. Hey, man, I messed that up. I'm really sorry. This is my first time being a dad. You know, like that kind of stuff. And like, those are things I do think that I hope help us, you know. But the person that came to mind, one person, I think Pat Grady does a good job being strong and vulnerable. And I'll tell you some examples, like, you know, versus Sequoia for people who don't know. But I think one, he is willing to tell you, he's sort of is honest about how much it means to him. Which I think, and his voice shakes sometimes. He definitely cries more than most people, particularly in our kind of office. But his voice will shake with emotion sometimes. Not of anger, but he just really cares. Until that just comes through. Sometimes he'll tell you, I I'm worried, I'm kind of like losing my edge, I'm worried, I'm not in it enough, like, you know, and I think for me that helps because I find the current gentleman, It's like a hard job, right? And I think he's had a lot of success. And I actually think that there's a benefit that he doesn't even know that comes out from him saying like, recognizing that it's hard and saying like, look, like, I'm afraid that I'm Not doing this as well. I'm afraid that we're not doing this as well. And I think that it certainly helped me a lot that he demonstrates that vulnerability because someone who's newer to it is sort of like, it's okay to feel that way. I'm not supposed to feel like I always got it, you know, so I actually interestingly enough I think the best people do tend to do it. I do think is much more rare than It should be and part of what I hope we can do is like, you know Admit it a bit more and then what's the next step is not vulnerability in the past tense. Oh, man I used to go through this really tough time was really hard. It's vulnerability in the present tense. Like right now, it's fucking hard and here's why. And I think that's like a, you know, like another bar. But that I think is the most valuable vulnerability. It's not just like talking about how you came through it. It's like talking about when you're in it and like, what are you going to do about it? ([Time 1:05:41](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ee600e03-d69d-415f-9e35-91f69642495d))

  Summary:
  Recovery from a long-term injury demands resilience and courage to confront limitations and fears.
  The return to normalcy often feels distant until a breakthrough reveals new possibilities. A supportive partner plays a crucial role in navigating doubts, helping to focus on the present and the journey rather than solely on past struggles or future uncertainties.
  As one faces the anxiety of newfound opportunities, such as returning to a beloved sport, it's essential to weigh the significance of hard-earned progress against the fear of setbacks.
  Ultimately, the experience can redefine one's perspective on life and freedom, highlighting the importance of companionship and the strength found in vulnerability.

  So, my wife's gonna hate that I'm telling this. Because, you know, this is the nicest thing, maybe. When I was coming back for my leg injury, it was a long process, two year process, and throughout the entire time, you know, I'm getting regular scans and x-rays on my leg. And I had what was called, and I still have what's called a non-union, which means my leg's still broken. Okay. And I have a steel rod in there, but there's this spot that's not healing. And so even as I was kind of progressing through my rehab, it wasn't looking good that this prognosis, right? And so meanwhile I'm kind of pushing ahead, figuring out like if I want to push the limits of what I can do, you know, I've said I want to play football again, which was crazy, but I'm kind Of like, you I'm learning to walk. I'm learning to jog and jump and run and do these things all over again. And then COVID hits and the world shuts down. And so I go from getting regular scans to no scans at all. And, because like, right, like, it's just not happening. And so meanwhile, I've got to the point where I'm like lacing up cleats now. I'm and I've told you guys this like I'm recruiting every high school kid I can find to come run around my wife's playing defensive end and rushing, you know passer and I'm trying to see If I can like you know get out of harm's way and just I'm like loving this. This is like still a special time for me looking back in hindsight. Even though the world was obviously kind of chaotic. And uh, So I go this span of like almost eight nine months without imaging done and here we are we're getting towards the 2020 season and I I knew at this like it was kind of as we're getting Towards this time of year, right? Like right training camps going on. It was kind of like, make or break time. Like my wife had even said like, this is either happening or it's not. Right? Like it's this year or never. Now or never kind of thing. And so I go back to DC. And I get a big round of imaging done. Again, had it had been like eight months and I'm just kind of it had always been bad news. I'm expecting kind of more of the same because I got to get clearance to get played, to play, to have a chance to even try to attempt this comeback. And so I got all these MRIs, CT scans, x-rays all done. And my lead doctor in DC is like, hey, why don't you and Elizabeth come over, you know, like tomorrow night and we'll talk about everything and I'm like shit This is not good. Right? Like he's net we haven't done this like we've become incredibly close over two years But like this is not good. And so my wife and I go over there and I'm like definitely, you know Expecting bad news all the military docks that were consulting on my leg plus my team up surgeons in DC, it all kind of Conferred on the images. We meet him over in his backyard, he pours tequila for everybody, and I'm just like, fuck. And then he says it, and he's like, you're good to go. It's healed enough, right? And I'm like, no shit. I have this like the dumbest grin on my face. Because I'm asking him all these questions like, I thought like I'd never be able to do again. I'm like, I can go like mountain biking, rock climbing, skiing, snowboarding, right? Like bungee jumping, like, you know, like you name these like extreme things that I never thought I'd be able to do again. And he's like, yeah. And then it kind of hits me in that moment. Oh shit, he's gonna let me play football. And my stomach dropped, like in that moment. And I immediately get in my head again. And I'm worried, I'm anxious. Because I'm like, oh, because forever, it seems so unattainable. It was so far away that like while I was chasing it, right? Like it just I never was going to get there. And now it's it's here, like it's in front of me, like camp starts in a couple days. And I just got the green light. And it's like, oh, fuck, like, what if my leg breaks again? What if I make a fool out of myself? Like I got permanent drop foot. I got a bunch of crazy shit I gotta try and deal with. Like this could go wrong in so many ways, right? And I want off this so badly. Like I want like this train I'm on, get me off. And my wife's there and we leave and we just go sit in the car. And as we're like exiting, I am like just praying. She throws me a lifeline. They like, we get in this car and she says, you know what, babe? We just got this great news. Like the rest of our life, like, do we really need football? Like, and I want her so badly to like, give me this. Right. Like, because like, I'll take it right now. Like, you know, again, I'm scared to death. Just, again, self-doubt. And we get in the car and we just sit there. And just, I think she absolutely could sense, she knows me better than anybody, and could sense where I was at, and all my apprehension. And we just sat and talked. And about regret, kind of about life, about the two years of work that I had been putting in, right? And that like, if you'd have flashed back two years prior when I was sitting in that hospital bed and they were talking about like amputating my leg, if you'd asked that guy then, I would've Jumped at that. Are you fucking kidding? Hell yeah. I never thought that would happen, and now here I have it in front of me, and I'm gonna turn it down. I'm gonna turn my back on this, and I 1,000%, her. And she hates this because it's all like she was like pushing me back to play. Well, like, just talking to me, like so real. And again, like she carried such a burden for those two years like she nursed me back to health. I mean, I had a pick line in my heart like she had to like, we had ran I was in a wheelchair for six months. Like it just was, she carried such a burden like keeping the house together. And if there was someone that deserved to be like, let's not, you know, no more, like she did. And I think to just put everything in perspective and help me deal with all of that in that moment was such a real thing, and such a strong thing. And I don't think, like, I don't know if I could have done it if the roles had been reversed. And like my life, I think about my life would be so different if I hadn't done that. Yeah. Like, so different. Like the free like, knowing, I mean, I thought it was fragile. This leg had shattered, I was like immune compromised, like, you know, and the freedom I have going forward, the mindset because of that, like in that moment, and to think like that I ([Time 1:16:15](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3b0656e5-8a9c-4bd6-8561-16389fd24ec1))
