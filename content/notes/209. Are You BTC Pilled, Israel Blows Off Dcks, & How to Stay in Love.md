  Things like high performance, freedom responsibility, context not control, pay the above market wages. Anyway, Mr. Beast got a document called How to Succeed at his company and it got leaked. And there are some bangers in there like this this might usurp then the Netflix lippening give me give me the TLDR bangers here. Okay zoom in oh, yeah Okay, but this this like takes the the flavor out of it, but yes Yeah, cuz the way he writes so my favorite part of the whole document is that like?
  Speaker 1
  He doesn't edit it. He writes it like a zoomer.
  Speaker 2
  There's spelling errors, no capitalization, lol's in there. It's like he's talking to his team. He literally types lol inside of it. Can I can I read an excerpt? Read it. I got you on a picture in picture mode. OK. Well, I don't know if this is this is the excerpt I'm going to read, but we talked about founder mode before and He talks about Let's say You and a person agree that something needs to get Done in five days right in order to hit hit a deadline Okay, you don't get to you don't get to set a reminder for five days and not talk to him for five days every single day You must check in On Tyler and make sure he is on track to hit the target date. I want less excuses in this company. Take ownership and don't give your project a chance to fail. Dumping your bottleneck on someone and then just walking away until it's done is lazy and it gives room for error. And I want you to have a mindset that God himself couldn't stop you from making this video on time. Check in daily, leave no room for error. And I was like, oh, I need that a little more going on in our company. And I expresses in words this feeling you have. As a founder, you have this urgent feeling. Things need to go faster. There is too much unknowns. There's too much uncertainty. We need to move faster and with more certainty. And I read that I was like he sees me. I feel seen. Yeah there's a whole bunch of the ones I don't know if Armand you had some like special ones you wanted to...
  Speaker 1
  I loved that part. I didn't like the actual idea but I loved his communication. I love how like the candor in his document is just incredible. Like title of a section. I don't care how traditional media does things. Pardon the bluntness, but this is not Hollywood and I do not want to be Hollywood. And if that sense is a turn off to you, then you're probably at the wrong place. He continuously clarifies his position on things. It's very authoritarian as it should be for a company that is really trying to make it. He's trying to build a billion dollar enterprise, billion dollar media company, and he's well on his way. So the document's amazing.
  Speaker 4
  Okay, give me more.
  Speaker 2
  You want more? Okay. So he talks about how he wants employees to work with him Cuz he tells him like hey, this is what I got going on in my day-to so if you need help There's a certain way you should get help from
  Speaker 4
  How to approach me.
  Speaker 2
  Yeah, so he talks about you know Someone could come up to me and say hey, we're gonna give away a car in this video. What do you think about this? Lexus that we can get for 10 grand. He's like that is a terrible way to come up to. I don't know what's going on in the video you're creating. He's like, it would be better when getting an answer from me. It's ideal that you do research and come to me with context and options. Instead of saying, in an upcoming video, we're giving away a car. What do you think about this Lexus? Only 10 grand, which is how 99% of questions are asked towards me. Do this instead. We have a coming up video. One of the bits at 6 to 10 nine minute mark is we'll be giving away a car. We are still on budget, and the budget for the car is $10,000. I checked in with the budget. We could go up another $5K if you really wanted. I searched all the new North Carolina for cool-ass cars that price around that point. And here are five options I found pre-approved by Creative all on budget. I also got five other backup options that are less cool looking, and more average than that. Here's a picture of all 10. Here's the miles in the car, the information you want, which of these cars do you think is best, or should I get other options? If you wanna look like you're doing your job and don't care about the success of the video, ask me questions in like the first example. If you wanna take accountability and make your videos happen with a higher probability success, do the second. This doesn't apply to me, it applies to anyone high up you expect to make a decision.
  Speaker 1
  So there's a lot of stuff.
  Speaker 4
  No, I feel that that like resonates with me.
  Speaker 1
  Like really, the whole reason he put the document together is he's like, look, he starts by saying, like, you're probably not going to get to interact with me much.
  Speaker 4
  Yeah.
  Speaker 1
  Like we're at the point where you need to know how I think and you need to learn it and adopt it and then like I'm indoctrinating you.
  Speaker 4
  Yeah this is gonna help you and help me and this is gonna make everything go smoother if you come with like this.
  Speaker 1
  I love this piece on like the person's career. He's like if you want to have a career conversation, here's how to grow in this company. I mean, it's gold and we'll link to it. But he's basically saying, look, look, there's all this potential. We have two teams right now. We're going to have four next year, maybe eight soon. We need more leaders. And this is what a leader looks like. Obsessive, hardworking, coachable, intelligent grinders that can take, that can step up and take some of these leadership spots over the next two years. Every single department has opportunity for you to grow and you're luck because we don't do yearly reviews. We do whenever the fuck you want reviews. If you want to become a production manager, tell James your intention and ask him why you suck and how you can become better. Seriously, he will give you a list of things that you need to improve on to become what we need. And if you actually listen and master those things, we will give you a shot at the roll. Then he goes on to say, like, basically, most people never do this shit. If you really wanna do it, if you really wanna grow, you gotta take this thing by the horns and just go. And I love that, you know, again, the candor, the directness, the opportunity that he lays out in front of you, he's like, it's all here for the taking. We have a lot of money.
  Speaker 4
  I don't need it for myself. I'm not hoarding it. Come and get it. But you got to come and get it. So he's direct, but he's also asking you to be direct. Like he's asking the counterparty to also like, tell me what you want.
  Speaker 1
  And then let me judge you. You to be just like him. Yeah, he has clearly put in Tens of thousands like he's put in his hours. Yeah, and he's basically saying like this is the model to become Jimmy To become mr. Beast. This is how I think this is how I grew I'm obsessive and this is what you got to do to be like me He's also got another area where I like.
  Speaker 2
  One of his themes in here is don't take anything at face value. So one of the common themes you're probably seeing is accountability. And this doubles down on that. And I think this comes up a lot i... ([TimeÂ 1:19:26](https://share.snipd.com/snip/83bb7df3-5e9d-4c1c-98b1-c48d2b3a30a1))
