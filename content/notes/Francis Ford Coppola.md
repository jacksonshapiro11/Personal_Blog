### Highlights

- His dad was never successful he was bitter by people who weren’t as intelligent as him being more successful than him. Only after his son hired him to work on godfather did his dad achieve some happiness the story of the father is embedded in the son. His dad said he couldn’t be an artist because his dad was the only genius in the family and it wasn’t big enough for 2 geniuses.

    - **Note:** Story of the father embedded in the son. His dad tried and failed to create. Envy runs the world. His dad hated success until he tasted it for himself then he was happy.
      Sometimes in life you do the right things and fail other times you never had a chance at success.
- Francis is incredibly talented and pretentious sometimes he doesn’t know what he’s doing others it’s pure genius. He said he would be very successful or burn out. He worked harder than anyone at the whole school. There is no speed limit and the standard pace is for chumps. He goes to film school in the 60s and at this time is the prime of movie making. Francis scorsese Spielberg and Lucas are all coming to prominence and all friends and product of these film schools. The cross pollination of ideas was massive at this time. Copolla set the tone as previously directors needed decades of experience he directed in his 20s. He had hutzpah and was incredibly resourceful he had the ucla film staff wrapped around his fingers in weeks. For a student film he needed the statue of David he found one at a cemetery that banned movies but said he was a college kid and it was an Indy movie he then contacted the biggest camera manufacturer and gave the same spiel he showed up to the shoot with 60 people he had incredible charisma

    - **Note:** Francis embodied the quotes about the kid who asks motzart to write a symphony. He is just this ball of creative energy with incredible charisma who didn’t believe limits existed so he always dreamed big and crazy. It bankrupt him a couple times but he made amazing art. Also hot spot of culture at the time critical mass of smart people
- Coppola seized opportunities and did things other students felt were below them. He works for a b movie director but works his ass off the director reciprocates and they build a great partnership. Reciprocity principle. Say yes first and learn later. Forced to discover how to do it. All resourcefulness and hustle. Francis seized the moment. He took big chances with personal investments instead of asking to make a movie he wrote the script and showed it to the director. His way in the movie industry was through writing and his screenplays won awards. Closed mouths don’t get fed you need to be out there. He’s a gambler and lost his entire wealth many times don’t ask just go ahead and force the issue. He told people the movie was lined up both the actors and studios. He bluffed many times and this leads to opportunities. He was a hustler of the highest regard. He eventually uses this to break into the industry accepting a low offer to show his skills. The best person you’ll ever hire is the person who’s it last job. He always invested in technology to constantly improve. He hired George Lucas for his right hand man who then became very successful.

    - **Note:** Francis took and created opportunities for himself. He wrote screenplays instead of asking then presented the finished work and asked for a movie. He took chances and did grunt work others wouldn’t to position himself better. He bet on himself and went for broke often.
      Closed mouths don’t get fed you need to put yourself and work out there which he did with bluffs and low ball offers to show his skills. Easier to ask for forgiveness than permission
- Coppola wanted a lot of freedom but he lost his money many times over and wasn’t a financial mind as a result his best movies were made early when he had the independence and go for broke attitude and later when he was more financially focused his work quality was much lower as he admitted. In any business you need to control the money. He gets fired from his own company as a result of this and his screenwriter background he gets offered The Godfather which establishes his career. The lowest point of getting booted from his own company turn into making the best movie ever. Every movie was a start up. He was super in depth with godfather taking his time running out of budget almost getting fired or quitting 5 times because he wanted to get it right the process was near impossible but the product was the best movie ever. The benefit of struggle and discomfort. Francis had charisma past logic.

    - **Note:** Francis learned risk and return his best movies were made when he took the most risk when he stopped taking risk his movies sucked but he was more financially successful. Taking the safe route.
      Getting fired from his job turned into the godfather from his lowest point he created his best moment. He was a perfectionist through and through get it right or not at all.
- Apocalypse now almost killed him destroyed his marriage and bankrupt him. This burnt him out and was the peak of his career. He was never the same after. Consistency over intensity or you burn out. Martin sheen said Coppola was incredibly hard to work for her had a heart attack during filming but Coppola lived in the mud and never asked people to do things he wouldn’t as a result sheen would run through a wall for him.
  He helped launch Lucas’s film career and when the film executive said the film wasn’t good enough he launched into a tirade defending Lucas. Offering to finance the movie himself the power of having a good friend in your corner.
  He went broke 3 times in 9 years after making 3 of the best movies ever. He makes the biggest flop in movie history that ruins him completely. with no other plan he got back out there and kept on going he never gives up.

    - **Note:** Francis was after tail outcomes and was great at his craft but eventually went you bet everything constantly you get unlucky and his biggest success was his lowest point. You need to take the risks that help you sleep at night.
      Francis was a great man and would stick by his men and be in the shit with them which led to them respecting him. He launched Lucas’s film career as well importance of support and good mentors.
      He gave and lost everything
