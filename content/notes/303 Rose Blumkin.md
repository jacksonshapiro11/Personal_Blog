  Tomorrow I go to work, she said. The owner relented and Rose got up before dawn the next morning and cleaned the store. She stayed, becoming the manager of that store by the age of 16. Then she went to a larger town, got another job in a men's clothing store as a salesman, and met Isadore Blumkin. They were married in 1914 and Mrs. B later remembered her wedding day, saying, my mother brought me two pounds of rice and two pounds of cookies. That was the wedding feast. World War I erupted that same year and many inhabitants of Russia had to flee. Isadore was able to emigrate to the United States. We didn't have the money for two passages, Rose said, and so my husband had to go alone. For the next three years Rose worked in a dry goods store, squeezed every penny, and finally in 1917 took a train to the Chinese Siberian border. I had no passport at the China-Russia frontier a soldier was standing guard with a rifle. I said to him, I'm all the way to buy leather for the army. When I come back I'll bring you a big bottle of vodka. I suppose he's still there waiting for his vodka, she said, laughing. She made away from China to Japan and then booked passage on a Japanese peanut boat. After six miserable weeks the ship finally docked in Seattle. When she got to America she had $66 in her purse. The Red Cross helped Rose find her husband who was living in Iowa. ([Time 0:04:13](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ad225d41-bc08-41d8-9151-3fed47d8438d))
    - **Note:** Her journey to the states is crazy leaving home at 13 with 4 cents. Her husband couldn’t afford passage for her during WW1 so she spent 3 years working to travel across Russia through war boarders to get a peanut boat to the us which lasted 6 weeks then found her husband in Iowa through the Red Cross.
- The Incredible Story of Rose Blumkin and Warren Buffett's Biggest Acquisition
  Summary:
  Rose Blumkin, at almost 90 years old, continued to work tirelessly for over a decade after selling her business.
  Warren Buffett's acquisition of her company, described in a negotiation where he bought it for 60 million while Mrs. B demanded more, turned out to be his biggest acquisition ever. Despite not being able to write or read English, Mrs. B sealed the deal with a simple mark.
  When Buffett presented her with a check for 90%, she casually folded it without looking at it, stating their competitors will go through a meat grinder, showcasing Mrs. B's fierce spirit at the age of 89.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Rose was just shy of 90 years old at the time. You would assume that this change in ownership would signal retirement for Rose, but she still worked for more than a decade longer 12 to 14 hours a day, seven days a week until she reached The age of 103. So after I read the book and went and searched all the highlights that I have about Rose Blumkin, and back on episode one, two, I read a biography of Warren Buffett that came out in 1995. It's called Buffett the Making of American Capitalist. And there's this great excerpt in that book that describes this purchase that this book is describing. And it's the negotiation. If you can call that between Buffett and Mrs. B. And this is, I think, the second or third time he had tried to buy. I think I know he tried to buy at least one other time, maybe like 20 years earlier. And so it says, how much Buffett asked 60 million Mrs. B spat out? They shook hands and Buffett drew up a one page agreement, Buffett's biggest acquisition by far. Mrs. B, who could not write in English and barely could read it, made a mark at the bottom. A few days later, Buffett presented her with a check for 90%. This is my favorite part. She folded it without a glance. And by way of concluding matters declared, Mr. Buffett, we're going to put our competitors through a meat grinder. She was 89 when she said that. ([Time 0:06:38](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4e0a8625-8d43-4ff7-b486-506b4b79b875))
    - **Note:** Rose could barely speak or write English even at 90 when Buffett bought the company she said she’d put the competition through a meat grinder. She worked 12-14 hours a day for about her decade after the acquisition
- Lessons from Hanging Advertisements: Remembering the Importance of Avoiding Business Failure
  Summary:
  Hanging framed going out of business advertisements from competitor stores in the office of Nebraska Furniture Mart serves as a constant reminder of the risk of business failure and the importance of avoiding it.
  This practice highlights the need to remember the consequences of failing in the business world. Additionally, the story of Mrs. B, the founder, who had a humble beginning, not being able to attend school and starting to work at a very young age, emphasizes the seriousness and dedication required to build a successful business.
  The success of Nebraska Furniture Mart, generating profits exceeding all other furniture stores in Omaha combined, showcases the value that can be created from such dedication and hard work.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  This is one of my favorite parts of this entire like mini biography of Rose. Look what they hang on the walls in the office of Nebraska furniture market. There are several going out of business advertisements from competitor stores framed and hanging on the wall displayed so that the company will never forget about those other stores Who put themselves out of business, how it can happen to anyone and that it must be avoided. And so yeah, that's a good idea as a reminder. Hey, how bad things can get. You know, Buffett has like a newspaper code soon from the depression to remind him for the same thing. But after getting to know Mrs. B, I just can't help but thinking that she also put it up there to like look what happens when you try to go against me. I on a unapologetically adore and love her approach and how serious she took her work. And just if you think about the opening where you just think about how difficult her early life was, she was never able to go to school. Ever not elementary school, not college, not high school, nothing. You know, having to start working at six years old, live on a straw mat and then have the opportunity to come to America and build a business that made her and her unborn grandchildren Rich. I could see why she would take it so seriously. So let's go back to the very humble beginnings of this business that's unbelievably valuable. I think in later shareholder letters, they were doing more. They were doing what 120 million a year just out of the one Nebraska store. I think it was more than all the other furniture stores in Omaha combined. ([Time 0:08:57](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f7de042b-82b9-4540-9154-ccaf7657ad31))
    - **Note:** Rose was ruthless she hung going out of business signs from competition up slept on a straw mat and was working at 6. She was ruthless and tough to work for but this made her dominant. She had been working at stores since she was 6. She knew great business. She would offer to sell furniture at her house if people liked it. Always working. She had a massive chip on her shoulder.
- Building Customer Trust Through Honesty
  Key takeaways:
  - Building trust and relationships with customers leads to long-term loyalty and recommendations to others.
  - Being honest and transparent with customers can lead to respect and a positive reputation.
  - Resolving problems with customers, even if they are difficult, is important.
  - The story of Mrs. B opening a successful furniture store with a small loan demonstrates the potential for success through hard work.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And therefore, it builds trust and a relationship with these customers and they're going to come back forever. They're going to tell their friends their kids are going to go there, their grandkids are going to go there. Assuming you're in a, like, if you're in a game that you're going to play for a long time, this is like the version of this idea of infinite return on investment. I never lied, I showed them the bill and then, and they all respect me. You should see what kind of customers I have, the best in the world. They build me one of the finest businesses in the country. I always believe in honesty. Anything is wrong. I try to make it right. Meaning obviously, if the problem has, if the customer is a problem, I'll make it right. Mrs. B opened a furniture store in 1937 with a $500 loan from one of her brothers. It was a 30 by 100 foot basement room. She called it the Nebraska furniture mark. This is hilarious. The day, the same day I opened, another furniture store was opening. They had an orchestra, orchestra music and Hollywood stars and I only had a three, and I only had three line one ads because I was poor. I did that day a big business. I couldn't get over it. Rose was 43 years old at the time and her four children were between the ages of 10 and 19. And then this story is also mentioned in Buffett's shareholder letters, which was fantastic. The fact that she gets sued by her competitors over charging customers too little. Mrs. B would encounter a fair number of obstacles in growing her business throughout the years. She would choose to make a small profit of 10%. Bend over backwards for customers and grow the company by selling in large volumes. It also made her competitors very angry. At one point, Mrs. B was able to convince Marshall's Fields to sell her carpet wholesale at $3 per yard. She then resold it for $3.95 per yard. The competition was selling the very same carpet for $7.95 per yard. Her competition called her a bootlegger. Her reply was, You betcha. I'm the best bootlegger in town. So then she tells the story of what happened. These three lawyers take from this one company, take me into court suing me for unfair trade practices. Three lawyers and me with my English. I can't afford a lawyer, so I just go to the judge and I say, Judge, I sell everything 10% above cost. What's wrong? Can I give my customers a good deal? I don't rob my customers. The judge agreed throughout the case and above $1,400 worth of carpeting from Mrs. B the next day. ([Time 0:14:45](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e7765fe6-5520-478f-8974-f5265b969d77))
    - **Note:** She was open and honest that she only sold 10% above cost which created good will and kept customers coming back. She got sued because she was selling things at such a discount her competition just sued her. No one had the business model before her. In the case she told the judge the truth he threw out the case and bought from her the next day
- The Resourceful and Relentless Mrs
  Key takeaways:
  - Rose persevered through personal tragedy and didn't see her gender as a hindrance to success
  - The fire sale after the 1961 fire at Nebraska furniture mart was hugely successful
  - Rose saw problems as opportunities and was always looking for ways to innovate and make money
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Unfortunately, this is the same time that her husband dies. Is door had a heart attack and died. They were married for 36 years and Rose would be a widow for 48 years. Mrs. B once asked if she believed that she had a tougher time succeeding because she was a woman. She said, me, no, sir, she answered. When it comes to business, I could beat any man in any college graduate. She was relentless. Another example of that. In 1961, half of Nebraska furniture mart was destroyed by a fire. The resulting fire sale generated a line two blocks long to buy hugely discounted items that had been exposed to the smoke. One of my favorite maxims from the history of entrepreneurship is problems or opportunities and work clothes. She's like, OK, campaign my bills gets us loan. Does a three day limited sale makes five times the amount of money, right? Then fire comes. OK, well, what can I do? Now I have a bunch of inventory I need to get rid of hugely discounted just because it has a little bit of smoke damage. People love saving money. A couple years later, actually about 15 years later, 1975, a tornado took out the entire Nebraska furniture mart building. The tornado also destroys a post office next to the mark. So what does she do? She buys the ground and built on it to expand the business. We have turned every tragedy into a positive. That's another way of saying problems are just opportunities and work clothes. Then it goes into a description of her insane work hours and her dedication. The fact that work was a hobby for her with her children grown and out of the house. She devoted her entire existence to growing Nebraska furniture mart. She loved the game of selling. She didn't care a bit about the money. It was all about making the sales, she said. ([Time 0:18:44](https://share.snipd.com/snip/88846dff-1b08-46bf-bebe-c35b8cef584b))
    - **Note:** Problems are opportunities in work clothes every time they’re was an issue that could’ve put her out of business she flipped it to an advantage. She didn’t love money she loved the game of selling.
- Meet Mrs. B, the 97-year-old who still works and influenced Walmart's business model
  Summary:
  Mrs. B, a 97-year-old woman, left a luncheon to go back to work, questioning why others weren't working too.
  She couldn't attend a shareholder meeting because of work commitments, showing her dedication. Before mainstream retailers, Mrs. B pioneered successful merchandising practices of discount stores making small profits on large volumes, influencing Walmart's business model.
  She believed in running the company fiscally conservative due to the fear of another depression.
  Despite having no formal education, she had exceptional arithmetic skills, impressing people with her quick calculations on national TV.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Yet she was back in the store two hours later. She is 97. This is insane. There was a luncheon where Mrs. B was being honored. The luncheon was dragging on. And at about 115, Mrs. B stood up and hollered. What is wrong with you people? Don't you have jobs? I'm going back to work. And she left. Here's another addition to the rose file. Warren Buffett said during the opening remarks at the 1993 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting, I'd like to introduce Berkshire's managers, except Mrs. B, who couldn't take time off of work for such foolishness like a shareholder meeting. And this is what I was mentioning earlier. Mrs. B developed successful merchandising practices long before they were adopted by mainstream retailers. She had established the idea of a discount store making small profits on large volumes. Sam Walton didn't open his first discount store leading to the Walmart Empire until 1962. The company still follows these principles. It is run very fiscally conservative, conservatively. Mrs. B always felt that the days of the depression could return at any time. We still run the company like the depression is coming back. We have no debt. So she never spent a single day in a classroom. She had a savance capacity for arithmetic. So this is the idea of she gets interviewed on ABC's like nationally televised show 2020 and people can't imagine, can't believe how fast she is with numbers. ([Time 0:24:06](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d723047d-4f89-459d-be13-97aa0b9366f4))
    - **Note:** People get recognized for what they do in private. She invented the ideas of discount stores despite being at going to school she created. She was an amazing salesperson but abusive to her employees.
- Warren Buffett's $60 Million Offer for Nebraska Furniture
  Summary:
  Warren Buffett, impressed by Mrs. B's business savvy, offered $7 million in the late 1960s for Nebraska Furniture, which was turned down.
  Two decades later, Buffett came back with a $60 million offer for 90% of the company, sealing the deal with a handshake. Buffett admired Mrs. B's intelligence, competitiveness, and work ethic, stating that if she ran a popcorn stand, he would want to do business with her.
  He praised the company's smart buying practices, efficient operations, and customer-focused cost savings.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Okay, so bring in somebody that's way more calm that's better at dealing with employees. And like they said, she may fire an employee, but then her son who's more calm might hire that person back after the fact. And then here's the story I referenced earlier, Warren had previously tried to buy this business. Warren Buffett had known of the business and was aware of its success from living in Omaha. He admired the Blumkins business savvy. In the late 1960s, he had offered $7 million for Nebraska furniture. Mark, an amount. This is hilarious, an amount that Mrs. B turned down while calling him cheap. Two decades later, Warren came into the market again for the purpose of making Mrs. B another offer this time at $60 million for 90% of the company. Mrs. B and Buffett shook hands on the deal. No lawyers were involved and there was no audit and no inventory was taken of the merchandise. Buffett said, if she ran a popcorn stand, I'd want to be in business with her. She's just plain smart. She's a fierce competitor and she's a tireless worker. And this is one of my favorite things that he said. And I think it's a good idea for us to think of, are we the answer to Buffett's question? That'll make more sense in one second. One question I always ask myself in a praising of business is how I would like assuming I had ample capital and skilled personnel to compete with it. I would rather wrestle grislies than compete with Mrs. B. They buy brilliantly. They operate at expense ratios, competitors don't even dream about. And then they pass on to their customers much of the savings. ([Time 0:26:40](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a54f74fb-4b05-46ad-8698-1f1cd28c1e51))
    - **Note:** Buffet would rather wrestle grizzlies than compete with Mrs B. Exception value to the customer creates exceptional economics for the ownership.
- The Business Principles of Mrs. B
  Summary:
  Mrs. B ran her business with unwavering decisiveness, moving quickly without second-guessing decisions.
  She believed in simplicity, focusing on selling cheap and telling the truth. Despite family disputes, she prioritized reconciliation and control, exemplifying her business philosophy throughout her life.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Mark go out of business. She says it should go out. It should go up and smoke. I like that they should go. They should go to hell, she replied. The reason she able to move so fast is because there's really no it's everything's black and white. There's really no like shades of gray with her. And so at this point, she felt, you know, they took away her cargo department or tried to overwrite her decision. So that's it. You're going to go to hell and buff it picks up on that. So everything with Mrs. B. Knew how to do. She would do fast. She did not hesitate and there was no second guessing. She'd buy 5,000 tables or sign a 30 year lease or buy real estate or hire people. There was no looking back. She just swung. The rules of running her business were very simple. Sell cheap. Tell the truth. Fortunately, Mrs. B. Lived long enough to reconcile with her family. The first relationship to be patched up with was Warren Buffett. Rose was angry with him because she felt that he had sided with her grandsons. Two days before her 98th birthday, Buffett once again bought her roses and chocolates and brought it to her job. He's a real gentleman, she said, after accepting Buffett's peace offering. She settled her differences with her grandsons and sold Mrs. B's warehouse. The new company. Two Nebraska furniture mart for $5 million with a provision that she could keep control of the carpet department. This time, Buffett made sure to have Mrs. B at age 99 sign a non-compete agreement. And then Mrs. B looks back at this time and really she's just saying, you know, control is obviously priority number one. ([Time 0:31:10](https://share.snipd.com/snip/091284f8-a38a-4ec1-8428-e7071048cd00))
    - **Note:** She valued control when she felt she was losing control she started a new business at 96 with the idea of crushing her family in the old business. Buffet patched things up and bought her business after 3 years for $5mm. She was ruthless and at 99 buffet made her sign a non compete.
