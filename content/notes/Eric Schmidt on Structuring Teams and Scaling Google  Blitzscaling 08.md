- Judgment in Scaling and Product Development
  Summary:
  Scaling a company involves a balance between rapid growth and ensuring products work effectively before launch.
  The key is not just expanding quickly but focusing on small teams with dedicated leaders who weigh trade-offs and meticulously perfect products. Examples like the original iPod and iPhone show that initial products might barely work but can turn into successful franchises.
  Deciding when a product is ready to scale is crucial.
  Google's approach under Larry and Sergey of innovating and surprising even their CEO with projects like Chrome and Android highlights the importance of judgment in scaling.
  The cautionary tale of Google Wave emphasizes the significance of monitoring product success in the initial months to avoid investing in unsuccessful ventures. Therefore, scaling quickly is viable with well-developed products that have the potential to grow rapidly and globally.

  Matter of fact it was one year. I think it was 2004 to 2005 you over tripled the number of employees in that year.
  Speaker 1
  I do have a saying about this. It's easy to double. It's very hard to quadruple every year. And it's a bit of advice. You can double. You can kind of see it. You can kind of. Okay, I can add another person here and I can add another person and then I can expand in this country and so on and so on. But to quadruple is almost impossible. So what were the kind of because you had to invent a lot of these techniques, right? These hacks.
  Speaker 2
  I mean everything from the three of you reading every resume to you know keeping innovation going with 20% time other kinds of things. What were the what were the key hacks that worked and the key hacks that didn't work?
  Speaker 1
  So I want to offer a cautionary tale and again having both read your book and also the notes that you kindly sent me before this. If you don't understand the subtlety here you would conclude that the correct thing to do is to grow everything as fast as you possibly can everywhere, right? So let's just make as many engineers as many salespeople as many products and so on. That completely does not work. And it doesn't work because no product shall ship before it actually works, right? The way you build great products is you have small teams with strong leaders who obsess over trade-offs and they push things off and they say we've got to get it done and they put a lot of Pressure on the team and they work all night and they produce a product that just barely works. Okay the original use non-Google examples the original iPod just barely worked. Look at what it became. Try people remember the original iPhone, no apps, right? Everyone's forgotten that. That barely worked but it just was just the right combination to create an enormous franchise that's now 70% of the revenue of the world's most valuable company. We're talking to Travis Klinic, we are major investors inside of Uber so we have good relationships with Uber and his description of Uber was that he understood scaling but the product, The app wasn't ready. You have to sort of have judgment about when the product is ready to scale against it. And so we would debate this over and over again and so Larry and Sergey would play tricks on me. So a typical example would be I would say we're not strong enough to take on Microsoft and they wanted to do an operating system in a browser. And I said there's no scenario where we'll ever do an operating system in a browser. Because Microsoft will kill us and I don't want to kill a small company and yes yes you're very smart and yes yes we're full of smart people and yes yes we have lots of revenue. These guys can kill us because I've been previously killed in the previous jobs. And so they hired somebody to improve the performance of Firefox. Six months later I'm called down to one office and this person who is supposed to improve the performance of Firefox has managed to invent Chrome.
  Speaker 2
  Shocking.
  Speaker 1
  And I said well how long have you been doing this? Well I've been doing it on the side. No you haven't you've done it full time. Well yeah you know I had three other people. Okay well how many more people do you have? Oh ten more people. Well did Larry, okay did Larry and Sergey know about this? Larry and Sergey encouraged us. I said those axles right. I knew it. I knew they were going around me.
  Speaker 2
  Okay. That's.
  Speaker 1
  So and then I said well we can't do an operating system. So they bought this company called Android and they said yeah yeah it's just for smartphones. It's software for smartphones don't worry Eric. Today Android is 1.4 billion plus operating systems use largest number of operating systems in the world. Chrome is the largest and most successful browser. So maybe the lesson to learn and management is I'm just wrong all the time. But the secret was you sort of you have to have judgment as to when these things can scale right. And I can give you plenty of negative examples. An obvious one is Wave right. It was a complicated email product that we launched to great fanfare and we watched its adoption rate. Marissa had this rule which is a good rule that you cannot at Google you cannot tell how successful a product is until the first six months because what happens is you get this adoption Cycle and everyone loves the product because everyone tests it and then you watch what happens and the great products you know they're bumpy but they go up. Well this is what it looked like like this. So it took Eric your friendly CEO 18 months of going down straight down before that project was canceled. So again lack of due diligence last so the reason I'm answering your question and the Blitz growth argument by saying you've got to have the products that you can scale. If you have the products that can scale the thing that's new is you can scale very quickly. The Uber example once you have an app and a business model that more or less works there's no reason why you shouldn't go global and wide. When I started at Google I sat at my first concern with Google was I thought the whole thing was a sham. ([Time 0:13:10](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4a6dffff-b4ab-4e5b-9bf7-9ff4047d0564))
