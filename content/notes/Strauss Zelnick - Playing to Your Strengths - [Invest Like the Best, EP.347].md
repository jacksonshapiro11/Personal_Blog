- Being Passionate about Creative Arts and Creative Business
  Key takeaways:
  - Attachment to consistency
  - Interest in creative arts and business
  - Passion for entertainment and technology
  - Creating inflection points in career
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I don't know. I might have an attachment to consistency that's greater than many people. I was always interested in everything creative and I wanted like many people who work in media and communications and entertainment. I wanted to be a creator and entertainer first and foremost. I don't really want to be an actor, although I actually did dabble in that when I was a kid. Then I wanted to be a singer-songwriter, then I wanted to be a writer, and then I realized I probably shouldn't be any of those things, but I was still really interested in the creative Arts and creative business. And that led me into entertainment initially and it spoke to me. I do enjoy business just as business. I think I'm better like many people when I'm passionate about the thing that I'm working on, and I'm really passionate about entertainment. And then more recently, but still quite a long time ago, technology. Then that was more sort of a weird twist on my career, which is a story I can tell you. But initially, I like any people I wanted to be an entertainer and a creator and then realized that I didn't have any talent to speak of.
  Speaker 2
  In the spirit of that twist, I'm curious how you would define the eras of the media business across your career that are most important. I'm guessing that the internet and everything that it brought on media is a key thing, but what are the key inflection points as you think back across the whole history?
  Speaker 1
  I intentionally created most of those inflection points for myself. I initially wanted to run a movie studio, but people weren't exactly lining up to hire me to run a movie studio, so I got the only and best job I could get in entertainment when I graduated From school, which was to work in sales at Columbia Pictures Television. ([Time 0:03:20](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f1ca0200-5b8e-40d0-bd87-85da1dc75509))
    - **Note:** Created his own inflection points. Wanted to run a movie studio but worked at Columbia out of school instead of going to walk street. Learned how to sell and became an executive young. Then worked as an executive to 20th century fox at a young age. Just picked up production and distribution. Was in paid tv in the 1980s and home entertainment which were really small but good for a young person. Realized they were the future so invested heavily in himself in these areas and ended up at a pre revenue early video game company and he was so engrained in it from his work he knew what to do more than anyone at fox.

  - Identifying genuine talent and engaging people in a common mission are crucial skills.

  - Being willing to acknowledge when you didn't contribute to a hit is a rare trait.
  - Creating an environment that supports and enables success is essential.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  That's not really what I do because I became a chief executive really early in my career, serendipitously and oddly and without regard for the fact that I had no experience and didn't Deserve the job. I just got lucky. I sort of skipped over a lot of that and went right to running businesses. Running a business is different, obviously. There are numerous jobs and entertainment that are important for the mission of the entertainment company that have nothing to do with creating the entertainment itself. The most important jobs, of course, are the ones that create the entertainment. Those are the only people who really matter in the entertainment business so they're people who create the hits.
  Speaker 2
  You remind me of my favorite part of my conversation in this format with Peter, which was talking about working with James Cameron on a couple of those huge films. And then one of the questions was, what is the best way to work with talents like that? And maybe Rockstar is a great example of obviously the biggest game out there, people building this brilliant thing as creatives and the lessons you've learned about working with Those people to protect them in such a way that they can do their thing and also manage the business on the other hand. It seems like those two skills sit next to each other. Peter had all sorts of interesting thoughts about that and I would love to hear your take on working with all sorts of creatives and how to do that well.
  Speaker 1
  So first one size does not fit all. My approach and style is different than Peter, for example, and different than many other people who've had great success. So people like Jeffrey Katzenberg, for example, I think the way he's succeeded in doing that is that he's intimately engaged with the creative process. He's intimately engaged with the creative ideas. He's intimately engaged with story and I am not because I don't have those skills. And so the way I engage with talent is different because it's a reflection of who I really am and what value I can legitimately bring to bear and the talent that I choose to work with. Jim Cameron's a great example for me because he was not interested in my creative point of view. Let me just be clear. And I knew enough about myself to know that I couldn't add any value. It's not like Jim Cameron needed my help. Thank you very much. So what he really needed was support and empathy and kindness and enthusiasm and encouragement. And he occasionally needed to help navigating the waters when there were budgetary concerns or timing concerns. I think by the thing that I invest in, I'm not sure it's a skill, but it served me well, is that I seem to have an ability to identify genuine talent and other people, whether that's creative Talent or executive talent. I seem to be able to tell the difference between the real deal and not the real deal. And I also seem to have some ability to engage people in a common mission, to encourage the highest degree of quality and performance, and to create enthusiasm for a shared vision. And then I'm good at getting that out of the way. I don't have any fantasy about my own talents and I'm okay with that. And there are a couple areas where I think I have some expertise and I'm fine sharing those. But I found that identifying the top talent and persuading them to work within your organization and then encouraging them to seek perfection and pursue their passions is actually An unusual set of skills in the entertainment business and a willingness to put one zone that you go to the side. Not too many people are willing to say, as I will, I didn't have anything to do with that hit. And I say that because it's true. I'm really lucky. I've run every kind of entertainment organization that there is. And during my tenure, 100% of the time, our team has had the highest hit ratio in the business. And this is reasonably well known. And the reason I'm comfortable saying those words first is because they're true, but secondly is because I didn't have anything to do with their creation. Nothing whatsoever. I did have something to do with creating an environment that made that possible. And I mentioned the selection of talent and the engagement with talent. And I think the other piece is, and I don't think this is like any terrific or rare skill, but I'm going to run a rational organization that's appropriate, highly compliant, efficient, Organized, sound at making decisions and come. And well-financed. So I'm able to say to a creator, look, this is a safe place to work. My crazy voice. No one's going to let their ego interfere with what you do. Myself included. No one's going to take credit for what you do, myself included. We're not going to do anything crazy on your watch. We're not going to go make- rage. You're not going to be fighting off silly announcements and I'm not going to be on page 6. None of that's going to happen here. And by the way, we'll be kind to you. Whether they're business or personal, I actually am here to help and I genuinely care about you as a person. Genuinely care. And you'll be the star. It sounds like. And keep part of the package. Yeah. Creators will be the star. I'm not even in the backseat. I'm in the caboose. And that also is consistent with my personality. I don't want to get credit for something I didn't do. That's not who I am. I guess I wouldn't mind credit for something I did do. But I really don't want credit for something I didn't do. ([Time 0:10:30](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0b48b54f-7072-4f16-a8d1-feed000d4eae))
    - **Note:** Part of helping creators is understand what you need to provide them and what you can provide them. James Cameron doesn’t need creative direction but that doesn’t mean he doesn’t neee help. Needs enthusiasm and encouragement. Identify talent well and create shared mission and vision. Willing to take the backseat to the true creative is vital. Put your ego to the side and say I did nothing to make that successful led to highest hit radio pass credit. Gives creator a good kind stable environment to create. Genuinely caring about others.
- A Request for Three Months: How Greg Stayed and Built a Successful Sports Business
  Key takeaways:
  - The speaker successfully convinced an employee to stay by asking for three months to improve the company's organization and culture.
  - The speaker learned the hard way that titles and credentials don't guarantee credibility, and building relationships is important in business.
  - Despite having the right ideas, the speaker's tone and approach at a new company caused the organization to resist change, leading to nearly failing.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And even though our sports business was tiny in those days, and I remember sitting in my temporary office out there and Greg, who is an adult and self-confident and real smart. Came into the office and he said, I've heard you're a decent guy and I imagine you have some interesting plans for trying to make this a better company, but I've had it. I want you to know I'm leaving. And there's nothing you can say. Please don't even try. It would embarrass both of us. I've just got to move on. I cannot do it here anymore. And I said, I hear you. I understand. I know exactly what you're saying. I'm going to ask you to do something for me. And he said, what's that? I said, I'd like you to give me three months. Just give me three months. And if at the end of three months you feel like it's a lost cause, you can go with my blessing. But in three months I'd like to be able to show you that this is a kind of organization that you could be happy working in. And he thought about it. He really didn't want to say yes. And Greg could work anywhere and could have at the time. And he said, because he's a good guy, he said, okay, I'll give you three months. And Greg is still running visual concepts today, 17 years later. NBA 2K is the number one basketball title. And he has numerous other titles like WWE 2K, PGA Tour 2K, and many other titles that have been hugely successful and continue to be successful in sports. There was something about the nature of that engagement at that time that caused Greg to stop and give me another chance. I do think had I come in and said, I straddled some really great at this stuff. And I know everything. I have some wonderful ideas for your basketball game. And here's a magazine that I was on the cover of. And here's where I went to school. And had I handled it that way, which is some people's style, but not mine, key or left. Or had I said, incidentally, I want to let you know that I think your strategy or your execution or whatever is lousy. And I'm going to give you some ideas to fix it. I have learned, and I learned the hard way, to break no glass initially, and to listen first, and err on the side of treating people with great respect.
  Speaker 2
  What was the hard way that you learned?
  Speaker 1
  So I had this pretty quick progression. I was at Columbia Pictures for two years, and I got promoted to become the youngest VP at Columbia Pictures. I got recruited to Vastron, and within nine months became the President of Vastron, which was already the largest independent. And then it was only three years after that when I was recruited to become President Chief Operating Officer of 20th Century Fox, and I was 32 years old. And I thought I had pretty well figured this business out. But I completely missed that being President of a large independent in those days was utterly meaningless to the major motion picture business. It was lost on me that I had no real relationships in Hollywood, because I had worked on the East Coast, because that's where Vastron was headquartered. I didn't realize, because I wasn't self-ware enough at the time, I came in with no credibility. And I thought that the business card, the title in the office, was the credibility I needed to succeed. And Fox was a turnaround. It was in the last place at the box office. It had a bloated operation, and its international operations were no good. And Rupert Merock and Barry Diller were dead set on turning it around, which is why they brought me in. They did not bring me in as a caretaker. I had a big brief of stuff I needed to get done. I just went in assuming I know what to do, which I did, and other people will rely on me to do it, which was not true. Barry and Rupert were relying on me to do what no one else was. And I didn't think that not having relationships or not being known or getting to know people was even relevant. I just thought, hey guys, this is business. We're here to do business. So I showed up, despite the fact that this is Century City in August, wearing my Brooks Brothers suit, I'm not kidding in polished shoes. This is long ago. So I was wearing suspenders and a necktie. And to say that I didn't read the room implies that I bothered to look around the room. I thought, no, that's irrelevant. I went in all guns blazing. I was going to change everything all at once. And you know, the thing is, I was right about a lot of it. I was right about almost all of it. But it was irrelevant. Because my tone and approach was completely wrong. Years later, I had a business coach named Gloria Henn, who's retired now. She's a phenomenal business coach. And she said to me, you're really good with the words. You're not always so good with the music. So I showed up with the song sheet, but I forgot about the music. I just had the words. And I was really ineffectual because the entire organization just seized up against me, even though I was the president. And I nearly failed. I nearly got to a point where I was so incapable of getting anything done that the fact that I was right and I had all the right ideas. Didn't matter. ([Time 0:17:06](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4354032e-eb91-4580-996a-840ef3506bc4))
    - **Note:** He reached out to his key creative who was hell bent on leaving when he took over a new role and gave him the comfort to tryb3 more months and created that trust again to keep him 20 years later. Break hon glass initially. Be respectful and listen. Treat people with respect. Went into a turn around all guns blazing and he was right but it was irrelevant because the tin and approach were off. Words were right music was off. That almost killed him in his first exec role. He had to do a hard reset on his role to recover some lost goodwill. How to win friends and influence people is about taking a genuine and sincere interest and caring about other people. Put yourself in others shoes first draw other people out and serve people. Listen to others so you know what they want.
- Cleaning Up Balance Sheets: The Story of Dunkin Donuts
  Key takeaways:
  - Companies with off-topic assets can clean up their balance sheets by making simple choices
  - Dunkin Donuts was a successful asset with undisciplined spending by the founding family
  - The market cap of Dunkin Donuts was $350 million and could have tripled the EBITDA overnight
  - Failed attempt to privatize Dunkin Donuts resulted in someone else buying it and it becoming worth $3 billion
  - Deals like Dunkin Donuts are rare and have disappeared from the marketplace
  - Companies with the largest asset growth percentage tend to be the worst performing in the market
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  When I started my career, you would still see companies where they own assets that were off topic and their balance sheets were screwed up and some simple choices would clean things Up. I looked at a company, actually I can say the name of the company. When I was a Vestron, actually, my boss Austin first was a wealthy individual and he was interested in perhaps doing a lot of work. And perhaps doing some private equity. We didn't call it that in those days. And so my corporate development team, Johnny Sburn and David Friedensen found a really interesting asset, which was Dunkin Donuts. It was a public company, but it was still controlled by the founding family up in Massachusetts. And it was ridiculously successful. And the family had gotten very undisciplined, I should say, about how they spent their money. And so they had resorts, planes, huge asset creep. And it was very lumbering and inefficient. It was a screaming bargain. The market cap of the company was like $350 million. And it was clear to us that you could triple the EBITDA essentially overnight. And we tried to take it private. We failed because we just weren't experienced enough to pull it off. But we did put it in place. Someone else bought it. And that's exactly what happened. And within a couple of years, it was worth $3 billion. You don't see deals like Fenn anymore. They just don't exist. They've been driven out of the marketplace.
  Speaker 2
  It's fascinating to think back on my quantitative days. One of the hardest to explain empirical phenomenon was that companies that had the largest percentage growth of their assets were the worst performing companies in the market. ([Time 0:38:14](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b7ab6d21-6eee-4d6f-9e80-392b3858042a))
    - **Note:** He came into take 2 for a turn around and was constantly tested. The company was under investigation by every authority possible and he cleaned it up. He set the tone when someone infringed on his ip used his legal knowledge to give a reasoned case instead of suing with no clear direction. Right sized costs. In a turn around it’s important to shift the culture but a lot of companies are run well. Important to invest in ip for the long term. While video games is hit driven new hits are usually off the beaten path and ideosyncratic. Requires creativity and counter intuitiveness not keeping the path. Creativity is non linear and you need to walk blind through a Forrest at times willingness to take big risks and embrace failure.
- Technologies Role in Platform Shifts: Risks and Opportunities
  Key takeaways:
  - Decision-making under uncertainty is a fascinating topic area.
  - Technology plays a significant role in the introduction of new platforms.
  - Being late to a platform doesn't necessarily harm intellectual property.
  - Being first to a marketing idea or platform doesn't provide significant benefits in the content business.
  - Keeping all options open is important in business.
  - Being where the consumer is matters.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Decision making under uncertainty is a fascinating topic area. And I'm curious how to zoom it in on take two specifically. How you've thought about technologies role through the introduction of new platforms. So you had the console cycle that you rode for a while. Then there's mobile and obviously you own Zinga now. So you have a mobile free to play presence. There's other looming potential platform shifts right now. A couple of them that are fascinating. How do you think about an approach, those things as both risks and opportunities for the business and the franchises?
  Speaker 1
  We stay away from huge pronouncements and massive shifts in the absence of market evidence. Because if you own intellectual property that matters, you can be late on a platform and still be just fine. You don't have to be the first to the party with a marketing idea or platform support, although we often are. You don't really get paid for that. If you're in the content business, you get paid for the content. I'm a believer that in business, if you don't have to vote, don't vote. If you don't have to make a choice, don't make that choice. Keep all your options open. We try to be where the consumer is. We try to use every distribution method that we can. We try to be ubiquitous. We're not the kind of people to think about. If I shut down all of this over here and I have that, I can drive more margin there. I'll worry about how to get the consumer there. We think about, let's have the broadest possible business. Let's meet the consumer where the consumer is. Let's drive margin where we can and acknowledge that in certain other instances, as long as the margin is acceptable, it may be a bit inferior to margin in other areas, but on balance,
  Speaker 2
  We want to have the largest possible pie. If you think about the whole business, what is something that people believe about take two to be true that isn't true?
  Speaker 1
  I think these days, pretty much people have gotten the memo. I think there was a period of time where people believed that my stated desire to be a friend's talent combined with our decentralized approach meant that I had no clue what our labels Were doing and they would just tell us what they're doing and then we would have to live with it. That completely misunderstood what actually goes on, which is we have a highly communicative and deeply intertwined senior management team across label and corporate. We have a lot of creative independence at the labels and frankly, independence among executives because people are given jobs to do. We want them to do their jobs the way they see fit. But we have lots of communication. I'm a fan of saying I believe in delegation with communication. Among the most dangerous words you can say at a corporation are, I don't care how you do it, just do it. That's great. That's how you end up being non-compliant. That's how you end up tanking your company. That's how you over leverage your company. That's how you go bankrupt. That's how you go to jail. I do care how you do it. I really care how you do it. You have to do it in the right way. It has to be consistent with our strategy. It has to be consistent with our culture and it has to be legally compliant and ethically compliant. Everyone knows that. But I do believe in delegation. I just want to know what's going on. When there's a problem, I want to be the first call. The first call. I am including the middle of the night. Even recently, I will occasionally have people inside the organization. Now we're a big organization. If you include ZMC, it's a very big organization. I would people say, here's what's going on. ([Time 0:54:56](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d498600d-0032-4f6d-a20f-bf27f590e20c))
    - **Note:** You need to weigh options but you also meee to make decisions under uncertainty. Maintain optionslity all you can but you get paid to make decisions under uncertainty you can’t freeze. Wants to hear things first. Decentralized but communicative organization. Wants to hear about the problem but can’t he’ll just respond reasonably and ratoonllly. Innovation is being the first to a technology and creativity is new ideas. Highly communicative organization. Wants to hear bad news up front and solve problems and won’t shoot the messenger in order to keep that good will despite working in a highly decentralized org.
