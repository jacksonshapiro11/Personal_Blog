### Highlights

- The Impossible
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Reminded me, it was very similar. Edwin Land, founder of Polaroid, he went back, I think it was MIT where he gave a lecture about the problems with the education MIT. In short, he talks about like anybody, it eliminates the ability, the student's ability to think he can be truly great is the summary. I talk about it in one of the podcasts. I think it was the book insisting on the impossible. Maybe founders were 40 something in there. But anyways, he also has this great quote that's very similar to what Ogilvy just said. And Edwin Land said, there's a rule they don't teach you at Harvard Business School. It is, if anything is worth doing, it's worth doing to excess. This is a different letter. Actually, no, this is a speech that he gave him. A Kinsey company. He was a good friend and he admired McKinsey's founder, Marvin Bowe, Bauer, I think is the guy's name. But he says, I begin with an old fashioned affirmation. This is on combining hard work, vacations, and laughter. I will begin with an old fashioned affirmation in the supreme value of hard work. The harder you work, the happier you'll be. I believe in the Scottish proverb, hard work never killed a man. A man, man, men die of boredom, psychological conflict, and disease. They never die of hard work. I am a stickler for ([Time 0:37:04](https://share.snipd.com/snip/dfaabf12-bc06-4e92-9c29-fc3047bd31e5))

  Advertising that only relies on lowering on like a temporary sales. He does not like deals and price cuts. He thinks anybody could do that. There's no talent in it. Any damn fool can put on a deal. But it takes a genius, or excuse me, but it takes genius faith and perseverance to create a brand. There used to be a prosperous brand of coffee called Chase and Sanborn. Then they started, then they started dealing. They became addicted to price offs. Where is Chase and stubborn today? In the cemetery, debt is a doornail. Promotions cannot produce more than a temporary kink in the sales curve. Why are so many brand managers addicted to price cutting deals? Because the men who employ them are more interested in next quarter's earnings than in building brands. Why are they so obsessed with next quarter's earnings? Because they are more concerned with their stock options than the future of their company. Deals are a drug. Sound an alarm. Advertising. Not deals builds brands. Another theme that comes across in speeches, letters, memos, this idea that you need to relentlessly pursue excellence. It is also the duty of our top people to sustain unremitting pressure on the professional standards of their staff. They must not tolerate sloppy plans or mediocre creative work. In our competitive business, ([Time 0:40:04](https://share.snipd.com/snip/16c1eec3-7660-4a47-94fc-10f91bd28c13))

    - **Note:** Don’t cut prices build brands. Hire great people and pay them more than yourself. Do everything to excess. Repetition is persuasive. First class business first class way. Have very high standards. Work for people you admire. Set high standards or fire people. Trial by fire. Corporations should encourage their maverick’s leadership isn’t learned in business school. Great leaders never pass the buck aren’t pretty symbolize innovation and unorthodoxy. Great leaders exude self confidence. Committed to the craft not lazy or amateur. Hates amateur. Test of a leader is after you leave them are you inspired with confidence.

Number two, he works harder than his peers and he enjoys it. Number three, he has a brilliant brain, inventive and unorthodox. Number four, he has an engaging personality. Number five, he demonstrates respect for the creative process. He writes a lot about corporate culture. This is a good description of culture. It's very tribe-like. The people who built the companies for which America is famous all worked obsessively to create strong cultures within their organizations. Companies that have cultivated their individual identities by shaping values, making heroes, spelling out rights and rituals, and acknowledging the cultural network have an edge.
