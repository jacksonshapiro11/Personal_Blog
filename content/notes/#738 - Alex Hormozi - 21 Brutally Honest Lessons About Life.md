### Highlights

- Live a life authentic to you. Some difficult things happen when you have to declare everyone else is wrong and crazy and I’ve done the work to justify my decision but you’re saying everyone else is wrong. The world is fighting to make you average do 100 days of rejection where you ask for something crazy get rejected and realize you’re not dead everything is ok the world is just a game. Don’t find people who say you’ve changed find people who are happy to have seen you’ve grown. People want you to conform you either conform externally and compromise internally or be your unique eccentric self and realize by doing this you’ll alienate people around you and you need yo accept this is ok that nothing is better than loving a love unique to you or worse than being different be someone you’re not. Can’t do the same thing as everyone else and expect above average results. Self acceptance and a life unique to you. The only success is radically independent thinking and contrarian action which only comes through self acceptance/ understanding deep trust in yourself and doing the work to get comfortable. Never trace your integrity for anything there is no return policy on integrity.

  At least for me, like there's this period of discomfort when you change anything because everyone around you wants you to fit within the label that they are comfortable with. But they also have the anchor of what you were before. Yeah, exactly. And so they try and like, people don't like that. And so they're like, no, no, I like you in this box. So just say, I know you're having a little thing right now. Don't worry. Just just, and they just want to shove you back ([Time 0:31:55](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2e896795-9004-48f9-9548-93f972bd1672))
- True authenticity is timelessly not cringe. Pandering, especially for personal gain, is always cringe. Do something that hurts you but you do it because you believe so deeply in it. Don’t be fake. Be authentic be aligned with what you think say and do. This usually means we need to reprogram our thoughts. People would rather be hated and unknown.

  Speaker 1
  I was thinking like, what creates like, what's what's timelessly not cringe? Right. So like if cringe is the ultimate, like what we don't want, then like, what is forever not cringe? And the only thing that can like really think of is just true authenticity, which is an overused word, but again, easy to say hard to do. I think what is what is forever cringe on the equal opposite side is is pandering. Like whenever you're seen as someone who's only doing stuff for other people's opinion approval, likes whatever, especially double cringe when it's for your own personal gain. And so if the equal opposite of that is something that is to my personal detriment, that is truly something that I believe in, it honestly doesn't matter what it is. Because there are some people that probably believe things that I don't believe, but I genuinely think, based on what I see, that they genuinely believe it. And it's, and they don't really stand to gain much for believing it. There's no cringe there. ([Time 0:48:21](https://share.snipd.com/snip/08a06da2-c02f-4342-932d-89bde99aca52))
- **Essences of an Attractive Man**
  * Three key essences of an attractive man are comfort in one's own skin, a clear sense of direction, and the ability to have fun.
  * Possessing even one of these traits can make someone attractive.
  * Someone with a strong sense of direction will attract followers, even if they lack fun or self-comfort.
  * Inner comfort alone can be attractive, regardless of direction or fun.
  * While fun can attract people, the other two essences are generally preferred.
  * Find someone who fits you

  Weird and like, you might not get second dates. But real real, you're not going to want the second date to because they're not like you. Like, when you get unplugged, you're like, Oh, wow, everyone's a sheep. This is weird. And you just go on a zillion first dates to be like, you had another one, you had another one. And every once in a while, you see a glimmer in someone who they're like, Oh, you think for yourself, like you can make your own conclusions. I remember when Layla and I went on our first date, we were, we went at a frozen yogurt store. And so of course, I'm like, so you know how they make their money here, right? I was like, so these things weigh this, they charge this per ounce. And I was like breaking this whole thing down. And she was like, Oh yeah, and they do this and this. And I was like, wait, you see this too? Like you, it wasn't like just like Alex just talking about this.
  Speaker 2
  Like the fuck in sixth sense or whatever.
  Speaker 1
  Oh, we're so excited because normally I would just have to like talk, I would talk about the stuff that at least I like to talk about because then we pass the not good dating strategy.
  Speaker 2
  I'm just saying you want to tell myself.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah. But then she also like talk about the stuff and I was like, holy shit.
  Speaker 2
  Well, what's the alternative? The alternative is to find someone who falls in love with a role that you're playing. Right. That's the best that you can hope for. Right. And then lock yourself in to a future of having to perform in a way that this person has become accustomed to.
  Speaker 1
  And there's nothing they can be more lonely than I can possibly match and then pretending every single hour of every day that you're someone you're not.
  Speaker 2
  Do you know who Dr. Robert Glover is? He wrote No More Mr Nice Guy. No, but I like the title. I had him on the podcast last week. This guy is a fucking boss. So cool. Like mid 60s or something now, huge goatee. Smoked cigarettes. Probably probably rip starts. This office, by the way, is completely, it's like smoking enabled in Vegas. And he had three essences of an attractive man. I think it's a really lovely frame. The essence of an attractive man, he's comfortable in his own skin. He knows where he's going. And he has fun while he's going there. Nailed. Nailed. So good. So good. But like that.
  Speaker 1
  If you think about that is, okay, so if you're in like even like an attractive man, whether you're married or not, like, I mean, on the flip side, it's like, do you want to be married and Then choose to become unattractive? Well, no, of course not. And so it's like, if those are three ideals, it's like you have direction in your life. You're internally comfortable. And the fun part is what makes you, I mean, partially attractive. And now mind you, if you just have one of the three, you can, you will find a mate who's attracted. Like if you just know with all your fucking soul, you're going somewhere, people will want to rally behind you. Even if you're not having fun. And even if you're not that comfortable. You got 10 kids. Right. And even if you're not that comfortable on your own skin, but you're like, that guy, like, no matter what, he's gonna fucking get there on the flip side. If you don't know where you're going and you don't even have much fun, but you're like, that guy is comfortable. Like say what you want, but that guy is good with him. That's in a, like, that'll look like if you just had one. And if you just have a shitload of funny, don't know where you're going and you're not that comfortable. Like you'll still have people. I'd probably prefer the first two to the third, but you know, but like as ideals, like fuck, very strong. ([Time 1:17:07](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8b99596f-e24e-4c7f-a49f-62b103703566))
- **Responding to Criticism**
  * If the criticism is true, agree and improve.
  * If the criticism is false but damaging, counter it by being louder with the truth.
  * Don't hide or dissociate after making a mistake; continue engaging.
  * You can only be canceled if you stop creating content or if all communication channels you don't control remove you. Take what they say and one up them.

  Speaker 1
  I think so I was trying to think about like the what are counter examples. So like if someone attacks your character, right? So let's say someone comes out and says, Alex did some sort of sexual allegation or something like that that I know isn't true, whatever, but they say that now that's going to besmirch My reputation, right? Now I can't be like, you're right. And if you really know, right? So I can't if you knew the half of it. So like, so like those are the situations, right? So like if someone just says like, you're, you know, you're full of shit or your business advice is bad or whatever, then that's one thing. But in those situations, the only counter that I have seen is to be louder. And so if someone increases the volume on something, I don't believe that you draw attention to that person. I actually I've more or less not been in the, I'm going to address someone directly, but I may counter what this person says without addressing them and be 10 times bigger and louder about It as a way to counteract that. And so like I had a bad reputation in college, which I've shared some of that in my story before. And the reputation was that I was a flander and was, you know, all about girls and whatever. And so I wanted to not have the reputation. And so it wasn't like I was going to go talk to those girls and be like, I need you to recant your story. I had to make my actions so much louder that I was no longer going to be that way for an extended period of time to counteract that thing. And so if we're thinking about like how to respond to people being shitty to you, if you believe what they say, and it's true, agree and one up, if what they say is something that isn't true, But does besmirch your reputation, then you can only be respond by being louder with the truth. And I think that like, I think about these things, obviously we're in a position we have to deal with this all the time. As like almost playbooks for dealing with shots.
  Speaker 2
  Well, this is one of the things that people got wrong about Dave Portnoy's cancellation. So even though I got canceled, Dave had sex with maybe two or three girls that sold the story. No, separately. Oh, okay. Sold a story to the Atlantic, I think, Pussynam sold a story to someone and they were looking around. I think they're still going. I'm pretty sure that only a couple of months ago, they tried to notify some pizza event that he was doing. Do you know that we're investigating him about that? And then he called them out. So what's happened is there's been a million, me two allegation things that we've come across. People saw the way that Dave Portnoy responded. He came out with the fences. Absolutely swinging. Like swinging so hard said, this is fucking bollocks. It's baseless. I think he maybe even somehow had video evidence or audio evidence or some kind, maybe internal CCTV cameras. Basically, all of this stuff is dog shit. Yeah. People took. Dave Portnoy didn't take any shit and he didn't back down and he didn't do an apology and he didn't do the rest. It's like, yeah, guess why? Because he didn't do it. Right. Because he wasn't in the wrong. If you are the guy that did do the thing, you don't have that. That's a firm foundation.
  Speaker 1
  What you're doing there is just creating this like cathedral of lies and dog shit on top of a sand castle of lies and dog shit, which will then get found out and you'll get hit. You'll get slimed 10 times way way way harder. Rightfully so to be fair.
  Speaker 2
  But that's it. That's the thing. So learning. Okay. Why did he do this particular tactic? Well, he ran that play because the basis of where he was at allowed him to loud a shit about the truth.
  Speaker 1
  One thing that we talked about earlier with canceling and I have so relatively contrary and views on canceling. I genuinely believe that you cannot be canceled. You only are you can only be canceled in two ways. You can be canceled if you choose to stop making content, stop being public or all means and methods and channels of communication that you do not control remove you from it. So like, for example, there's Tate, right? And he had his like he's not allowed to be on the platforms, but they allow his content be on the platform. So has he been canceled?
  Speaker 2
  No, I would argue not. And it's still other platforms. And he continues to make content.
  Speaker 1
  So you only so to me, this is actually really, I don't know, heartwarming security feeling. I get warm and fuzzy around that reassuring. Thank you. Because it means that cancellation is you have to agree to be canceled. No matter how bad like if you mess up platform, yeah, apart. Yeah. If they if they if they had AI face recognizing him and of limited from the platform, he would be canceled. Like there's no method of communication outside of a person who would have no leverage agreed. But barring that, if you continue to make content, no matter what you did, people will find out about you. More people will know it about you and your message will get disseminated. And whether you choose to like recant something that you did or you know, look right or wrong, apologize or do what Dave did and say like, this is complete bollocks. He's my little UK term and just be even louder. You choose to be canceled. And I like that because I like to have as many things under my controls.
  Speaker 2
  Yeah. I've been like thinking about the Streisand effect because everyone's always said, you know, cancellation makes people bigger. I think that is cope. I think it's massive cope. I don't think that cancellation makes people bigger. Alex Jones, for instance, when he got he got about as close to unpersoned, I think, as you can get very, very difficult. I wasn't seeing for the last whatever five years, eight years, whenever he got taken off Twitter, I wasn't seeing him on YouTube unless he was on somebody else's show. I wasn't seeing him on Instagram. I wasn't seeing him on Twitter. Steve will do it as a good example as well. Like he can't even be in the background of other people's YouTube videos. And he's got shares in Rumble and he's doing all of this other stuff. But still, that's a pretty big unpersoning. And I think it's kind of cope to say, oh, but so many more people are searching them. The entire internet is built on convenience. Yeah. If you think that making it more inconvenient for someone to access someone makes them bigger, you are fundamentally forgetting human nature. Now, maybe in this, you know, beautifully utilitarian, rational view of the world, the person that wants to see the thing, they might go and get the thing. But it's like, hey, guess what? Like TikTok's got an unlimited scroll. Yeah. And they're just going to keep going. And if they don't appear, they don't appear.
  Speaker 1
  And to draw this into IRL for everyone who's like, okay, well, that might be convenient for Alex Jones and whatnot. Like he can't, or he can't or he can't be canceled, whatever. I think that, at least for me, the throughline on this is like, if you do some embarrassing thing, which happens, we're human. The only ([Time 1:29:01](https://share.snipd.com/snip/24a96f89-72c6-4976-b30e-8448282f543e))
- Character is built from tough times when we look back at who we were 10 years ago and put ourselves into the mind of that person we not only measure our growth but realize how all our fears are transitory. When should we continue to push vs pivot and switch it up. If there is no new information then you must push. The world is won by people who put in work without realizing orvseing the results of their work for the longest period of time. You compound slowly and keep the faith then blow up all at once. The longer you can heads down keep at it the quicker you’ll be successful. Most people die because they quit. The elite come in every day despite being bored. Voting makes you rich. How we respond to hard and boring defines us. If we do something hard for us good because it’ll be just as hard for everyone else. There are no shortcuts to success at the beginning no one will believe and you must believe in yourself. Root for yourself before anyone else does. People struggle to do things alone. The beginning is the hardest part because you’re alone you need to do everything you have no help and you can burn out here because once you start compounding everything becomes easier.

  So there's a there's a handful of questions that I think everyone faces that you never know the right answer to. And so it's like, how much is the right amount to invest versus consume is one of those answers. Like, if you invest, if you consume nothing and you invest everything into it tomorrow, you end up with a life where you enjoyed nothing and then you have a big pile of delayed gratification Exact. Extreme results and no gratification. Right. And so like there, these are these are rather than either ([Time 1:45:25](https://share.snipd.com/snip/42e4b474-6169-4e85-ac75-c7646d418155))
- Earning your stripes through hard work and experience builds a deep understanding of your field. This allows for more insightful conversations and better decision-making, even in areas outside your core expertise. Dont expect it to be easy it’s the hardest at the beginning. The ground work is the hardest and it’s built at the beginning and compounds over time. When you win in the weeds you compound faster. Have a larger narrative about where you’re going is what keeps you going make yourself the hero of your story this is what fires you through in your darkest times. Be the hero in your own story and make the decision that serves that story and arc most. When you’re at an inflection point find out what the hero of your story you’re actively writing would do then take that action.

  I've always loved earning my stripes with the things that I've done, whether it was with Nightlife or running the podcast or doing whatever. And I think there's like a degree of nobility to it. But functionally, that's kind of, that's just like it's a nothing like what's the, where is the nobility? But I think the reason that you can feel noble about it and the reason that it gives you a positive reward is you know that you understand every single inch of the things and that if you want To hold a conversation, we went out for dinner with our new CFO and accounts people on Saturday and they said, you ask a lot of questions. Most people don't ask very many questions. And I ([Time 2:01:07](https://share.snipd.com/snip/416b9862-458c-4e62-a150-0f13ee14437f))

- **Cynicism is Short-Term Thinking**
  * Cynicism offers short-term validation by being right about what _doesn't_ work.
  * However, it sacrifices long-term gains by neglecting the potential for big wins. You only need to be right once but you need to accept a lot of failure in the short term for the one moment when you’re really right and it changes your life completely
  * Most people will be right that you’ll fail because today you might but they’ll be very wrong about all the other times you apply your principles consistently and achieve long term success. The world belongs to optimists.
  * Never sacrifice your piece of mind. Never Lie tell the truth all the time so it carries weight. Don’t say things you don’t mean. Make the words you say real. Tell uncomfortable truths.
  * Don’t compensate for happiness no pill will make you happy. Don’t reject those problems that’s just your life. Accept reality there is nothing wrong. 
  * If you knew what you were doing you couldn’t grow.

  You can always defend no like we we actually do with this a lot at equisor.com from an investment perspective and we actually have to check ourselves which is it's always easy to find A reason not to do an investment so we have a no bias then you should have an i mean you should overall have a no bias like you should say okay here's all the things that could go wrong and you Have to kind of think that we have to manage risk but if you say no to everything you're always right in the short term but you're but if you never make an investment you're wrong in the one Way that matters which is you get no return and so like you always miss the short term losses but you lose the big long term gain and so it's again this is a continuum to be managed more than A problem to be solved but cynicism is short term it's like every so when you so okay this is so when you go home right and you want to start a new business or you have a girl that you're bringing Back and your friends and your family are like she's not gonna last or like this isn't gonna this isn't gonna be forever they are right literally every single time except for the one time You bring your wife home and in that time they're all wrong and it's the one time that fucking matters and so the idea like but the thing is is because of the false positives or the true positives They might have been right literally 19 out of 20 times and if they were right the first time and the second time and the third time and the fourth time why would they bet against no on the Fifth time or the 50th time but you only need one yes or one positive to change your entire life and so there's this habit and that's where cynicism comes from where we get so many positive Reinforcers for saying no and being right but it's only short term being right because you have to make big bets to win big and that also means that you're wrong plenty of times and people Aren't willing to look stupid for being wrong this school bet could go wrong i'm betting it's not but everything has risk and i've been public about it right and so like if anything but Like i've played this out so like i like i'll tell you how i played this out i was like if it goes wrong i'll document the things that i that i learned and then i'll apply next time and i'll Do what i've always done state the facts and tell the truth ([Time 2:46:19](https://share.snipd.com/snip/aeb0dd94-f324-4ed9-9a14-c31faf44be8e))
