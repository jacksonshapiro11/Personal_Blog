- Building a business like a platform that has increasing returns like network effects is key to building a long term sustainable business flywheel. Intangible is strategic assembling of intangible building blocks that others could have as well in a novel way which leads to winner take all markets with quick obselance. Rival goods things that must be owned by someone non rival goods things that can be owned by more than one person at once some non rival goods can be excludable meaning you can see benefits from intangibles. Borrow and recombine ideas. Learn by doing the more you do the more you learn. Wrights law every doubling of output your cost per unit goes down 20%. The more you do the more you learn.

- The 2% Rule: Success in Investment
  Summary:
  Research shows that in the last century, 60% of companies failed to earn Treasury bill rates, leading to a loss of $9 trillion, while the top 2% of companies created 90% of the $55 trillion wealth.
  This pattern is consistent globally with 64,000 companies analyzed worldwide. As an investor, the focus should be on identifying companies that create value, as a few high-performing companies can significantly impact an investment portfolio.
  The approach in investment discussions revolves around being optimistic, seeking out potential successes, maintaining exhaustive research efforts, and ensuring commitments are followed through till the end without losing out on opportunities.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  The basic setup is he looked at all public companies since 1926 and what he found was just under 60%. So he's just got to let that number sit in your head 60% fail to earn treasury bill rates. So by his reckoning, they destroyed $9 trillion of wealth. The other little over 40% did create value. They earn above treasury bill rates and they created an aggregate $64 trillion of wealth. These numbers are through 2022, by the way. And so 64 months nine is $55 trillion of aggregate wealth creation, US market in the last called century or so. But what's fascinating to your point, Patrick, and this is where the venture capital ask statistic is that 2% of those companies created 50 trillion of the 55 trillion. So 2% of the companies were 90% of value. You can even go down a bit. The handful of companies were actually a fairly substantial percentage, including Apple and so forth. So obviously venture, the average bill, I think, said it's expanding out. But let's say the average venture fund is 10 years, but we have data on the returns for 30,000 venture investments over the last quarter century or so. And yeah, 55 or 60% lose money. It's actually not dissimilar at all. And then you get some that make money and then you got your right tails that pull up the whole portfolio. So as Bill mentioned, that you need to capture the extreme events to make the whole portfolio go. So one is looking at a century. And others looking at it's called a decade, but you're getting sort of the same essential, almost like a fractal pattern. The other thing to say is interesting is that best and binder also collaborate with some folks, academics, and looked at the same markets outside the United States. So they look at in aggregate, 64,000 companies, including developing and developed markets around the world. Same basic patterns help true. Really is interesting. So as an investor, obviously you say to yourself, if this is the pattern, I'm sure Bill and his colleagues think a lot about this, but if this is a pattern, how should we behave? That becomes the interesting question. Should we try to identify those companies? Do we want to make sure that we own those at the kind of errors we make, we have to own the guy. The companies are going to create all the value. Even if we own some of the bad ones, it doesn't really make a difference. If we own the good ones, it's going to make up for it all day and then some.
  Speaker 3
  If we were to be a fly on the wall in a Monday all day benchmark partner discussion with this topic in mind, what sorts of things does that then constantly bring up amongst you and your partners As you're considering an investment? Like if we're going to heed this truth and you just said you can't miss the huge ones and if you go into Coyle, they'll all talk about like be the person that finds the next logo that goes On that wall. This seems to be like the game that everyone's playing. What does that feel like tactically every Monday as you're talking about founders and customers? What are the sorts of questions that forces you to ask of young companies?
  Speaker 2
  So a couple of different things. One is just to embrace that attitude. I think Bruce came back from reading one of Ridley's book and used the phrase what could go right at a partner meeting. It's very easy, especially with a big group, with a group bigger than about five, it's very easy to fall into cynicism as a sport to start taking shots at stuff. And so having this what could go right at it to in other words, make the primary part of the discussion how big could this be rather than trying to nitpick whether or not it might fail. And so that's one. Two, I think it requires just exhausted behavior. You can't stop looking. How would you know that you looked under every rock? There's no way to know that other than to be exhaustive about it. And so creating a culture where everyone feels that responsibility is important. And then, you know, never lose at the finish line, never, ever, ever lose at the finish line. And once you've made a decision as a firm that it's something you want to be in, make it happen. How would you do that? Well, now you're getting into the secret sauce. Maybe give you like the saffron or like one ingredient in that. Well, I mean, you have to have built the right relationships. You have to call in the right favors from a refutational standpoint so that you're bringing the reference calls to the finish line. The tiresome don't lose on price.
