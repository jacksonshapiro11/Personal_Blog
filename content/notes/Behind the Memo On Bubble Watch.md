### Highlights

- **Bargain Hunting Requires Discipline**
  - To capitalize on market downturns, maintain cautiousness during periods of excessive optimism.
  - Avoid fully committing your capital during market bubbles to reserve funds for bargain hunting later.
  - Resist the fear of missing out (FOMO) and maintain high standards even when others abandon them.
  - Embrace "uncomfortably idiosyncratic" positions, as average bubble participants often face substantial losses during market corrections.
  - Recognize that buying low requires sellers driven by fear and prior high purchases.

  At Oaktree, we're known as bargain hunters, but it's important to remember that to access the inevitable dislocation, you need to have remained cautious during the prior period where Market sentiment's been overly positive. And that can be quite difficult to maintain that discipline. Absolutely.
  Howard Marks
  First of all, if you jump on the bandwagon, the same as everybody else, you'll use all your money to buy at elevated prices. And then when the bubble pops, you won't have any money to scoop up the bargains. Number two, your psyche will be shot. Having participated in what then turns out to have been a mindless pursuit in the bubble, you won't have the resolve. You'll lose faith in yourself. And when you can buy the same asset for a fifth the price, you'll say, but how do I know it's cheap enough? Just as you couldn't recognize when it was too expensive, you won't be able to recognize and get motivated when it's too cheap. We pride ourselves on bargain purchases. We say we're in business to buy assets for less than they're worth, but that requires cooperation from somebody else who's willing to sell it to us for less than it's worth. Why would anybody do that? The reason they do it is because they bought it higher. They've seen deterioration of the economy and the company and the earnings and their own psyches. They've seen the price collapse. They've lost confidence. Whereas when you bought it at 90, you were sure it was going to go to 200. Now that it has fallen to 50, you're not so confident that it's not going to go to 10. So you say, get me out at any price. I can't take it anymore. It's the reverse of FOMO. It's fear of continued irrational losses. However, now in order to have money left with which to buy up bargains when the bubble pops, you have to have had some in reserve. You have to have not been fully committed during the bubble. That's hard. Everybody else is making money. You don't want to miss out. It's hard to maintain high standards when everybody else around you is losing their standards and bidding for the new thing, even at prices that seem nutty. But you have to do that, or you can't be exceptional if you succumb to the influences that are dominating everyone. Dave Swenson, who ran the endowment at Yale with incredible success from 1985 to 2020, when he passed away, said in his book, Pioneering Portfolio Management, that investment management Requires the assumption of uncomfortably idiosyncratic positions. And I find uncomfortably idiosyncratic the two most beautiful words I ever heard, because let's take the example in a bubble. You must not succumb. You must not be an average participant in the bubble because the average participant gets eviscerated when the bubble collapses. Your behavior has to be idiosyncratic, which is to say you have to not participate or certainly not participate to the same extent of everybody else.
