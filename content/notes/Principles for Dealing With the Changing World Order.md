    - **Note:** First don’t lose then win approach. Diversify your tail risk maintain optionality and seek out disconfirming views and smart people
- Betting on the upward trend while making sure you keep playing the game. The arc of humanity is up only but that ride is bumpy and it’s tough to say where progress might come from we can expect linear extrapolations but we know exponential events happen and we need to adjust to them and prepare for them. While the line is up only the ride is everything but bumpy and some people can get fully taken out if they’re not looking
- All markets are driven by growth inflation risk premiums and discount rates because all investments are upfront payments today for future returns. People only study major economies but if you study without hindsight bias you see the world going wrong for a lot of people and the return profile and risk of ruin being higher. Creating credit pulls forward demand then eventually there’s a depression and everything crashes and people print fiat to make good in promises and eventually people lose trust in the system and it all blows up. 7 of 10 major powers in 1900 had wealth wiped out or near wiped out or had sustained periods of losses. Only us Canada and Australia survived. Financial money and financial wealth always increases faster than the claims on that asset and when things fall asset prices will go lower than their intrinsic value due to fear Payback periods on cash ie government bonds are the longest ever and not achievable given inflation destroying returns

    - **Note:** All investments are an upfront payment for something in the future and based on inflation risk premium and growth you get your expected return. One thing hidden in return assumptions is how often major economies have blown up 70% of major economies in 1900 went to zero so your basis for investing is completely sector dependent. Markets also oscillate between fear and greed mr market. Debt is pulling forward future demand.
      This is the same as the Ariel Durant quote. The price of assets will always go up faster than the actual claims than it blows up people print money to make good on promises the goal in life is to own productive assets only a fool holds cash and financial engineering provides little value eventually you need to produce value over time or returns will revert. Things always go lower than you think. The market current remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.
- Cycle 1. New internal order and leadership (Churchill or mao) 2. Build a new system that sets the country up for property (den xiou ping) 3. Piece and prosperity 4. Excesses start getting out of control and class and value struggle/gap emerges 5. Bad financial times and conflict 6. Civil war cycle restarts - leading indicator is a bankrupt government combined with big wealth gaps. Government is out of power. More to be sold then they have so either they raise taxes and cut spending or print money. The gap between the haves and have nots widen. Rise of populism aged bureaucracies that can’t do the obvious because they have so much technical debt. Wealth opportunity and value gaps between haves and have nots. The more populism the closer we are to class and civil war. Propaganda starts to spread and the gap widens media on witch hunts and cancels people spreads a biased story or only one side which creates conflict as acausation are thrown out and people are hurt and there is no truth. Economic prosperity is what keeps systems alive and helps establish new systems The world changes and systems need to change as well. Dividing the pie and creating win win relationships is better than civil war. New world needs new principals to govern it

    - **Note:** Big cycles rise from the ashes of chaos with a new visionary leader which is followed by the building of the system and peace but eventually things get out of hand and cracks turn into breaks and revolutions start because the people are no longer happy and the system no longer works and out of the ashes comes a new system and the cycle starts again. As long as the economy is good and peoples lives are improving they will stay happy but when this stagnates it'll lead to issues
      A mark of a late stage empire is there’s too much debt to do what is obviously. This is basically the same thing as scientific paradigms but with less human loss. In the late stages it’s clear the system isn’t working.
- 5 kinds of fights. Economic (tariffs) technology wars (sharing tech) geopolitical (conflicts over territory resolved without fighting) wars capital wars (economic sanctions limiting foreign access to capital markets) and military wars (this usually involves every other dimension)
- Understanding your balance sheet and the worlds balance sheet then stress test it. If your saving fell by x how liquid are you how much do you have in the bank to back your money up. Understanding the interplay here is important to understanding how other actors and the world will function. Debt eats equity and peoples decisions effect others chain reaction complex system. When money and credit is available investment is high and supply rises when money and credit is expensive it curbs borrowing and leads to recessions. This interplay is the money and credit cycle

    - **Note:** Understanding your financial position and margin of safety as well as the macro margin of safety is important when investing.
- When 3 big cycles come together in different ways. Heavy indebtedness leading to money printing and driven by one or more internal internal social or class conflicts about how to split up the pie with the rise of another power there is a high likelihood for a change in the world order and a decline in the incumbent. The determinants cause other things to happen big game of dominoes that runs the perpetual motion machine Cycle of capital markets internal order driven by money and values gaps and external order driven by rising powers next 2 most important forces are pave of innovation and natural disasters force majure

    - **Note:** Heavy debt, money, printing, and relevant alternatives can lead to big changes
- Value of a country in terms of wealth and power 1. Education 2. Competitiveness Innovation + tech economic output Share of world trade Military strength Financial center strength and reserve currency status Good countries have strong incentive alignment and people use hard work to get what they want/ where they want to go. People build then reach excess take too much debt stop creating and collapse
    - **Tags:** #incentive-structures, #wealth-and-power
    - **Note:** Good countries create systems that incentivize growth and creation. Wealth and power are the same thing
- The biggest struggle is the ability to make take and distribute wealth and power through ideology and religion. The people have the wealth work with the political elites to produce more wealth 3 points long term debt cycle and internal and external order and chaos cycles govern humanity. Evolution is the upward move toward improvement as a result of education and learning. Evolution is slow and steady while cycles are abrupt and painful. People grow because of intelligence inventiveness education and the ability to monetize or better a good incentive structure. Capitalism money comes from inventiveness Countries with low debt good leadership and smart populations can be more successful than other populations

    - **Note:** Biggest struggles are a result of fighting for wealth and power. Societies move forward because they innovate and maintain optionality through low debt and good leadership and allocate resources effectively like capitalism. human nature is cyclical but tech is linear, this is the cornerstone of much of the world's problems. Were using the old hardware on increasingly dangerous problems then eventually when we learn we die. These ideas are similar to the sovereign individual idea of the future
