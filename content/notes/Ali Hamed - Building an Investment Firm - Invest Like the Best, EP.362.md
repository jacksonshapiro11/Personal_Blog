### Highlights

- Episode AI notes
  1. The risks of regulated capital and old asset classes in credit investing can lead to decreased yields and competition from regulated organizations, making it challenging for credit investors to earn money based on risk.
  2. Discipline and rigor in asset-backed credit are essential to avoid linear thinking and distinguish noise from signal, conducting thorough diligence and focusing on markets adjacent to ones previously explored.
  3. Feeling needed in work is important for ambitious individuals in investing, who find joy in creating value for others and impacting many people through ventures that solve complex problems. ([Time 0:00:00](https://share.snipd.com/episode-takeaways/010a5797-80b8-4a18-9e90-3f393f042c10))
- The Risks of Regulated Capital and Old Asset Classes in Credit Investing
  Key takeaways:
  - The competition and bidding against mature asset classes like auto loans and student loans in capital markets can significantly reduce their yields over time.
  - Older asset classes that are rated and allowed for holding by regulated institutions have low returns due to cheap forms of capital, making it challenging for credit investors to earn money based on risk.
  - Blowups in credit often involve old asset classes while newer, properly structured and sized credit agreements tend to be less risky and more stable over time.
  - Seeking out small, overlooked markets in credit where regulated institutions can't yet finance can provide opportunities for higher returns compared to competing in crowded, mature asset classes.

  Speaker 1
  Like student loans, would you ever have a loved one own like student loans in their PA? Like probably not, $200,000 loan, consumer loans that earn like a four or five percent yield. Auto loans would like you ever want to own an auto loan in your PA, consumer loans. A lot of these really mature asset classes have just been completely destroyed by time. And why does time destroy them? Well, first off, there's a lot of people who have realized those asset classes are big, and so they bid against them, and they compete with each other in capital's commodity. So you have like one smart person trying to outsmart another smart person over like three or four basis points. The other is the older an asset class, the more it's had an opportunity to be price-based on how capital markets work, not based on its risk. What do I mean by that? Well, it's something like auto or student loans, they're rated. Why are they rated? Well, they're rated because they've been around long enough for a rating agency to build a base case of what they think default rates will be. They then can build a lost coverage ratio. They think default rates will be two percent, and they can incur six percent. That's like a three times lost coverage ratio. And credit people would think, well, gosh, isn't that so great? Three times lost coverage. Because they can be rated, they can be held by organizations that are regulated. A bank or an insurance company are examples of that. And banks and insurance companies have cheap forms of capital because they're regulated. What does that mean? Well, if I'm a depositor and I give my money to a bank, I don't require a lot of return from it. Why? Because they essentially assume it's guaranteed by the government. If I'm a retirement annuity holder or I own a life insurance policy, I don't require a high return from that. I don't exactly know how insurance works usually as the average policy holder. But I kind of assumed that, like, God forbid something happened, the government will step in and save me. The insurance company promised me and I didn't hear anything about how, like, the way my money is being used is investing risks. So, like, I'm sure it's guaranteed. So these two regulated forms of capital have cheap capital. Because these older asset classes are rated and rating agencies are tied to what regulators will allow these cheap forms of capital to hold, those asset classes have no return anymore. And so if you're trying to be a credit investor and earn money based on the risk you're taking, how are you supposed to compete against regulated organizations? So these older asset classes have largely just had, like, the yields taken out of them. And then where the yields haven't been taken out of them, say, in the residuals, like, the bottom equity piece of these lever structures or whatever, you have, like, a lot of really, Really smart people all competing over them. I just don't think that's a way to win in credit. And what's really interesting is if you think about, like, all the blowups in credit, it's almost always old asset classes. You never hear, not that we do income share agreements, for example, you've never heard anyone get blown up over income share agreements. You never hear of anybody getting blown up over something that was perceived to be risky because it's structured correctly, it's sized correctly, it's not over levered. And by the way, milk can figure this out in, like, corporate credit. It turns out that, like, it's more risky to do investment grade credit where you're not getting paid for your winners, so if you have one loss at, like, tanks your portfolio, and it was A lot less risky to do deals, we were getting paid for the risk, that with there were a couple of mistakes that you made along the way, you still got paid enough. Like, the same is true in asset back credit. It is much better to find somebody that nobody else is in where regulated institutions can't yet finance them, where you can pick the market before anybody else realizes it matters, And then find ways to crowd people out over time.
  Speaker 2
  What's a good recent example of, and I'm asking for a reason so that it's not a sure thing, of something that is small today, a market that is small that you could serve with credit today, That you think could become big, just to bring the idea to life?

    - **Note:** It’s much less risky to do some risky because you’re getting compensated vs traditional asset classes where the tail risk isn’t understood or contemplated so one blow up fucks you. Better to take risk and know you’re taking it in weird things then look at professional asset classes and compete over bps. Good investments are platform ecosystems like bad governance because the platform either buys or kills the next big thing or apps that have done well. When you want to be on the cutting edge you need to size your positions correctly and structure them well such that you make a lot on your winners and don’t lose a ton on your losers. Size to a few 100bps downside but captures the upside charge enough on winners so they compensate losers. Moral hazard and compete against dumb not smart people
- The Importance of Discipline and Rigor in Asset-Backed Credit
  Key takeaways:
  - Level of discipline and rigor in venture capital can be dangerous if too linear
  - Discipline helps in avoiding 'wrapping paper companies'
  - Diligence process involves believing in multiple factors and reaching 0.99% certainty on most
  - Invest in markets where it's not obvious and where you can recognize opportunities from previous experiences
  - Approach new investments with a focus on differentiated points of view and understanding the market thoroughly

  Speaker 1
  So that level of discipline and rigor and perfection, when applied to venture capital is dangerous because it causes you to be too linear. Convence yourself every trade has an issue with it. There's a reason not a lot of credit funds have become good at venture capital. Or credit business have become good at venture. But when it's at our best, it makes us really disciplined about not thinking about the noise and the signal and avoiding wrapping paper companies. A wrapping paper company to us is good founder, good syndicate, good market that's hot, vertical AI right now, but not the right company. Not a company with pricing power, not a company with barriers to entry over time, etc. And when we're at our best, it allows us to go through a very simple process. In each company that we're looking at, we have to ask ourselves, what are the things that we need to believe for the company to work? The hardest passes, and I'm guessing a lot of people listening to this can relate to it, is when you're talking to a founder and you believe everything that they're saying, but your gut Says don't do the deal. And why is that? It's usually when you're 90% sure of like 15 different things, but 0.9 to the 15th power is a really low number. And so our diligence process is how do we get to 0.99% on 12 of the 15 things and accept that there's going to be a lot of people who are going to be able to do that. And accept that there's going to be a few that we just don't know. We're not going to know TAM early on, especially in the markets that we invest in, because we try to avoid obviously consensus markets with a big TAM. Instead, we're trying to invest in markets where it's like an on obvious market. That's usually how you have less credit investments. So TAM is often one of them, quality of management teams, some of the management teams we've known for a long time. We certainly do diligence on management teams, but gosh, how well can you really get to know somebody in 90 days to six months? And how often is somebody who's a really, really good first employee somewhere or executive somewhere going to be a good founder? It's just hard to know. And the third is just sort of like philosophy of go to market, competitive set, etc. So we say, what are the 15 things? Then we ask ourselves, would we be good at those 15 things? Usually when we develop a new market, we're going to be in. It's next to a market that we already have been in before. So it's not like we're going to go from like when we got into new forms of media, we have been looking at specialty finance companies that were in original new asset classes. We came across YouTube as a new asset class. YouTube taught us about new forms of media, and then we did new forms of media. It's usually something that's one step away. And it's usually a space where we've seen 50 B's already, so we can recognize an A. And the third question we ask ourselves is, would this be a good use of our time? And usually when we see a deal in a market that we've never seen before, we just pass because either we can take too long to do diligence and we'll miss it, or we can do not enough diligence And make a bad investment. But if we keep seeing deals in that space, we start to ask ourselves like, hmm, maybe we should learn about that space. We keep seeing activity there. The ADU market, the California housing market was an example of that. We saw like seven or eight deals in the space. We kept saying no. And finally, we're like, you know what? There's a lot of smart people. It seems like a big market. Let's put boots on the ground. Go to Los Angeles. Talk to not real prop tech investors. Let's go talk to real estate developers. Let's go talk to real estate investors. Let's go to property managers and really understand what's going on here. And now when we see a deal in that space, we are prepared. We have a prepared mind. As simple as that is, if you kind of go through those three things and you think of yourself as a business that finds a good idea and then has to convince everybody else. It's a good idea. As opposed to just trying to originate deals, everyone else already knows is a good idea. There's a lot of profit margin in that.
  Speaker 2
  How do you approach something that will take the obvious one, which is AI, which is on everyone's mind, not just for investment opportunity, but for the ways in which it will affect their Portfolio. Their lives, whatever. How do you approach something like that with your investing hat on or how have you approached it?
  Speaker 1
  So the first is we don't think that you have to be the first investor in space to make the most money on it. If you were the first internet investor in the 90s, do you think you made more money than the best internet investors in the 2010s? Probably not. The second is we have to have a differentiated point of view. And right now our point of view is pretty similar to a lot of people. It's better to have a data mo. A lot of people have pitched these asset heavy infrastructure businesses because it's not enough chips. And so there's a chip shortage.

    - **Note:** Wrapping paper company good vertical good founder bad business. But understand what you need to believe for this to be a success. Understand the space step back don’t need to swing first but learn hang around the hoop before you develop a muscle. Consensus areas lead to failure. Be differentiated secrets.
- Importance of Feeling Needed in Work

  Speaker 1
  Ambicious people are better investors than non-ambitious people. One of the traits of ambitious people is their competitive. Competitive people want to play in the big leagues. They don't want to play in the minor leagues. And the way to play in the big leagues is to invest more capital because you're competing with better talent. And you want to prove you're the best at something. There's like natural gamification things being bigger and to be attracting better people. And by the way, if we try to build an organization, we promise people that we had no ambition. We wouldn't get ambitious people. And we probably would be worse at investing for it. So there's like reasons related to that. But for me personally, like Bezos has said this in a bunch of interviews, it feels good to be needed. If I sold this cup to you and you bought the cup, you'd be happy because you had the cup and I'd be happy because I sold the cup. And there'd be some manufacturer who made a cup for two minutes of their life and that'd make that time valuable. If I'm teaching a class and I don't show up to the class, how awkward that be. It's like a one to 50 relationship. 50 people would have wasted their time. They would have gone to class. They would have been confused. If you were given a lecture, I bet you'd feel like some value and importance of showing up and giving the lecture. And if you code an app, then like how great is that like thousands and thousands of people use this? Like one of the reasons that feel like people in technology when they're at their best do feel like they're making the world a better place. Even though that's become like a term that's made fun of now, which is kind of sad because they're able to like do something that took some amount of their time and impacted many, many People and changed the way that they operate. And when you invest, you get to invest in a bunch of people doing that. If your goal is to solve like a really complicated problem that has real life impact and feel needed a lot and like be a competitor, it's the best job in the world. I mean, I can't believe anyone would want to do anything else. ([Time 1:26:37](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d8a4ab21-73f0-47cd-b46f-b356601d9420))
