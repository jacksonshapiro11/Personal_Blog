- Summary: In this memo by David Mamet to the writing staff of "The Unit," Mamet discusses the importance of creating dramatic scenes in television writing. He emphasizes that the audience is not tuning in to watch information, but rather to watch drama. Mamet outlines three questions that writers should ask themselves about every scene: who wants what, what happens if they don't get it, and why now. He also advises against including unnecessary exposition and information, and encourages writers to focus on creating scenes that advance the plot and engage the audience.
