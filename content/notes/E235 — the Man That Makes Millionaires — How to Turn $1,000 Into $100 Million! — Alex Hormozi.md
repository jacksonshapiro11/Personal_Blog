### Highlights

- Inputs = outputs 
  Key takeaways:
  - Successful entrepreneurs need the ability to lead others, influence, and sell.
  - They also need a big motivator, the ability to practice impulse control, and the ability to identify the inputs and outputs that lead to success.
  - Entrepreneurs who possess these traits become very difficult to beat.

  Speaker 1
  They have a big mission that they really want to achieve or they have some very big fear that they're running away from. Either way, I think the fuel works just from a pure entrepreneurship perspective. Third piece is impulse control is that they have to be able to say no to things on a regular basis for an extended period of time. And I think they have to be able to boil down the success of their business into inputs and outputs. Like if you do not know the inputs that are going to get the output that you want, then what are you doing? And so I think for most entrepreneurs, like if they have those things, if they have the ability to lead other people, slash sell, just influence, they have some big motivator. They can control themselves long enough to keep on going during that period of time. And they are doing the right things because they know the inputs and outputs to be successful to create the thing that they want becomes a very difficult person to beat.

    - **Note:** Understand deeply the inputs and outputs of your business.
