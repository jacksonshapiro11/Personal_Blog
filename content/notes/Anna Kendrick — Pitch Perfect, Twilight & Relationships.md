### Highlights

- Recognizing the Unseen: The Complexities of Emotional Abuse
  Summary:
  Emotional abuse can present in ways that are easily overlooked, often making it difficult for individuals to identify or acknowledge their experiences.
  The complexities of such relationships may lead victims to question their own perceptions and justify harmful behaviors. The dynamic often involves a sudden shift in behavior, which can leave one grappling with feelings of confusion and self-blame.
  The difficulty in recognizing manipulation stems from the abuser's ability to convincingly portray themselves as a victim, reinforcing the victim's doubts about their own reality.
  Conversations about red flags in relationships can inadvertently shift the responsibility onto the victim, complicating their ability to recognize abuse that is obscured by emotional complexities.
  It is essential to understand that enduring emotions of shame or confusion long after exiting an abusive relationship is common. True healing entails stripping away self-blame and recognizing that context and external dynamics often play a crucial role in such situations.

  Speaker 1
  I didn't tell like my closest friends that I was making this movie about emotional abuse because I had just gotten out of a relationship that was extremely similar to the movie. Um, and I didn't want anybody to tell me to not do it like I didn't want to get talked out of it and I knew that there were good reasons for my friends and certainly my therapist to be like is This the best idea for you like right now um so I just kept telling them it's about like three friends in a cabin and like it's about like their relationships which in a way it is right but Um yeah I I like didn't even when after the movie was wrapped whatever like they didn't even know that it was about emotional abuse until like the trailer came out because I just didn't I just didn't want somebody to tell me well I don't know maybe this is the childhood thing of like I don't want you to tell me it's bedtime like I need to do this I'm gonna do this can I ask like How long did that um abusive relationship that you endured last um it was it didn't follow the traditional pattern which is kind of yet another reason why I was finding it really difficult To identify it and name it as abusive. Okay. Because I was like reading all the articles and going like, this doesn't look like some of it looks like how they're describing it, but not completely. And so the relationship was seven years. Okay. But it was like an overnight switch. And that went on for about a year. So it didn't follow more traditional like it's like a frog in boiling water thing where it started slow it came out of absolutely nowhere but was built on this foundation of I had so much Love and trust for that person so I thought it had to be me. Like I, if one of us is crazy, it must be me. So it was very, very difficult to actually go, no, this, I think this is, I think this is him. I think, I think this is his stuff. Because I turned my life completely upside down trying to fix whatever was wrong with me. And, you know, it didn't help that for a long period of time our, like, couples therapist, I think, just bought his stuff kind of hook, line, and sinker. And I've had several sessions with him in, you know, the last several years where he's apologized to me because I think he realized what was going on like right toward the end but yeah
  Speaker 2
  That obviously made everything a lot more complicated we always have to remember like therapists are human beings too and a lot of times they don't know the inner dynamics and if you Are with a very manipulative person though that is good in crowds like they can mask it pretty easily and you can be kind of painted to be the person that's like insane or you're unreasonable Or you're like unwilling to make the relationship work and when you have a licensed person staring at you next to the person that is abusive because we project so much authority onto
  Speaker 1
  Them even though we kind of know intellectually well they're just people right it's like I just want and it was also I just want someone to tell me what's happening like I wasn't I wasn't Even thinking like we're gonna go into couples therapy and he's gonna you know ream you out and it's gonna I was just like will someone just explain to me what's going on so uh yeah it was Uh it was full on was also interesting that, like, I always felt like I was trying to stay so calm in couples therapy because I was like, fuck, in these sessions, he's so able to kind of stay Calm in a way that he does not do when we're outside of therapy. And then there was a day again toward the end where I really kind of like lost my shit and I did think like oh my god like what have I done like what have I done like I can't it's gonna be so bad Now like what what did I do what do you mean what do you mean it's gonna be so bad like if things when I'm trying so hard to like appease this person yeah they're so fucking awful so how bad Is it gonna get now that I've like yelled it you know um and I sent after that session I first of all weirdly he was fine which was very weird very interesting because I think he felt like Maybe a little bit like calm because he was like see you're fucking crazy. So it was weirdly fine. But I sent the therapist an email being like, I'm so embarrassed. I'm so sorry. Like, you know, I need to control myself or whatever because I had yelled in this session. And he called me, which he hadn't done before, and was like, no, no. I'm so proud of you. And that's when I knew like, oh has shifted like something's changed and then yeah things ended pretty quickly after that I mean I appreciate you sharing this just because I have so many
  Speaker 2
  Women that listen that are like what are the signs and like I appreciate you how you opened the conversation about this topic about like, it literally changed overnight. And I was reading all the articles being like, is this me? Well, no, that's not me. You try to justify things. Like, do you mind sharing anything that maybe like my listeners could be like, oh, this this is happening to me, too, that like maybe doesn't present as like this is abusive and toxic.
  Speaker 1
  But the undertone is so there god it's so hard it's so hard and I well I don't know maybe I'll maybe I'll think of something but it's this conversation is even like really complicated for Me it's like even talking about it I can feel like my my body temperature growing up because I think that sometimes the conversation around like red flags, like those are important conversations That we should be talking about it, like thinking about it, looking for them, sharing with each other. Think that even the most well-meaning conversation sometimes about like red flags is can be a little victim blamey and which is hard because I'm like well also I want to know you know And share red flags um because it does sort of put the onus on you to be able to identify something that by the way, someone is working so hard to make sure you can't identify. Like, I really started thinking about it like, like if someone was raised from birth as like a wilderness survivalist and they just dropped you or, I mean, I don't know, maybe, maybe You have this in your background, but if they dropped you or me in the middle of the woods I would step into a booby trap within three feet yes because I don't know what to look for and it's ([Time 0:43:27](https://share.snipd.com/snip/88ff828f-f08a-4fa9-a093-c022f5b75643))
