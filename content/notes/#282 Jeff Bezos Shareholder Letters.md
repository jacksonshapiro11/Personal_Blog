- Amazon's Strategy for Accelerating the Online Commerce Process Through Personalization
  Summary:
  Amazon aims to save customers money and time by leveraging the internet to personalize the online commerce experience, accelerating the process of discovery.
  By creating real value and aiming to establish a lasting franchise, Amazon seizes the opportunity presented by new online customers and larger competitors entering the market. The strategy involves quick consolidation of the current position and expansion into other online commerce areas for substantial opportunities in targeted large markets.
  This approach necessitates significant investment and precise execution to compete with established leaders, with success measured by long-term shareholder value creation.

  Internet and if we execute well for Amazon, today online commerce saves customers money and precious time. Tomorrow through personalization, online commerce will accelerate the very process of discovery. Amazon uses the internet to create real value for its customers. And by doing so, hopes to create an enduring franchise, even in established and large markets. We have a window of opportunity as larger players marshal the resources to pursue the online opportunity and as customers, new to purchasing online are receptive to forming new relationships. Our goal is to move quickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the online commerce opportunities in other areas. We see substantial opportunity in the large markets that we are targeting. This strategy is not without risk. It requires serious investment and crisp execution against established leaders. We believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long term. The stronger our market leadership, the more powerful our economic model. Market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue, higher profitability, greater capital velocity, and correspondingly stronger returns on invested ([Time 0:02:32](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c4fe65c1-8117-4afe-8809-15d988db0773))
    - **Note:** Focused on shareholder value over the long term. Saw the internet as the moment to take advantage of the new trend but they needed to act fast and execute well against incumbents. They wanted to establish an enduring franchise over the long term. Focus on the customer bold rather than timid investment. Cost conscious culture and optimize for cash flows. Dogged focus and hiring A players only and doing this because it is a challenging but rewarding task.
- Why Jeff Bezos' Shareholder Letters are a Crash Course in Running an Internet Business
  Summary:
  Reading Jeff Bezos' shareholder letters provides a valuable opportunity to learn from someone who mastered running a high growth Internet business before established playbooks existed.
  Bezos' letters offer insights into the importance of repetition in entrepreneurship, with founders identifying key principles and consistently reinforcing them over time. The 1997 shareholder letter, considered the founding document for Amazon, emphasizes the significance of obsessions and the enduring nature of core business principles.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  That was an excerpt from Jeff Bezos' very first shareholder letter. This is the third time that I've read Jeff Bezos' shareholder letters. I plan on rereading them many times in the future. The first time I made a podcast about his shareholder letters was all the way back on episode 71. If you look at episode 71, the tag line, the description for that episode, I actually got from a fantastic business email newsletter called CB Insights. They had a post about Jeff's shareholder letters, and I think they put it the best way. Why would you want to spend so much time reading them and learning from them? They said to read Bezos' shareholder letters is to get a crash course in running a high growth Internet business from someone who mastered it before any of the playbooks were written. Before I go to the 1998 shareholder letter, which is all about obsessions, I just want to go over the notes that I had from 1997, just these things that I jotted down for myself, because The main theme of the shareholder letters is a main theme of the history of entrepreneurship, the fact that repetition is persuasive. Almost all of history's greatest founders, they identified a handful of principles that were important to them as they were building the business, and they constantly repeated that Decade after decade, and you're going to see that as we go through Jeff's shareholder letters. And it was so important that that 1997 shareholder letter was attached to every single, the end of every single other shareholder. It can be thought of as the founding document for Amazon. ([Time 0:06:38](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8b365bb0-cf3f-41f5-94aa-b369f64233d7))
    - **Note:** Repetition is persuasive find founding values and continue to reinforce them. Move quickly very risky and endure. Jeff thought 30% of success. Bold and frugal lean culture. Risks and opportunities are ahead rather than behind. They are customer centric and have constant improvement because they’ll leave if they don’t love the product. Sees himself as an inventor. Pioneers with relentless focus. Work hard and be relentless. Setting the bar high on hiring is a massive key. The bar has to continue to go up for the hiring group. Wants operational excellence and high efficiency over the long term.
- Jeff Bezos on Learning from Sony's Founder and How It Influenced Amazon's Vision
  Summary:
  Jeff Bezos learned from Sony's founder the importance of setting a mission that is larger than the company itself.
  By aiming to make Japan known for quality instead of just Sony, the founder inspired Bezos to envision Amazon as the Earth's most customer-centric company. This approach focuses on being a standard bearer for customer obsession rather than competitor-focused, aligning with Marita's strategy for Sony's reputation.
  Bezos adopted the concept of setting a grand mission that transcends the organization, leading to Amazon's customer-centric ethos.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  You're doing now. They're learning from the great people that came before them. This idea, this, this blew my mind, right? This idea of, hey, I'm going to create the world's, the one that he's talking about right here in the shareholder. I'm our vision is to use this platform to build Earth's most customer centric company. He learned that idea from the founder of Sony, a keya marita, I covered his autobiography, which is absolutely fantastic. All the way back on founders 102, if you haven't listened to it, let me pull out another. This is something I heard Jeff saying. I know what I took on this conversation he had. And so the night, the night left myself here is Jeff Bezos on what he learned from a keya marita and how it influenced the building of Amazon right after World War II, a keya marita, the Guy who founded this is Jeff talking right after World War II, a keya marita, the guy who founded Sony made the mission for Sony that they were going to make Japan known for quality. And you have to remember, this was a time when Japan was known for cheap copycat products. And marita didn't say we're going to make Sony known for quality. He said we're going to make Japan known for quality. This is the punchline. He chose a mission for Sony that was bigger than Sony. And when we talk about Earth's most customer centric company, we have a similar idea in mind. We want other companies to look at Amazon and see us as a standard bearer for obsessive focus on the customer as opposed to obsessive focus on the competitor. I love how all this stuff ties together. So let's go back to this. ([Time 0:17:07](https://share.snipd.com/snip/94d29e40-1577-4a75-91f2-763969c1a28b))
    - **Note:** Jeff wanted to have a mission greater than the company and he took this idea from Sony who wanted to make Japan not Sony known for quality. Jeff likewise wanted to create the best e-commerce most customer centric platform. Sees this as day one for the internet and the internet only supports aggregators and the long tail not the middle. Jeff knew this task was going to be extremely hard not easy. Building the Amazon fly wheel improving one area catalyses a change in another area and then you have the entire company rolling down hill. Find the key levers to get the flywheel going.
- Amazon's Flywheel and Jeff Bezos' Management Philosophy
  Summary:
  Jeff Bezos' management philosophy is centered around the concept of the Amazon flywheel, which involves continuously improving customer experience and driving productivity, margin, efficiency, and asset velocity.
  Bezos believes that the best way to enhance one aspect is by improving the others, creating a cycle where more efficient distribution leads to faster delivery times, reduced costs, improved customer experience, strengthened brand, and ultimately decreased customer acquisition and retention costs.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  No one left myself. He sees how everything connects and feeds into his overall plan for Amazon. There's this very famous thing you should, very famous image. If you Google image search Amazon flywheel, I think the visual gives a basic idea. This is not the exact same thing and his flywheel has evolved over time. But you can see that's how he thinks naturally because it's a very early days of the company is talking about this. So he talks about the importance of very high standards. He talks about over and over again. To us, operational excellence implies two things, delivering continuous improvement in customer experience and driving productivity, margin, efficiency and asset velocity Across all of our businesses. Often now this is where it all connects. This is very interesting. Often the best way to drive one of these, right? He just said, hey, we're going to constantly continue to improve in customer experience, right? We're going to drive productivity, increase margin, efficiency and asset velocity across all of our businesses. Then this is where how he connects all of us together for you and I. Often the very best way to drive one of these is to deliver the other. For instance, more efficient distribution yields faster delivery times, which in turns lowers contacts per order and customer service costs. These in turn, improve customer experience and build brand, which in turn decreases customer acquisition and retention costs. That is one of the most important paragraphs I feel in all of the shareholder letters. Again, you can read ([Time 0:20:10](https://share.snipd.com/snip/645a04ac-c7f1-4089-9c92-aba8ce23808a))
    - **Note:** Amazon flywheel being unapologetically extreme.
- Jeff Bezos Focuses on Internal Metrics Amidst Stock Drop
  Summary:
  Jeff Bezos remained focused on internal metrics of his business while others were fixated on the stock drop.
  Despite the stock plummeting by 80 percent, Bezos acknowledged that the internal metrics of the company were improving, indicating a stronger position than ever before. Bezos emphasized making bold investment decisions while being prepared for failures, citing instances of losses in startup investments such as living.com and pets.com.
  This approach reflects Bezos' strategy of taking risks, learning from failures, and continuing to innovate for the long-term success of Amazon and its ventures.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  All we should be focusing on rather is what we can actually control inside the actual business. So I wrote, everyone else was focused on the stock. Jeff was focused on the internal metrics of his business. He's like, this is a bizarre experience because yeah, the stock dropped by 80 percent, but the actual internal metrics of the company are improving. So it says, ouch, it's been a brutal year for many in the capital markets and certainly for Amazon shareholders. As of this writing, the shares are down more than 80 percent from when I wrote you last year. Nevertheless, by almost any measure, Amazon, the company is in a stronger position than at any time in the past. And he does something smart here where he starts out with all the mistakes. He's like, listen, I say we're going to be bold. We're going to make bold investment decisions. We're not going to make timid investment decisions, but bold bets can and will fail sometimes. That's completely expected. So they wind up losing a bunch of money on these other dot com startups. Many of you have heard me talk about the bold bets that we as a company have made and will continue to make our decision to invest in smaller e-commerce companies, including living dot Com and pets dot com, both of which shut down operations in 2000. We lost a significant amount of money on both, but we're going to see Jeff is learning and I'm going to tie this into another. He gave a TED talk on the Internet's electricity metaphor. I took notes on it many, many years ago. I'll include it. The link down below, but check this out. He realized like, oh, this isn't the gold rush. That's a ([Time 0:23:19](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ea971546-e319-4571-a9a5-89410d43930d))
    - **Note:** Jeff after the stock fell 80% still saw the fundamentals of the business improving. Divorce yourself from the stock price and focus on what you can control. Jeff was able to evolve his thinking and admit mistakes he saw the internet as a gold rush but then realized it was more like the invention of electricity creating network effects as it grew. Jeff remained convicted on the future of the internet as a technology and realized these technology shifts took time, but he became non consensus and right. The scale of the internet means the big companies can get to scale and have network effects. He was relentless.
- Jim Cinegal's Influence on Jeff Bezos' Pricing Strategy
  Summary:
  Jim Cinegal's mentoring of Jeff Bezos led to Bezos adopting Costco's strategy of offering low prices to drive sales volume, negotiate better deals with suppliers, and increase per unit gross profit.
  Bezos, inspired by Cinegal, transformed Amazon's pricing strategy to emphasize everyday low prices to compete with Walmart and Costco. This shift in pricing strategy, influenced by Cinegal, allowed Amazon to focus on a wider selection, convenience for customers, and drive competitiveness through lower prices, exemplified by a 20 to 30% price cut on books, music, and videos after Bezos' meeting with Cinegal.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Else. And then Jim also realized how it all connects. Costco's low prices generated heavy sales volume in the company then used its significant size to demand the best possible deals from suppliers. Thus raising its per unit gross profit dollars. And you have to ask Jim, why are you educating a potential competitor? And Jim says, because I've been it fitted from people that came before me that gave me their ideas a decade later in filing preparing to retire Cinegal remembers a conversation. Well, I think Jeff looked at it and thought that was something that he could apply to his business as well. He does not regret educating an entrepreneur who would evolve into a ferocious competitor. This is what Jim said. I've always had the opinion that we have shamelessly stolen any good ideas. And then this is the result. Bezos took the lessons he learned during that coffee in 2001 and applied them with a vengeance the Monday after the meeting with Cinegal. Bezos opened an S team that says executive team meeting by saying he was determined to make a change. The company's pricing strategy he said according to several executives over there was incoherent. Amazon preached low prices, but in some cases the prices were higher than competitors. Like Walmart and Costco Bezos said Amazon should have everyday low prices. This is why if Amazon could stay competitive on price, it would win the day on on limit selection and on the convenience afforded to customers who didn't have to get in the car to go to a Store and wait in line. That July as a result of the cynical meeting, Amazon announced it was cutting prices of books, music and videos by 20 to 30%. And this is when they started identifying the flywheel. They started identifying the loop that has been mentioned a few times in the shareholder's so ([Time 0:32:08](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fd6b2ad8-3cdc-417b-a703-76584a3c27c3))
    - **Note:** Jeff’s meeting with Jim sinegal changed the trajectory of the business becoming more ruthlessly focused on costs. Important to learn from those who came before you as they lay the groundwork. This meeting was worth billions but cost Jeff one meeting. There are billion dollar ideas in $30 history books.
- The Importance of Long Term Customer Experience Design
  Summary:
  Customer experience design should prioritize the long-term benefit of the customer over short-term profits.
  Empowering customers to review products may lead to short-term sales loss but ultimately helps them make better purchasing decisions, benefiting the company in the long run. Aligning customer and shareholder interests by focusing on customer care leads to rewards over time.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  It's all about long-term thinking and it really is talking about, hey, you need to design your customer experience with their long-term benefit. The long-term benefit of the customer in mind, not the money that you'll make in the short term. And he's saying this is counterintuitive and rare and he gives a perfect example to illustrate why it's so difficult to do that. Because we design our customer experience, we do so with long-term owners in mind. We empower customers to review products. So the reviews, obviously everybody knows this now, this was a reference to the new, it's time you could do a review. You're going to Amazon to buy something and the sales page could be a bad review or a bunch of bad reviews so you don't buy them. So he says, we receive complaints from a few vendors basically wondering if we understood what business we're in. You make money when you sell things. Why would you allow negative reviews on your website? Thinking as a focus group of one, I know I've sometimes changed my mind before making purchases on Amazon as a result of negative or lukewarm customer reviews. Though, and this is so important because it goes against, I think, human nature. Though negative reviews cost us some sales in the short term. Helping customers make better purchases, decisions ultimately pays off for the company. And that it's so important because he feels there is no misalignment between customer and shareholder interest. Thank you. Always taking care of the customer than the shareholders we rewarded over the long term. He quotes Ben Graham a bunch in his book as well, or not the book in the shareholder letters. On that time scale, the interest of shareholders and customers ([Time 0:38:39](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8654f63e-2e88-4e8e-936d-2cb812cbf220))
    - **Note:** Jeff saw no difference between customers and investors over the long term as that’s why he allowed negative reviews. It didn’t make the immediate sales but it built good will for all future sales. Focused on every day low prices and convienence. Unapologetically extreme and high standards after getting the highest Ed customer satisfaction every he just wants to improve.
- The Importance of Customer Care and Shareholder Interest According to Jeff Bezos
  Summary:
  Jeff Bezos emphasizes the importance of customer care and shareholder interest alignment, believing that prioritizing customer satisfaction over shareholder demands leads to long-term rewards.
  Amazon's record-breaking customer satisfaction score of 88 from the American Customer Satisfaction Index showcases their commitment to exceeding customer expectations. Bezos sets unapologetically high standards for Amazon, always striving for improvement despite already being the best.
  He highlights the significance of good judgment and intuitive decision-making over relying solely on data, emphasizing the need for constant innovation and improvement.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And that it's so important because he feels there is no misalignment between customer and shareholder interest. Thank you. Always taking care of the customer than the shareholders we rewarded over the long term. He quotes Ben Graham a bunch in his book as well, or not the book in the shareholder letters. On that time scale, the interest of shareholders and customers are aligned. If you do this over a long period of time, right? This year, the widely followed American customer satisfaction index gave Amazon a score of 88, which is the highest customer satisfaction score ever recorded in any service industry. A representative of the American customer satisfaction index was quoted as saying, if they go any higher, they will get a nosebleed. And then Jeff says, we are working on that again. Unapologetically extreme. He's got ridiculously high standards. He is already the best Amazon already got the highest score out of any company on this index ever. And he's like, okay, I still want to be better. Okay. So then he's got a shareholder letter. This is this part is incredible. It's all about making decisions. And really on the need for good judgment and why data may actually lead you to make the wrong decision. And this is also why he talks about the importance of wandering. He says like the best decisions he's ever made in his life were not math driven. They were like intuitive taste or like gut based decisions. He starts out, I'm going to skip over the ([Time 0:39:47](https://share.snipd.com/snip/17af6f9f-6141-48da-8a6b-50d542fe5f61))
    - **Note:** Importance of blending intuition and data. The best decisions Jeff made were by wandering and figuring things out. Sometimes you don’t have all the data and you need to make a call with 70% or less or else you would’ve moved too slow. In their lowering prices the data was always worse next quarter but you can’t project that effect over 5 years so you need to exercise judgement
- The Best Way to Create Shareholder Value: Starting with the Customer
  Summary:
  Creating shareholder value is best achieved by focusing on customer differentiation.
  By prioritizing differentiation in the customer experience, one can avoid building undifferentiated commodity businesses, which are not profitable in the long run. Jeff Bezos emphasizes the importance of differentiation for survival in the market, as outlined in his shareholder letters.
  This approach guides decisions on expanding business ventures, such as opening physical stores, by ensuring a meaningful and unique customer experience that sets the business apart in the retail landscape.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  In our judgment, there's that word again, in our judgment, that is the best way to create shareholder value. The next shareholder is goes into his thinking about, hey, like, how do you decide when to like build new business? Like, how do you decide what to go into? And really, you could think about he's going to give us, he's asked the question, hey, how do you decide when you actually go into open physical stores? Right? This is in 2006. And this goes back to I would summarize this. He's like, I have no interest in building an undifferentiated commodity business, which you and I just discussed in length because I just read Peter Thiel's book. The main theme is zero to one is the fact that undifferentiated commodity businesses still make any money. And he explicitly says in that book, don't build one. That's episode 278. If you haven't listened to it yet, I often get asked when are you going to go open physical stores? The essential size of a network of physical stores is exciting, right? Physical world retailing is a cagey and ancient business that is already well served. And we don't have any ideas for how to build a physical world store experience that's meaningfully differentiated for customers. Differentiation is something that Bezos is obsessed with. One of the most interesting themes in his last shareholder letter is the fact that he feels differentiation is survival. And it's something you have to put a constant amount of energy into because the universe wants you ([Time 0:43:10](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1e076f33-edd3-4533-bf25-c5718295a47c))
    - **Note:** Jeff saw differentiation as survival and did t want to build physical stores because he didn’t believe he had any edge. Was willing to incubate many small differentiated businesses in Amazon. Didn’t need to be large day 1 just different and allowed to grow. He wanted a team of missionaries vs mercenaries.
- The Benefits of Long-Term Thinking and Customer Focus in Business
  Summary:
  Long-term thinking in business enables leveraging existing abilities, exploring new possibilities, supporting failure for invention, and pioneering in unexplored spaces.
  It aligns well with customer obsession, allowing patient development of solutions over multiple years. Working backward from customer needs enhances business skills over time as it prompts learning and adaptation, contrasting with a skills-forward approach used by many businesses.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  We will stay heads down, focus on the long term and obsessed over customers. Long term thinking levers our existing abilities and lets us do new things we couldn't otherwise contemplate. It supports the failure in iteration required for invention and it frees us to pioneer in unexplored spaces. Seek instant gratification or the elusive promise of it and chances are you will find a crowd there ahead of you. Long term or this is excellent. Long term orientation interacts well with customer obsession. If we can identify a customer need and if we can further develop conviction that the need is meaningful and durable, our approach permits us to work patiently for multiple years to avoid Or multiple years to deliver a solution. Working backward from customer needs can be contrasted with a skills forward approach where existing skills and competencies are used to drive business opportunities. So I'm going to pause right there. Why is the note saying, hey, if you work backwards from the customer needs, this is actually going to force you. It will make you a more skilled business operator over time because he's like, well, if we have to work back, we start with what's best for the customer, we might not have those skills To build the thing. That's irrelevant. We will go out and learn them. And he's saying most businesses say they use what he's calling a skills forward approach. Meaning this is skills ([Time 0:50:23](https://share.snipd.com/snip/176e17c7-7dce-4169-8b2f-a0d4b63307bf))
    - **Note:** Uses customer forward not skills forward. First figures out what the customer needs then learns how to build it doesn’t figure out use their skills to make something for customers. Working backwards helps you grow as well and challenge yourself. He’s excited when he hears bad things about the business because problems are opportunities in work clothes. Kaizen constant change for the better Japanese term.
- Amazon's CEO on the importance of long-term thinking and power of invention
  Summary:
  The financial results reflect 15 years of customer experience improvements.
  Long-term thinking is crucial as it prompts questions about the business's sustainability. Amazon focuses on invention to build new and innovative businesses, with Amazon Web Services being a prime example of this approach.
  The value of Amazon Web Services is significant and undeniable.
  The CEO emphasizes the importance of providing undeniable value to customers.
  He highlights that inventions empowering others to pursue their dreams are the most transformative. Amazon's success is attributed to being internally driven and committed to continuous innovation.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Financial results for 2009 reflect the cumulative efforts of 15 years of customer experience improvements. That's the end of Jeff's sentence. This is the beginning of Peter's. If you focus on near term growth above all else, you miss the most important question you should be asking. Will this business still be around a decade from skipping ahead by year two? He's talking about the fact that Amazon, it will be a place of invention. We will build new businesses, innovative businesses that no one else has done before. He calls it the power of invention. Really, I just, when I, there's only a few sentences I pulled off from this entire year. One of it, he talks about, he starts talking about AWS, Amazon Web Services, which is now this gigantic, who knows how much the business would be worth if it was actually outside of Amazon. It's very valuable. I think in the last, I think in the last year, whole area talks about the growth of AWS specifically. I think it was like something, I forgot how fast it grew, but now it's up to like $50 billion a year, whatever it was, when he wrote that letter, this is the main point. The value of Amazon Web Services is undeniable, meaning from the customer's perspective, the value is undeniable. I think about this in my terms. Myself is a good question to ask yourself, is the value my product provides undeniable? Then he's just got a fantastic quote. He's talking about all these other businesses that they're inventing on behalf of the customer. I love this. The most radical and transformative of inventions are often those that empower others, and I italicize that, others, to unleash their italicize that too, creativity to produce their Dreams. I'm going to read that without me interrupting. The most radical and transformative of inventions are often those that empower others to unleash their creativity to pursue their dreams. Moving ahead, he's got a entire shareholder dedicated to the importance of being internally driven. Now, this section was fantastic. ([Time 0:54:22](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8253284c-cd40-4605-9e18-fbb203a810d9))
    - **Note:** Create products that have undeniable value to others and empower users to create and achieve their dreams. Had an internal locus of control/scorecard. Do things before they have to and innovate before it’s being asked because that’s what customers want. Being proactive delights and earns trust.
- Jeff Bezos on Customer Service and Characteristics of Dreamy Businesses
  Key takeaways:
  - Customers first approach can lead to proactively providing refunds
  - Dreamy business offerings have four key characteristics: Customers love it, it can grow to a very large size, it has strong returns on capital and it's durable in time with the potential to endure for decades
  - Experimentation is necessary to find big winners, as they can pay for many failed attempts
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Amazon noticed that I experienced poor video playback and they decided to give me a refund because of that. Wow, talk about putting customers first. And this is his main point. Doing it proactively is more expensive for us, but it also surprises the lights and earns trust. And a few years later, at the beginning of the 2014 shareholder letter, he gives the characteristics that he looks for in businesses that he wants to keep forever. A dreamy business offering has at least four characteristics. Customers love it. It can grow to a very large size. It has strong returns on capital and it's durable in time with the potential to endure for decades. When you find one of these, get married. We are now happily wed to what I believe are three such life partners, Marketplace, Prime and AWS. And so those are just three more big winners. But a lot of that is like you have to do a lot of experimentation. And the reason you do that is because the big winners pay for many experiments. It does not matter if it took them 100 failed experiments to get these three giant businesses. So he talks a lot about why you have to be bold in the world of business. And I just wrote right above this section. This is so important to remember. Outsize returns often come from betting against conventional wisdom and conventional wisdom is usually right. Given a 10% chance of a 100 times payoff, you should take that bet every time. But you're still going to be wrong nine times out of 10. We all know that if you swing for the fences, you're going to strike out a lot. But you're also going to hit some home runs. The difference between baseball and business, however, is that baseball has a truncated outcome distribution. When you swing, no matter how well you connect with the ball, the most returns you can get is four. In business every once in a while, when you step up to the plate, you can score 1000 runs. This long tail distribution of returns is why it's important to be bold. Big winners pay for so many experiments. So then he dedicates one of his shareholder letters, one year of shareholders letters to this idea of fending off day two. And so it says, Jeff, what does day two look like? ([Time 0:57:39](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e9a766c2-ccbd-4adf-b18d-bb33c366490b))
    - **Note:** Outsized returns come from betting against conventional wisdom which is usually right a 100x payoff with 10% likelihood often loses but is a great bet. Aim to hit home runs in business. Because of asymmetric upside in business big winners pay for many losers. Day 2 is death you need to be Hungru and live in day 1.
- Amazon's proactive customer focus strategy
  Key takeaways:
  - Proactive measures have long-term benefits such as building trust
  - Warren Buffett looks for certain characteristics in businesses, including durability and strong returns on capital
  - Marketplace, Prime and AWS are considered life partners by Buffett, with potential for long-term success.

  Doing it proactively is more expensive for us, but it also surprises the lights and earns trust. And a few years later, at the beginning of the 2014 shareholder letter, he gives the characteristics that he looks for in businesses that he wants to keep forever. A dreamy business offering has at least four characteristics. Customers love it. It can grow to a very large size. It has strong returns on capital and it's durable in time with the potential to endure for decades. When you find one of these, get married. We are now happily wed to what I believe are three such life partners, Marketplace, Prime and AWS. And so those are just three more big winners.

- Fending off Day Two: Jeff Bezos' Philosophy
  Key takeaways:
  - Jeff Bezos dedicated one year of shareholder letters to the idea of fending off day two
  - Day two is stasis, followed by relevance, painful decline, and then death
  - An established company might harvest day two for decades, but it will still come
  - The question of how to fend off day two cannot have a simple answer

  Big winners pay for so many experiments. So then he dedicates one of his shareholder letters, one year of shareholders letters to this idea of fending off day two. And so it says, Jeff, what does day two look like? That's the question I got at our most recent all hands meeting. I've been reminding people that it's day one for a couple of decades. I work in an Amazon building named day one. And when I move buildings, I took the name with me. I spend time thinking about this topic. And this is his answer. Day two is stasis, followed by relevance, followed by excruciating painful decline, followed by death. And that is why it's always day one. And so he goes into more detail about this. To be sure, this kind of decline would happen in an extreme slow motion. An established company might harvest day two for decades, but the final result would still come. I'm interested in the question, how do you fend off day two? What are the techniques and tactics? How do you keep the vitality of day one, even inside a large organization? Such a question cannot have a simple answer. So he's going to give us a few ideas. He's got four different ideas here. I cannot have a simple answer. There will be many elements, multiple paths and many traps. I don't know the whole answer, but I know bits of it. Here's a starter pack of essentials for day one defense. And he puts this into four categories. Customer obsession, a skeptical view of proxies, the eager adoption of external trends, and high velocity decision making. So the first one, true customer obsession, you and I have talked about it a bunch today. I have to go into more detail. This one was interesting. Resist proxies. As companies get larger and more complex, there's a tendency to manage to proxies. This comes in many shapes and sizes, and it's dangerous and subtle. A common example is process as proxy. Good process serves you so you can serve customers. But if you're not watchful, the process becomes the thing. The process becomes the proxy for the result you want. It's not that rare, he's talking about in large organizations. It's not that rare to hear a junior leader defend a bad outcome with something like, well, we've followed the process. A more experienced leader will use as an opportunity to investigate and improve the process. ([Time 0:59:37](https://share.snipd.com/snip/eb3e043b-1ced-4dc7-8384-536d9b7efab2))
    - **Note:** Fend off day 2. Embrace external trends have processes but don’t hold to them as holy change when they don’t work don’t follow blindly. Need to make high quality and high velocity decisions. One way vs 2 way door decisions know which is which. Better to course correct and make ok decisions than wait to long to be perfect and have the market pass you. Jeff sets high standards as standards are contagious and people rise or fall to them. High standards need to be across sectors you need to set high standards in all sectors. Unreasonably high standard. Don’t have unrealistic standards on scope. Most people think the scope is smaller and expect quicker mastery this leads to more quitting when you needed to put in more work even the experts had put in more work. You need to understand the holistic scope of the problem before you proceed or you will trick yourself into difficulty and quit too early.
- Amazon's Culture of Writing Six-Page Narratives
  Summary:
  The key insight is that Amazon's high standards are maintained through the practice of writing six-page narratives instead of using PowerPoint.
  Taking the time to prepare these documents is crucial to ensure that the scope is realistic and the quality is high. The realization is that the quality of the memos varies due to wrong expectations on scope, as some believe a high standard memo can be written quickly when it actually requires a week or more.
  The emphasis is on the importance of dedicating sufficient time to writing and rewriting great memos, sharing them for improvement, and allowing time for fresh edits.
  The overarching lesson is that by teaching the appropriate scope of work, results can be significantly improved.

  Unrealistic beliefs on scope are often hidden and undiscussed will kill high standards. And so he applies this in his business. He says, listen, Amazon culture is famous for having these six page narratives. They will not do PowerPoint. Instead, before a meeting, you have to write out like what the ideas or what you're thinking should put an unbelievable, you should put way more time than you think you should in these, Preparing these documents because you're taking up so much time and having a meeting in the first place, right? So he says, we don't do PowerPoint at Amazon. We write narratively structured six page memos. We silently read one at the beginning of each meeting in a kind of study hall. And so he talks about the quality of these memos varies widely. And so they realize like, what is the main, like, why are we finding, like, if there is a bad memo, what is the likely cause? And he realized it's, it says when a memo isn't great, it's not the writer's inability to recognize the high standard, but instead a wrong expectation on scope. This is very fascinating. They mistakenly believe a high standard six page memo can be written in one or two days or even a few hours when really it might take a week or more. They're trying to perfect a handstand in just two weeks. And we're not coaching them right. The great memos are written and rewritten. Share with colleagues who are asked to improve the work, set aside for a couple of days, and then edit it again with a fresh mind. They simply cannot be done in a day or two. The key point here is that you can improve results through the simple act of teaching scope that a great memo probably should take a week or more. So then Jeff starts writing about his idea of the importance of wandering. He not only writes about his shareholder letters, but he also talks about it in public speeches. ([Time 1:06:03](https://share.snipd.com/snip/43f4dcaf-79dc-49a5-8a58-93a06aa0c877))
    - **Note:** Jeff the importance of taking time to write well. Great writing doesn’t happen in a couple days. Good memos take weeks.
- The Importance of Wandering and Scaling Failure in Business
  Summary:
  Wandering in business is guided by intuition and curiosity, leading to valuable discoveries.
  It balances efficiency and is crucial for nonlinear breakthroughs. Examples like AWS show the success of wandering in innovation.
  Scaling failure is necessary for business growth.
  Failures should increase in size with business expansion to drive significant innovation.
  Large-scale risk-taking is essential for companies to provide groundbreaking solutions, even if it involves multi-billion dollar failures. Successful bets can offset the costs of failed experiments, demonstrating the importance of scaling failures in business development.

  So this is what I was referencing earlier where he says multiple times that the best, like all their best ideas, the most opportunities came from wandering. In contrast, wandering in business is not efficient, but it's also not random. It's guided by hunch, gut, intuition, curiosity, and powered by a deep conviction that the prize for customers is big enough that it's worth being a little messy and tangential to find Our way there. Wandering is an essential counterbalance to efficiency. You need to employ both. The outside discoveries, the nonlinear ones are highly likely to require wandering. And so he gives us this example, AWS as a whole is an example. No one asked for AWS. No one. Not the world was in fact ready and hungry for an offering like AWS, but didn't know it. We had a hunch, followed our curiosity, took the necessary financial risks, and began building, reworking, experimenting, and iterating countless times as we proceeded. And so he combines this idea of the importance of wandering with another idea that's related to it, that your failures need to scale to as your business skills. So he's going to use the example of Echo for this. As the company grows, everything needs to scale, including the size of your failed experiments. If the size of your failures isn't growing, you're not going to be inventing at a size that can actually move the needle. And so his point is like Amazon side, Amazon size, we're going to have to occasionally have multi-billion dollar failures. So this kind of large scale risk taking is part of the service we as a large company can provide to our customers and to society. The good news for shareholders is that a single big winning bet can more than cover the cost of many losers. And so he talks about how disastrous the fire phone was. They lost a bunch of money, but it also led them in part to developing ([Time 1:08:01](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0f6e97a5-10c1-4e70-a3c4-7bbc718ae55a))
    - **Note:** You need to keep wandering and as you grow your failures should grow. If you’re not failing big your not ambitious enough.
- Do You Have a Fire Phone?
  Key takeaways:
  - Differentiation is survival
  - The universe wants you to be typical
  - The world pulls at you to be normal
  - Maintaining distinctiveness takes energy
  - Don't let the world make you typical
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And finally we reached his last shareholder letter. I just want to pull out one piece of advice that Jeff has for you and I that I thought was absolutely excellent. Differentiation is survival and the universe wants you to be typical. In what ways does the world pull at you in an attempt to make you normal? How much work does it take to maintain your distinctiveness? To keep alive the thing or the things that make you special? We all know that distinctiveness, originality, is valuable. What I'm asking you to do is embrace how much energy it takes to maintain that distinctiveness. The world wants you to be typical. In a thousand ways it pulls at you. Don't let that happen. ([Time 1:10:43](https://share.snipd.com/snip/85d31f6c-2029-4a6e-9f63-852fb4bcc68d))

    - **Note:** Don’t be typical be yourself. Differentiation is survival. The world wants to put you in a box and simplify you but don’t let it use agency to be yourself. Put in the energy to maintain your differentiation. It’s hard to be yourself but that’s where the rewards are. Go levered long on your unique differentiation.
      Differentiation is survival the world wants to make you typical don’t let it.
