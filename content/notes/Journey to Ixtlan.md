### Highlights

- A warrior doesn’t waste time. Everything he does it strategic. In the doing of strategy there is no victory or defeat only action. When you don’t have any control you give up power. There is a cubic centimeter of chance that pops up in our lives from time to time and the warrior needs to be alert to the opportunity and grab it. Usually we’re too tight to grab our cubic cm of luck. We need to be loose as possible to have a chance at grabbing this. Raj’s opportunities and be prepared to take. You need to be alert about things you know and don’t know. Our desire to seek explanations of disease.￼ We look for an explanation to overcome everything. We can get to a place where explanation doesn’t matter. Carlos realizes he’s no more important than a beetle and that death is coming for both of them and this gives him a deeper respect of the world. Sees the integration of it all. This guy has a full conversation with a coyote. Carlos fully stopped the world. People tell us that the world is such and such and we are so and so and we believe them. We are forced to see the world the the way other people tell us it is not the way sorcerer see it. We need to see the magic of the world. Seeing requires you to inhabit the middle ground between sorcerers and normal people. The real thing is when the body realizes it can see and we realize the world we see everyday is just a description of reality. There is never a final step in our journey to ixtlan. We’re always on the journey. The art of a warrior is to balance the terror of being a man with the wonder of being a man. If it’s not your time you must walk away from your appointment you must be crystal clear and deadly sure of yourself

    - **Note:** Don’t waste time act purposefully in your life and opportunities are small when they come up and you must take them. Cubic centimeter of luck in the half spaces. We feel like we need explanations, but many things defy explanation and we must be OK with that. Carlos starts to deeply understand the world and sees it not the way other people tell him, but with the magic of it. People try to tell us what the world is, but we need to understand the world in the magic of the half spaces. What we see is just a representation of the entire world and we need to balance fear and delight constantly. Life is a constant journey and sometimes it’s our time and sometimes it’s not.
- We either make ourselves miserable or strong but the amount of work is the same so choose strength. Doing is what makes everything what it is but there is a power in not doing. You can look at a rock but to truly see the rock you must engage in not doing. Doing makes you see a pebble as a small rock but not doing allows you to see it as part of the universe connected to a boulder. An average man changes his perspective on things depending on if they’re true or false. a warrior acts on what is true by doing and doesn’t act on what is not true by not doing. Carlos does and exercise where he is pushing and pulling feelings in and out of his body. He feels cold when he should feel warm. The world is made of lines and not doing is feeling and manipulating these lines. Not doing is simple but not easy and can only happen when you stop the world. We observe not doing by observing shadows. Not doing is reading in between the lies of the universe. By reducing the world we enlarge it. You completely become mystified by the magic of the half spaces of life. Don’t scorn the mysteries of the world just because you know how to scorn. Carlos has told himself he was rotten. Don Juan tells him to say the opposite invert his internal dialogue knowing he is lying to recognize the absurdity of both positions which opens his mind of not doing. Both aren’t real the only thing that is real is the being in ourselves that will die. To arrive at that being is the non doing of ourselves. Everything is a disguise when we are doing. It’s easy to fool people who are doing when you’re not doing. Carlos feels having a foot in 2 worlds makes him useless in either he’s neither warrior nor professor not committed in life. Don Juan disagrees Warriors turn their worlds into their hunting grounds. Everything is meant to be used. Warrior knows the world is meant to be used and has no issues taking what is his except the warrior doesn’t mind when he’s used and taken himself.

    - **Note:** Life is hard enough choose the easiest path and choose not doing. See the entire system and gain the wider perspective. We can see a pebble or a small piece of a boulder. A man changes his mind sees the entire system and the world. Push and pull feelings out of body. He is unaligned. The world is made of connected lines and success is living in between and manipulating the lines. Not doing requires a lot of patienence and is simple not easy you read between the lines of the universe. Reducing the world makes it bigger you see the magic of it. Embrace the magic of the world. Expose your internal dialogue to see the absurdity of it make the invisible visible and you realize how absurd it all is. Everything we do is a mask we wear. The masks arent real the only reality is the life in ourself. You cannot be in 2 worlds you must commit to who you are and become alligned. A warrior uses his entire life to serve him.
- Power both commands and obeys you. It’s controlled chaos. Must be handled consciously and forcefully. Store power in your body. We can’t be careless with power. In order to have power one must live with power. Carlos has crazy hallucinations in his fight with power and he can’t tell if the food he’s eating a spite or if he’s really dealing with transcendent power making a macro weird ways. Act of a warrior is stopping the world for specific reason and then restarting it when you’ve accomplished your goal. We need to believe that personal power can be used in stored, but that’s not easy for anyone. Personal Power isn’t personal or unique to a person. To only talk about power is useless to understand power you must stress and use it. Power accumulates in your body when you plug up the drains it flows out of. We must test ourselves against power. Storing power requires the body to not do. To be quiet. When you stare at a tree you want to stare at the leaves but you must stare at the spaces in between the leaves. Staring at nothing is how you trap power.
- Carlos feels like a leaf in the wind, just being pulled by the universe every which direction with no control. Since he was born, people were doing things against his will pulling him in all these directions, and that made him feel helpless and lost. He never carved his own direction so he didn’t know where to go. No matter how much do you like to feel sorry for yourself. You have to change it because you can’t be a warrior that way. There’s no use to complain and be sad like someone is always doing something to us. No one is doing anything to anyone. We assume for responsibility we’re not at the mercy of anything. A warrior burys himself to find power. Self pity doesn’t jive with power the mood of a warrior requires control over himself and abandoning himself. Control your dreams through lucid dreaming. Look up techniques for lucid dreaming. A warrior makes his own limits and mood and spurs his own fear. Act in the mood that works for you. We must have the mood of a warrior there is no power in a life that lacks this mood. Don’t be a lead in the wind be controlled and calculated. Then he acts when he needs to and let’s go of the situation when it’s over doesn’t carry it with him. No one can push a warrior or make him do things he doesn’t want to a warrior is doomed to survive in the best possible circumstances. A warrior could be injured but not offended. Carlos isn’t offended when a lion chases him but is when a person says something because he thinks it’s more intentional from humans while it’s natural from lions. I reject this because humans may have consciousness but are ay the mercy of their nature as much as the lion. To see lions rats and men as equals is an act of the warrior spirit it takes power to do that.

    - **Note:** Don’t live in the model of others construct your own model of the world. You have agency over your life if you’re not at the mercy of anything or anyone. Don’t complain or pity just create your own path. Don’t impose limits on yourself. Be intentional in life. Don’t be mad when a person is a dick. They’re only acting in their nature. It’s like being mad at the sun for coming up. They can’t control who they are maybe they can change but ultimately it’s useless to get mad about external peoples actions as much as it is to get mad at weather. We’re doomed to survive don’t be offended.
- Be accessible to power a warrior is a hunter who thinks his dreams of power are reality. Dreams is immaculate Hunter who hunts power without being drunk or crazy. He doesn’t have time for those distractions dreams are a reality to him. Doesn’t have the time of the disposition to bluff or make a wrong move. Stakes are too high for that. Dreaming is real because he can act deliberately and dreams. Make yourself accessible to power in this awesome mysterious world. Power or something a warrior deals with At first it is far fetched and tough to deal with then it becomes a serious matter one might not know it exists, but then something is there. Power is manifested as something uncontrollable. It comes to oneself. It is nothing yet it makes marvels. Powers within ourselves, controlling our acts and obeying our demands. Becoming available to power puts you at a great risk. Don Juan saw a branch flowing in the wind but it actually looked like a powerful animal dying. The wind had granted life to this branch giving it immense power. Being able to see that branch for a powerful animal is what dealing with power is like not running from it or thinking it’s just a branch. Nothing is just a branch. Stop the world when he felt fear awe power and death all in one he should’ve stoped the world and sat in that feeling. Carlos said that he didn’t deserve power and he was weak Don Juan‘s world was strong and fair. Don Juan said he was a man and he deserves everything that a man deserves joy, sadness, pain, and struggle. The nature of ones acts didn’t matter if they acted as a warrior. Purge your spirit if it’s not pure make it perfect there’s no reason to accept an imperfect spirit or life, not doing this is seeking death which is the same as doing nothing because death is coming for us regardless. Carlos said that he was Callista pain and sadness because of his roaming were so long and would only realize this in rare times where he would become intensely lonely and helpless.

    - **Note:** Become accessible to power. Power is within yourself and controls us. Power cannot be handled lightly and transforms the world. Sit in power. Becoming available to it is a great risk with a great reward. When you become accessible to power the halfspaces come to life. A branch looks like an animal. The world is more awesome and nothing is quite as it seems. Stop the world and sit in it. Act like a warrior you must have a pure spirit death is coming for us all. Do everything as a warrior the acts dont matter just the type. Perception shapes reality but when we look through power our perception is greatly altered. The ideas of power and presence in the native religions are amazing and really transcendent ways to view the world.
- Hunter is successful not because he knows the routines of his prey, but because he has no routines himself and cannot be hunted or expected. He’s free fluid and unpredictable. A life with no routines. Disrupt the routines of your life don’t be easy to predict. We behave like pray, which makes us pray to someone else. Pray either fights or runs, but a hunter finds the leverage points find his way out and prepares. Positions and waits. We must assume responsibility for being in a weird world. For for Carlos, the world is weird because if it doesn’t make sense, he’s odds with it and for Don Juan the world is weird because it’s so amazing and complex and magnificent and the time is so short that he wants to explore everything but can’t in the finite time. Assume responsibility for being in this marvelous world with the marvelous time. Take responsibility for being in this world. Make every act count. We don’t think we can do any better and that we have plenty of time but we can do much better and we have no time. We have no time this could be it. Don’t just agree, but take the act and change. We need to act like everything we’re doing is our last act. We don’t have time. We don’t have continuity for bullshit. We just got a fucking live. Don’t be timid we’re fighting our last battle act with power. Make every act like it’s your last actor on earth don’t be timid. Don’t have enough time to be timid. Asses every act like it’s his last live in the struggle be aware of your death.

    - **Note:** A Hunter has no routines and cannot be tracked. He lives a fluid life. We pray, lives a stagnating life. Find the leverage and take responsibility for the world in your place in it time is precious and we have very little of it so we need to make the most of it and live it up constantly. The world is a weird complex, beauty. Don’t just agree get action.
- In order to be a hunter, you need to be in perfect balance with the world and see it in different ways. The best hunters don’t necessarily like hunt they’re just good at it. There are good and bad spots in the universe that make us feel better or worse for inhabiting them. A hunter is a tight individual leaving very little to chance. If you don’t have a clear picture of what you want you may be more humble and willing to learn. Don Juan used to wallow in his sorrows for being born in Indian in a country that treated them like dogs, but then realize there’s no benefit to this and stopped. The way he lived wasn’t worth living so he changed it. Carlos not fighting our own battles but the battles of other unknown people for some unknown reason. Carlos doesn’t wanna learn about plants. He wants to be a pimp for information to get status or credit. Don Juan’s world of precise acts was infinitely better than Carlos’s life. Balance being available and unavailable. When you’re obviously hiding you’re not unavailable it’s clear you’re hiding so being available likewise is about finding people who give you energy. Being unavailable means you only take what is needed and don’t lean on things too much. You let relationships lay out there and have air to breathe. The Hunter only exposes himself to the wind when necessary such as with life you don’t overuse and tire people. Don’t exhaust others and be Hungary and desperate. Dont eat 5 quail. Hunter knows he will always catch pray so he never worries about luring things into his trap. When you worry, you clean the things out of desperation, and when you clean your bound to be exhausted or exhaust who you cling to. A hunter uses his world sparingly, and with tenderness always conscious to not be over using the resource and feeding the environment. Hunters tap the world and take what feeds them and nothing more. Be a man be constantly relaxed and at rest give energy to the world.
- Explanations arent necessary, only action. When man decides to do some thing, he must go all the way, but take responsibility for what he does. You must first know why he’s doing it and then proceeded without doubts with his actions. There is no room for regrets for remorse. Don Juan sees himself as able to die at any time and accepts that. He has no room for death or remorse if he is to die he must die. He can’t be preoccupied with death. Carlos sees himself as immortal and that leads to regret and self doubt. When death is the hunter there is no room for regrets or doubts just decisions. To assume the responsibility of your decisions means you’re willing to die for them even if someone presents an idea you need to buy in fully if you accept to do it. In the world, where death is the Hunter there are no bigger small decisions. Just decisions we make in the face of our inevitable death. Carlos tells a story of off his dad setting an alarm to get up at 6 am to swim he’d get out of bed stretch then fall asleep for another 4-6 hours. Carlos thought his dad was a weak man for this. But Don Juan thought that Carlos should’ve still swam even without his dad. Commitments are to ourselves. If he agreed to go it doesn’t matter if his dad didn’t. The story of the gourds and spirit deer. A man down on his luck stumbled on an older man with gords he wanted help moving to the mountains the young man was starving and given food and then the old man summoned a spirit deee and gave the young man the option of the gords or the deer to guide him in life. The man thinking there was more than food in the gords deliberated and took those to only find food. Then he smashed them on a rock in anger. Thinking he had made the wrong decision. He didn’t understand his decision or his power. A starving man throwing out food he needed because it wasn’t a spirit guide is ironic and demonstrates a misunderstanding of power and living with your decisions in life.

    - **Note:** Take action do not do things 50% and own the situation. No room for regrets or remorse. Accept we may die at any time and leave no room for regret or remorse. Death is always hunting us and this leaves no room for regrets or doubts just decisions. Full send you need to be willing to die for your decisions. Make a commitment and stick to it but commitments are only to ourselves not anyone else. We cannot misunderstand power of decisions in our lives. Sometimes enlightenment comes in different forms
- Lose self importance and don’t take yourself so seriously. Be able to talk with plants since you’ve lost your sense of self importance. He talks with plants that tell him where other plants of that kind are then he thanks them. Were all gods creatures living as one we must thank everything including the plants. The world is a mystery if a little plan is generous with us we shouldn’t let us go. How can you expect to learn about plants. Death is our eternal companion it is always to our left at an arms length it’s always watching you over your shoulder until it taps you. How can we feel important when death is stalking us. When you’re feeling impatient turn to your left and ask advice from your death pettiness is dropped when you do this. You recognize your own mortality makes you humble. We can always see our death. Death is the only wise advisor we have. When everything is going wrong you turn to death and realize nothing matters outside of its touch. Death is the Hunter do not be petty accept death. The joy of existing without any optimization. Your mood changes how you view the world. The world exists and is neutral the universe talks to you by you talking to yourself.
- Look to the universe to see what it tells us for our decisions. Maybe it can actually speak to us maybe we can speak to ourselves through it. Regardless we must listen in both regards. A man can get agreements for everything around him. Don Juan got agreement fell a fighter jet and coffee machine well timed. You can quit anything instantly like booze or cigs. Don Juan one day just stopped drinking. Anyone can just stop. He thanked the coffee for agreeing with him. He says that he gave up his personal history like he gave up drinking. Everyone who knows you has an idea about you and we constantly feed this. We renew it by recounting who we are but if we have no personal history no explanations are needed no one gets mad with your acts of pins you down. Erasing our personal history makes us free from the unincunbering thiufhts of others. Erase yourself your moods are too real forget yourself and be one with the universe. We either know everything for sure or know nothing. When we know nothing everything is magic we always alert.
- For a sorcerer the world isn’t out there somewhere reality is only a description. Your view of the world is just a description that people have pounded into your head. Everyone teaches the world to us and we become adults when we start to understand the world ourselves. We become a member of society when we take agency over our lives. Stopping the world is the first step to seeing it. Warriors don’t confront bluntly but strategically. Fright doesn’t hurt the spirit what hurts the spirit is being told what to do constantly. We need to stop the world. When you hold onto reality you become deaf and blind to the world. We need to break the dogmatic certainty of the validity of our perceptions of the world. We must believe we can question the world.

    - **Note:** Question our reality we must break the certainty of our worldly perceptions. The world is a description a path other people have given us and it's up to us to stop the world and carve our own path. Pain is being told what to do and enlightenment is living truly to who you are within yourself. Stop the world take agency over yourself and life.
