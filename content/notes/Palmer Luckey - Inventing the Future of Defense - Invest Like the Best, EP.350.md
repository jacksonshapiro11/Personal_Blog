### Highlights

- Episode AI notes
  1. Advancements in technology can make previously discarded technologies feasible and cost-effective.
  2. The Pentagon's priorities and beliefs, as well as Congress's decisions, play a crucial role in determining the success and funding of defense projects.
  3. Projects that can be efficiently executed without major disruptions and offer opportunities for success in areas where other companies are underperforming have higher chances of success and avoid wasteful spending.

    - **Note:** He was a student of history and would go back to figure out what others had worked on to see if feasible he also came up with novel solutions to existing problems.
      He wants to effect real change and to do that you need to innovate in your value chain not try to go outside the institutions. He wants to work in areas where he has the most leverage in second rate products and with current stakeholders
- The Future of VR
  Key takeaways:
  - What were people thinking when they were thinking bigger and considering previously discarded technologies? (e.g., Real-time distortion correction)
  - Real-time distortion correction existed in the 1980s and 1990s but was discarded due to computational expenses.
  - No one revisited the idea of real-time distortion correction until now when computers have become more powerful and affordable.
  - Modern graphics cards can perform real-time transforms at a significantly lower cost than before.

  What were people thinking when they were thinking bigger, when they were willing to look at wackier paths, when they were willing to consider things that have been eliminated often Because technologies just weren't ready. There's a lot of technologies that have been discarded because they weren't practical at the time and nobody ever revisited them and said, hey, I actually think the time has come. A good example is with the RIF. Doing real-time distortion correction is not a new idea. It existed in the 1980s and the 1990s in the virtual reality community. It had been discarded even by NASA. There's a fascinating NASA paper where they talk about doing real-time geometry distortion correction on a virtual reality headset that made the optics lower distortion and allowed Them to therefore use wider field of view, lighter weight optics than would have otherwise been required to have an optically perfect image. And the conclusion was, yeah, this is a really good way to save money and to save weight, but it's too computationally expensive. We're using most of our processing power to warp the image in real-time rather than render this wireframe image. And so this is not a good approach. You should just do it optically and then you don't have to have a more expensive computer. But back then, compute was the expensive part. And the optic transform used up a lot of your compute. Nobody reexamined this idea even as computers got better. Nobody went back until me and said, wait a sec, you can do real-time transforms on a modern graphics card for like one or two percent of your render horsepower. And also your graphics card doesn't cost $100,000 anymore. ([Time 0:25:11](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fcc8a5e5-84c9-407b-bec0-fe981ba1b257))

    - **Note:** Wants to make a big impact in the world. Willing to go back im history to find novel solutions or old ideas that fell to history. He is mission driven only cares about making an impact. Student of history. Does things because they’re important not because he likes them. He’s a psycho and machine. Thinks outside the box but world in industry’s that think inside the box like defense as a competitive advantage wants to make an impact above everything. Understand the existing problems and create a novel solution. You need to build within the existing valor chain and understand how that works to really effect real change.
- Priority, Persuasion, and Congressional Importance in Engineering Efforts
  Key takeaways:
  - The Pentagon's priorities and beliefs are key factors in determining what projects get attention and funding.
  - Congress holds the power of the purse and decides which projects are important and which ones are not.
  - Projects that can be done well without significant reorientation are more attractive.
  - Investing in areas where other companies are performing poorly may offer opportunities for success.

  Speaker 1
  So when we do something, I think there's four things that need to be true. First, it has to be something that the Pentagon cares about. It has to be something they think is a priority because if they don't think it's a priority, it doesn't even matter if it should be a priority. If they're not convinced it should be a priority, it's probably not something that is going to get fixed in the near term. If I think something is a priority and the Pentagon disagrees, that's not an engineering effort I need to deploy. That's probably a persuasion effort that I need to deploy. Don't start the engineering on something when you haven't successfully persuaded them. Most of the time they know what their problems are. Two has to be something that Congress cares about. They have the power of the purse. They decide what is going to get funded. They decide what programs are going to get allocation. They decide which ones are going to get killed. And so if Congress believes that something is important, you're probably going to do better than if it's something that they think is a waste of time or the pet project of some billionaire. That's just the way that it is. This is one of those things where perception is reality. If they think it's not important, I have to act as if it isn't or try to persuade them otherwise. I can't just go out and build a Batmobile and say, hey, I built the Batmobile. Check out how sick it is. You guys should fund this. That happens from time to time, but those are the exceptions that prove the rule. And then the third thing is it has to be something we can do well. I know that sounds obvious, but doing well often means can we reuse things we already have. Can we move fast? Is this something we can do without totally reorienting our whole business? Those are going to be the most attractive things. And then finally, the last category is other people have to be doing a bad job. I don't want to spend our money rebuilding things that other companies are already doing well just because I think that I could do slightly better or that I could just make money in that Area in a vacuum. This is probably the least rational part of the process. Could Andrew make a lot of money making small tactical quadcopters for surveillance? Things like the short range reconnaissance drone going on US infantry. The answer is, yeah, we could definitely make a lot of money doing that. I think we'd be very successful at ([Time 0:45:48](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4a814310-51fb-4640-bb64-f8c98b3e8403))
    - **Note:** Wants to build something that pentagon wants will get funded by congress that has second class competition and is in the companys circle of competence.
