  I think broadly, it's anything that's going to prevent you from achieving the goals that you want. That's a very basic answer, but I think that's what it is. And the reason that's important is because take volatility in the stock market. Is that risk? Well, it could be. If you're a day trader, then yes. The market goes down tomorrow. That's a risk for you. If you're going to retire in 50 years, it's not whatsoever. So just defining it in personal terms is I think the most important. But a lot of finance is not that. They define risk as volatility, whatever it might be, recessions, all these different things, but it's a very personal answer. What is risky for me might not be for you and vice versa. And this is what gets back to most financial debates or people with different time horizons talking over each other. There's a quote I love that is personal finance is more personal than it is finance. That is really important for everyone. You and I should not pretend that risk for Renaissance technology is going to be the same for you and I within our personal households. It's completely and utterly different. So anything that pulls you away from whatever goals you personally have is what I would define as risk.
  Speaker 2
  If you had to break down the skill differences between accumulating money, keeping money and spending money, how would you do that?
  Speaker 1
  I've often defined it as getting rich and staying rich are completely different skills. And there's not that many people who are equally skilled in getting rich versus staying rich. There's a sliver society that's very good at getting rich that has no ability to stay rich. And there's some people who are very good at holding on to money, but much less talented at having a good time. There's less talented at building it and growing it over time. When you have both skills combined, it's a very special thing. Buffet is obviously that Bill Gates is that there's a handful of people who are extremely good at getting rich and have stayed rich. Very well. The example that I always use is Bill Gates when he started Microsoft took the most audacious entrepreneurial swing that maybe anyone's ever taken of saying every desk in the world Needs computer on this and he's saying this in 1974, whatever it was. He had a crazy amount of risk, crazy bold vision. At the same time, he said that he always wanted Microsoft to have enough cash in the bank to make payroll for one year with no revenue, which is the most conservative, pessimistic way To run a business. He's very risk taking and very conservative paranoid at the same time. Very good at getting rich, very good at staying rich at the same time. It's very unique to have both of those acting at the same time. And I think at the individual level, you can have it too. My net worth, you'd say, is very barbelled. A lot of cash, that's the paranoid conservative side and stocks that I hope to hold for 50 years. That's incredibly audacious that this is actually going to work out over the next half century. And I don't think that's any contradiction. It's just trying to get both of the skills of getting rich and staying rich work at the same time.
