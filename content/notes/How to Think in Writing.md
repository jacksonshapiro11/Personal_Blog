- Summary: Writing helps refine thinking by making ideas more precise and complete. Without writing, one may not fully form or realize the limitations of their ideas. By unfolding and probing claims through writing, one can discover flaws, refine understanding, and reach deeper insights.

### Highlights

- When I write, I push myself to make definite positive claims. Ambiguity allows thought to remain fluid on the page, floating into a different meaning when put under pressure. This makes it harder to push your thinking deeper. By making clear and sharp claims, I reveal my understanding so that I—or the person I’m writing to—can see the state of my knowledge and direct their feedback to the point where it will help my thinking improve.
  This is valuable to do even in areas where you know way too little to “warrant” an opinion. I met a Japanese linguist in the harbor yesterday and talked about the relationship between the Chinese and the Japanese writing systems. This is a topic I had thought about for about twenty seconds before this. “So,” I said after two minutes, “this is a stupid question, but is the relationship between China and Japan like that between Ancient Greece and the Roman Empire?” This is, as it turns out, not a good analogy. But by spelling out my naive understanding, I gave the linguist a good area to work on when he laid out a richer model of the flow of cultural influence in East Asia.
  In the terminology of mathematics, what I did here (and in my writing) was to “make a conjecture,” a qualified guess based on limited information. A hypothesis. The mathematician Alexander Grothendieck, whom Johanna and I [have written about elsewhere](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/good-ideas), would always summarize his first impression of a new situation with a conjecture, proclaiming with irrepressible enthusiasm, “It must be true!” Ten seconds later, someone would come up with a counterexample that proved him wrong. But being right wasn’t the point: getting a better understanding was. And he would immediately throw out a new conjecture. (Holden Karnofsky has a blog post about using this technique to [learn through writing](https://www.cold-takes.com/learning-by-writing/).)

    - **Note:** When you’re writing you make a conjecture about the world in clear English then offer refutations. Writing something down and defining it also defines everything it isn’t. You can’t be wrong on an ambiguous idea. Writing makes you commit to a path and accept failure to grow through failure and create better ideas.
- There are several subtle problems with this conclusion. But the point is—these problems didn’t come into view until we had unfolded and probed our original position.
  The way we unfolded and improved our conclusion back then was more haphazard than it would have been today. We just talked about it aimlessly, read randomly, and made small notes. This cost us time and caused confusion. These days, I would instead unfold a conclusion like this as a series of bullet points where I spell out the intuition behind my claim in a series of premises. In the case of Maud’s education, this would have looked something like this (note that this is not my current understanding but a reconstruction of what I thought eight years ago):
  • People have an intrinsic motivation to learn and it is important to not undermine that, which schools do
  • It is better to go deep on a few topics that you are passionate about rather than have a superficial understanding of a broad range of subjects you care little about
  • But you need to attend a school so you get socialized
  • Hence, we need to find a school that allows self-directed learning
  Once I unfold my understanding in writing, I often see holes right away. I start correcting myself and discarding ideas already while typing. I cut ideas that are obviously flawed. I rewrite what feels ambiguous to make it sharper–more precise, concrete, unhedged, and true to my understanding.
  The flaws I see immediately, however, are only the more superficial flaws. The deeper patterns take a longer time to emerge—because they are further from my established thoughts and so are harder to articulate. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3bh3em9s774bhgnrgrw8mab))
    - **Note:** When you write your assumptions down you become clear about your feelings you commit to a path which is vital for progress but bad for feelings.
- Counterexamples are useful in two ways. Either you find a counterexample that a) proves one of the premises wrong but b) does not change your mind about the conclusion. Lakatos calls this a local (and non-global) counterexample. This means there is something wrong with your unfolding. Perhaps you need to change that part of the explanation? Or perhaps you can simply drop it, making the mental model simpler and more general? Local counterexamples help you improve your explanation and get a better understanding.

    - **Note:** Counter examples help you look for conflicting evidence and sometimes this is small and local but other times it could be global and completely change your idea. Local is a logic fallacy for a correct conclusion but global is a wider conclusion issue.
