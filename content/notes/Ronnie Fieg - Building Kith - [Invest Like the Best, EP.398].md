### Highlights

- Cultivate Your Passion Relentlessly
  Summary:
  Embracing personal passion in every aspect of life fosters self-fulfillment and excellence.
  By promoting the idea that one should love what they create and aspire to surpass their own standards, individuals can strive to be the best versions of themselves. This mindset extends beyond work to relationships and personal development, emphasizing the importance of being a dedicated family member and a responsible individual.
  Furthermore, the concept that the reward for great work is more work illustrates a continuous cycle of growth and ambition, revealing how initial efforts in passion projects can evolve into iconic brands.

  Speaker 1
  Because I'm just head to toe, like footwear, socks, pants, underwear, shirt, over shirt, hat, glasses, car, bag is all my brand. I always dreamed of being able to do that. Because it would be like one piece or two pieces of my outfit. And it would bother me. It would bother me that it wasn't something I created for myself.
  Speaker 2
  I love the prompt of what do you love more than anybody else you know, and leaning into that aggressively for whatever it is you create. I love that prompt.
  Speaker 1
  By the way, I'm a big fan of that because I always tell people, if you're not the hardest working person you know, then you're not working hard enough. That's another iteration of that. It's a competition within yourself of being the best version of yourself. I want to do that in every facet of my life, not just in my work. I want to be the best dad that I know. I want to be the most efficient person I know with time. I want to be the best family member of my extended family that I know. Try to be as caring as I can and always trying to better yourself in every facet. I think that that's been a piece of something that I've learned throughout my career that I've been able to transfer that over to other pieces of my life, which has been great.
  Speaker 2
  I love the line, the reward for great work is more work. And it seems like Kith has been an unfolding version of that. Can you describe the very earliest days of Kith, the brand, what the name came from, how it came together? It's become iconic.

    - **Note:** Be the best at everything work and family and life. Be the best person you know.
- Passion Fuels Powerful Storytelling
  Summary:
  A deep passion for film and storytelling can transform brand communication, making it more authentic and engaging.
  By immersing oneself in cinematic experiences and collaborating with passionate individuals, brands can integrate film into their identity, creating a platform for storytelling that reflects their values. Successful collaborations demand a clear narrative that honors the legacy of each brand involved while educating consumers about the significance of products.
  Understanding the 'why' behind every story enhances its impact, promoting a connection between the brand and its audience.
  Continual evolution in storytelling methods keeps the brand's communication fresh and relevant, thereby establishing a high standard for each new project.

  Speaker 1
  She probably saw like maybe 2% of the movies I've seen. So then it became putting her on in the same way and making her watch all these movies that I got to relive. And then going to the theater twice a week and watching films. It was pretty incredible. So my passion for film was very important to me. And it became a part of my DNA in how I would love to see the brand be able to communicate through the medium of film. I would say the real start for this was the New York love story. And there were two chapters of the New York love story. And that was my first attempt at showcasing product through the setting of New York City, but also through this short film that would be like Billy Crystal feel. When I think about When Harry Met Sally, like through that kind of vibe, that was the first concept I had for showcasing a fall collection in New York City is this love story between these Two people. And then we continued that and had this part two, which I didn't love as much, but that was my attempt and it was good, not great. As time progressed, one of my employees who started off as an intern, his name is Austin, became my right hand and also through my relationship with him, he fell in love with film as well. This happened recently, I would say in the last few years. And started to research how we would take this to the next level because he's basically the head of content for me. And we started to take it a lot more seriously because I told him that I wanted this to be a major part of what we do, these films. So he did his part by doing some research and figuring out the talent that we needed to work with to bring these things to life, these mini films to life. And we did that. And it started to become a huge part of our DNA in how we storytell. And it really checks off a lot of these boxes for me and Austin with how we feel people should experience the product or seeing the product through the most passionate way for us to feel Accomplished. I think that that's what makes it feel organic is people understanding that when I feel accomplished, it's so much better of a place to be than for it to feel forceful in the way that I tell A story or in the way that I present product. So now with understanding that we could do that on a very high level, because the videos are insane now. They're incredible. And I'm so proud of them. It was a struggle to get it easy. But now that we know we could do that, when we create product in its inception of creating product, we are already understanding that we can tell a story on the highest level. So it expands the spectrum of the product I can work on and makes me feel a lot more comfortable working on some of the products that I do, especially Armani, for example.
  Speaker 2
  What have you learned that might be applicable to others? Because I think it's amazing how many different domains these set of ideas could be powerful. What have you learned about a great collaboration with Armani's another brand that people could buy in some weird way? It might be thought of as a competitor. I know I'm sure you don't think about it that way, obviously, but it's in the same category. What have you learned about just running these collaborations and thinking all the way back to that first lunch break you had effectively? Like what are the ingredients of a great episodic collaboration or partnership? Like the ones you've done, you've done more of them than just about anybody probably.
  Speaker 1
  So I'm gonna bring you back to the first BMW project that we worked on. The E30 M3 is probably the most culturally relevant car in my market ever. It's so, so, so iconic. And in trying to explain what the car meant to BMW, BMW produced the M3 without the intention of it becoming commercialized. It was a race car.
  Speaker 2
  I didn't know that.
  Speaker 1
  It was a race car. They had a three series that was on the road, but then they created this M version of it to be a race car. And the car won multiple awards. And the driver, Johnny Chakoto, won multiple races. When I told the story about the E30 M3, which was a one-off car that BMW in Germany rebuilt for me, alongside the M4, which I introduced to the world. The M4 was introduced through us. When we told the story, it was so important for us to tell a story about this Cinnabar Red M3, E30 M3. That color was so iconic. And what I wanted to do was to showcase the M4 is basically the newest version of the old M3. So I wanted to bridge the story for people to understand the DNA of where it came from. So we got Johnny Chikoto and his son to drive the E30 M3. And that was Johnny Chikoto and his son to drive the M4. His son is also a race car driver. So I put both cars on the track to race each other in these two cars. And it was basically to showcase the E30 M3 and the M4 and to explain, show people the visual and bridging the two together. Being able to do that on a high level. So you asked me a question about collaboration and how I work on some of these bigger moments with these bigger brands. When I have these type of ideas for a brand like BMW, it's refreshing for them, for someone to want to come in and tell that story through their point of view. And I think that me describing that to you right now is how brands feel across the board on the projects that I work on. Because my love for the product that I work on, they can't doubt the passion that I have for it. Once we sit down and we figure out what the storytelling will be. It always comes from wanting to celebrate the brand I work with, not from wanting to put my version of it above their history and heritage on why that product is important to the world. Incredible. Yeah. So with every collaboration, I feel the responsibility to need to educate people on the why. Here's what happened through time is the why becomes a lot more of a burden because of how we've been able to storytell. So these bigger storytelling moments now have set ([Time 0:54:01](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a4ca527b-a817-456a-9029-be4f5b894cc5))
    - **Note:** Story telling and the why of things. Does this need to be told.
