### Highlights

- Flow – a state in which you are so involved in an activity nothing else matters and your attention is very focused

  Eight components of flow
  1. Clear Goal – if an activity is unclear you can break it up into smaller goals
  2. Feedback – strong feedback loops both positive and negative
  3. Challenges matching skills – not too hard not too easy on the edge
  4. Concentration – total concentration on the task
  5. Focus – all other problems fade away
  6. Control – you are on the edge of control
  7. Less of self consciousness – you forget yourself and who you are
  8. Transformation of time – time either moves slower or faster
