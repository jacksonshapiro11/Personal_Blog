### Highlights

- Find People Who Believe in You & Your Ability To Learn Anything
  Key takeaways:
  - Believe in yourself and know that you can achieve.
  - Millions of kids and adults have been given the message they cannot achieve things.
  - Adults may reconsider their choices and go back to school to change careers.

  Do you have a device for young people? We've been talking about mathematics quite a bit but in terms of their journey through education, through their career choices through life, maybe middle school, high school, undergrad students of how to live a life that they can be proud of.
  Speaker 1
  I think if I were to give advice to people, especially young people, my advice would be to always, it sounds really corny, but always believe in yourself and know that you can achieve because, although that sounds like obvious, of course we want kids to know that they can achieve things. I know that millions of kids are in the school system have been given the message they cannot do things. And adults too, they have the idea, oh, I did okay in this, I went into this job because those other things I could never have done okay in. So actually when they hear, hey, maybe you could do those other things. Even adults think, you know, maybe I can. And they go back and they encounter this knowledge and they relearn things and they change careers and amazing things happen. So for me, I think that message is really important. You can learn anything. Scientists try and find a limit. They're always trying to find a limit. Like how much can you really learn? What's the limit to how much you can learn? And they always come away not being able to find it. People can just go further and further and further. And that is true of people born with brain, you know, areas of their brain that aren't functioning well that have what we call special needs. Some of those people also go on to develop and do amazing things. So I think that really experiencing that, knowing that, not just saying it, but knowing it deeply, you can learn anything is something I wish all people would have.
  Speaker 2
  Actually also applies when you've achieved some level of success to what I find, like in my life with people that love me, when you achieve success, they keep celebrating your success and they want you to keep doing the thing that you were successful at as opposed to believing in that you can do something else, something big, whatever your heart says to do. And one of the things that I realized the value of this, you know, quite recently, which is sad to say, is how important it is to seek out, when you're younger to seek out mentors, to seek out the people, like surround yourself with people that will believe in you. It's like a little bit is on you. It's like you don't get that sometimes you could go to a grad school, you think you kind of land on a mentor, maybe you pick a mentor based on the topic they're interested in. But the reality is the people you surround yourself with, they're going to define your life, trajectory. So select people that.
  Speaker 1
  That's really true. And get away from people who don't believe in you.
  Speaker 2
  Sometimes parents can be that, they love you deeply, but they set, it's the math thing we mentioned, they might set certain constraints on the beliefs that you have. And so in that, if you're interested in mathematics, the parents are not that interested in it, don't listen to your parents on that one dimension.
  Speaker 3
  Exactly.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah. And if people tell you you can't do things, you have to hear from other people who believe in you, I think you're absolutely right about that. So sad the number of people who've had those negative messages from parents, in my limitless mind book, I interviewed quite a few people who'd been told they couldn't do math, sometimes by parents, sometimes by teachers. And fortunately they had got other ideas at some point in their life and realized there was this whole world of mathematical thinking that was open to them. So it's really important that people do connect with people who believe in them. However hard that might be to find those people.

    - **Note:** Knowing and believing in your ability to learn and do anything. Surround yourself with mentors who believe in you. The people you surround yourself with will define you. Don’t listen to people who don’t believe in you. Don’t constrain your beliefs.
