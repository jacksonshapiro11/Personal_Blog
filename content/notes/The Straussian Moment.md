### Highlights

- From the Enlightenment on, modern political philosophy has been character- ized by the abandonment of a set of questions that an earlier age had deemed central: What is a well-lived life? What does it mean to be human? What is the nature of the city and humanity? How does culture and religion fit into all of this? For the modern world, the death of God was followed by the disappear- ance of the question of human nature. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hybmpjdnawx22gdz2nj2bt3e))

    - **Note:** we used to wonder about human nature but now we view everyone as homo economicus. We misunderstand human nature. We as the west shed so much blood in the name of god. Previously men fought over the nature of virtue and true religion but when philosophy was modernized these issues were seen as too thorny and were side stepped in order to keep the peace. Religion and virtue were sacrificed for peace of mind through money. Long/ short term incentive misalignment
- However, at the end of this process, agreement had become more elusive than ever, the differences greater than ever. The violence had failed to create a new unity. This failure was formalized in the Peace of Westphalia, so that 1648 can be fixed as the single year that dates the birth of the modern era. Questions of virtue and the true religion henceforth would be decided by each sovereign. The sovereigns would agree to disagree. Inexorably, ques- tions of virtue and religion became private questions; polite and respectable individuals learned not to talk about them too much, because they could lead to nothing but unproductive conflicts.
  For the modern world, questions about the nature of humanity would be viewed on par with the struggle among the Lilliputians about the correct way to cut open an egg. Hobbes, the first truly modern philosopher, boasted of how he deserted and ran away from fighting in a religious war; a cowardly life had become preferable to a heroic but meaningless death. Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori had been an important part of the old tradition; henceforth, it would be seen as nothing more than an old lie.
  And so, the Enlightenment undertook a major strategic retreat. If the only way to stop people from killing one another about the right way to open an egg involved a world where nobody thought about it too much, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hybnvaceqd83p9bqv7ka7sfw))
    - **Note:** The problem was declared too hard and avoided
- In a capitalist world, violent debates about truth—whether they concern questions of religion and virtue or questions about the nature of humanity— interfere with the productive conduct of commerce. It is therefore best for such questions to be eliminated or obscured. Thus, in Hobbes, all human complexity is reduced to the desire for power: The passions that most of all cause the difference of wit, are principally, the more or less desire of power, of riches, of knowledge, and of honour.
  All which may be reduced to the first, that is, desire of power. For riches, knowledge, and honour, are but several sorts of power.!® In Locke’s Essay Concerning Human Understanding, the author elaborates the conception of power, while stripping it even further of.anything that is specifically human: the will is the power to prefer one action over another; liberty is the power to act on this preference; the understanding is a power; a substance is merely the power to produce certain empirical effects, but these effects tell us nothing of the nature of the underlying substance.!’ Once again, Locke proceeds cautiously. He does not directly tell us that human nature does not exist or that the older tradition of Aristotle or Aquinas is definitively wrong; he does not seek that clear a break with the past,!8 but he undermines the older tradition relentlessly, for when we observe things (and these things include other people), we can see only their secondary effects as manifested by their various powers.!? We cannot know anything about their true natures or substances; it is an irreducible part of the human condition for humans to be limited, so that they can never know anything about the nature of humanity.”° To ask a question about human substance, or the teleology of humanity’s power, leads to debates as meaningless as “whether the best Relish were to be found in Apples, Plumbs, or Nuts.”?!

    - **Note:** We dont need to know the fundimental questions just seek happiness because those fundimental questions create issues
- And so, a religious war has been brought to a land that no longer cares for religious wars. Even President Bush, who styles himself a religious conserva- tive, cannot bring himself to believe that it is religion that really matters: “[T]his great nation of many religions understands our war is not against Islam or against the faith practiced by the Muslim people.”28 Where Bush downplays the differences, bin Laden emphasizes them, contrasting the world of pure Islam and the world of the decadent West in the most extreme way imaginable: “[Tlhe love of this world is wrong. You should love the other world . . . die in the right cause and go to the other world.”?9 Unfortunately, bin Laden is not simply an irrelevant crackpot of the sort that one might find screaming at the bemused spectators in Hyde Park. For bin Laden, unlike Locke, hard questions of morality and conduct need no postponement; their answers are clear and resolution cannot be delayed. Bin Laden is a passionate man of wealth and power, so that his personal example reminds us of the boundary cases Locke so readily dismissed.

    - **Note:** religious differences
- The west has looked at the religious and fundamental questions of life and put those on the backburner saying anyone can believe what they want but we should really focus on capitalism and self preservation making money instead of contemplating deep questions of existence. The west does not think that its worth being poor and hungry for some slight moral religion high ground. However, the middle eastern religions start with them being morally right and seeing the world correctly and if they believe that is the way of the world and everyone is evil who doesnt agree with them. Foundational values of self preservation giving up any religious or moral ideals that could cause massive arguements vs the middle east core of religion and this is the way of the world vs caring about people living good lives just concerned about virtuous lives instead of pursuit of happiness.

    - **Note:** The west has focused on living a good material life while the middle east has focused on living a virtuous life. This is a cultural gap we in the west thing more stuff and more money will make people happier but in the middle east the commitment and transcendence through god is higher in the stack and we cannot understand this. Interesting juxtaposition virtues vs happiness and misaligned incentives
- And then one encounters Schmitt’s troubling challenge. A side in which everyone, like Hobbes, values this earthly life more than death is a side where everyone will run away from fighting and confrontation; but when one runs away from an enemy that continues to fight, one is ultimately going to lose—no matter how great the numerical or technological superiority may appear at the outset. Schmitt’s solution to this impending defeat demands an affirmation of the political in the West. Here, however, one must confront an alternative and perhaps even more troubling conclusion. For let us assume that it is possible, somehow, to turn back the clock and set aside our uncertainties; that we can return to the faith of Cromwell and Urban II; that we understand Islam as the providential enemy of the West; and that we can then respond to Islam with the same ferocity with which it is now attacking the West. This would be a Pyrrhic victory, for it would come at the price of doing away with everything that fundamentally distinguishes the modern West from Islam.

    - **Note:** One side will never stop fighting and so they cannot lose eventually if you dont lose you win
- The Hegelian Alexandre Kojéve believed that the end of history would be marked by the definitive abandonment of all the hard questions. Humanity itself would disappear, but there would no longer be any conflict: If Man becomes an animal again, his acts, his loves, and his play must also become purely “natural” again. Hence it would have to be admitted that after the end of History, men would construct their edifices and works of art as birds build their nests and spiders spin their webs. . . . “The definitive anni- hilation of Man properly so-called” also means the definitive disappearance of human Discourse (Logos) in the strict sense. Animals of the species Homo sapiens would react by conditioned reflexes to vocal signals or sign “language,” and thus their so-called “discourses” would be like what is supposed to be the “language” of bees. What would disappear, then, is not only Philosophy or the search for discursive Wisdom, but also that Wisdom itself.
  Schmitt echoes these sentiments, albeit with rather different conclusions. In such a unified world, “what remains is neither politics nor state, but culture, civilization, economics, morality, law, art, entertainment, etc.”** The world of “entertainment” represents the culmination of the shift away from politics.
  A representation of reality might appear to replace reality: instead of violent wars, there could be violent video games; instead of heroic feats, there could be thrilling amusement park rides; instead of serious thought, there could be “intrigues of all sorts,” as in a soap opera. It is a world where people spend their lives amusing themselves to death. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyr1me56gxnm4tz5dn5yscrr))
    - **Note:** We leave the world of meaning seeking for the world of entertainment we never actually have to try anything because its like a video game there is always an extra life, so were never taking risks were never really living were just entertaining ourselves
- The world where everything seems to administer itself is the world of science fiction, of Stephenson’s Snow Crash, or of The Matrix for those who choose not to take their red pills. But no representation of reality ever is the same as reality, and one must never lose sight of the larger framework within which the representation exists. The price of abandoning oneself to such an artificial representation is always too high, because the decisions that are avoided are always too important.°° By making people forget that they have souls, the Antichrist will succeed in swindling people out of them.>!

- But within a few pages, we find that even in the case of the American Founding, this patriotic account is not neces- sarily the whole truth, and the reader is informed that perhaps “America owes her greatness not only to her habitual adherence to the principles of freedom and justice, but also to her occasional deviation from them.””° Moreover, we are told that there exists a “mischievous interpretation of the Louisiana Pur- chase and of the fate of the Red Indians.””! Indeed, the philosopher’s decision to write esoterically reminds us that even in America, the most liberal regime in history, there remain politically incorrect taboos.” In reminding us of the permanent problems, the political philosopher agrees with the political theologian’s exhortation to seriousness and also joins the latter in rejecting as illusory the notion that “everything has been taken care of.” But because the philosopher does not share all the theologian’s hopes and fears, there is more freedom in steering a middle course between “the Scylla of ‘absolutism’ and the Charybdis of ‘relativism.’””? As Strauss puts it, “[t]here is a universally valid hierarchy of ends, but there are no universally valid rules of action.””* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyr2nxw2y40hk5yxbnzhqcqy))
    - **Note:** clear goals flexible execution you need to have clear goals and a clear vision and youre defined by the rules you choose to break as much as the ones you set and live by. Relativism is what makes the world the world. The founders of the US made rules no one after could ever have the power to do. Break rules well
- From a Girardian perspective, the current political debates remain inadequate for the contemporary world situation to the extent that, across the spectrum, there remains a denial of the founding role of the violence caused by human mimesis and, therefore, a systematic underestimation of the scope of apocalyptic violence. Nuclear weapons pose a horrific dilemma, but one could Gust barely) imagine a nuclear standoff in which a handful of states remain locked in a cold war. But what if mimesis drives others to try and acquire these same weapons for the mimetic prestige they confer, so that the technological situation is never static, but instead contains a powerful escala- tory dynamic?
  One may define a “liberal” as someone who knows nothing of the past and of this history of violence, and still holds to the Enlightenment view of the natural goodness of humanity. And one may define a “conservative” as some- one who knows nothing of the future and of the global world that is destined to be, and therefore still believes that the nation-state or other institutions rooted in sacred violence can contain unlimited human violence. The present risks a terrible synthesis of the blind spots in that doctrinaire thinking, a synthesis of violence and globalization in which all boundaries on violence are abolished, be they geographic, professional (for example, civilian non- combatants), or demographic (for example, children). At the extremes, even the distinction between violence inflicted on oneself and violence inflicted on other people is in the process of evaporating, in the disturbing new phenom- enon of suicide-murderers. The word that best describes this unbounded, apocalyptic violence is “terrorism.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz32p0e6kth2x3fze7pw2eyh))
    - **Note:** mimetic theory applied to politics leading to cultivating other and violence. Because we naturally covet things we cant have we are destined for future conflict fighting over the same things continuously and cannot have global peace and also cannot trust our institutions
