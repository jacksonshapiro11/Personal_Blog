### Highlights

- Value Beyond Prestige
  Summary:
  Reactions to acceptance into prestigious institutions like Harvard can vary greatly.
  For some, such news elicits excitement and pride; for others, it is met with a measured response, signaling a deeper understanding of value. The individual’s focus appears to be less on the status of attending Harvard and more on the opportunity to engage with a community of like-minded, ambitious peers.
  This indicates that personal growth and intellectual challenge often outweigh the symbolic importance of prestigious accolades.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  His dad sort of filming his reaction, and he's pretty measured about it. It's very, yep, got into Harvard, and then kind of goes back to doing something else on his computer.
  Speaker 2
  Yep. And I think for most kids, for most people in the world, you would look at that and be like, what arrogance? And look, it's not like 18-year Mark is not arrogant. But I think it's also, this is why all this stuff we've been talking about is important. It's just not that important to him. Stuff. He knows it has value. He knows people will use it. Whether he goes to Harvard, doesn't go to Harvard, goes to college, doesn't go to college, it's just not that big a deal to him, I don't think. Yeah.
  Speaker 1
  Reading in between the lines, it seems like the thing that he was most excited about is, oh, good, a challenging environment where I will encounter other really smart people like myself Who are ambitious.
  Speaker 2
  Yes, I think that is totally right. So Mark gets to Harvard in fall of 2002. And, you know, like you said, he goes to class, he does well, but he wants to meet other people and be around other smart folks. ([Time 0:23:29](https://share.snipd.com/snip/56eb4adc-2bcb-4489-ab14-127624e9c053))
    - **Note:** Doesn’t care about getting into Harvard just loves building and making things. Mark ks just a fucking Genuis growing up holy fuck. He’s always building side projects. Mark doesn’t care about school only side projects. Friendster was too much of a dating app not a friends app which was its biggest issue. He learned with every project. First time you don’t need money or permission to do something cool. They created an ad partnership with Microsoft that led to all their revenue and created the quintessential start up culture. New tech enabled new ways to ship every day influenced the company. Facebook became a platform with gaming but wasn’t the most power because they existed to abstracted from the core browsers.
- Ideas Are Everywhere, Execution Matters Most
  Summary:
  The concept of creating a digital social network based on the Harvard Facebook was not unique; multiple universities had similar initiatives.
  Various schools had proposed their versions before, indicating a widespread interest in such platforms. The Winklevoss twins capitalized on this common idea, needing Mark as a programmer to bring their vision to life.
  Despite the historical and collective nature of this idea, Mark had a unique ability to generate excitement and execute compelling projects without needing a co-founder or a business partner.
  The technological landscape allowed for such ideas to flourish with minimal resources, demonstrating that individual innovation and capability are paramount in turning concepts into reality.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  And it just so happens that there is a group of upperclassmen at Harvard led by two twins, the Winklevoss twins, who have an idea to digitize Harvard's Facebook and build an online version Of it that they're thinking of calling the Harvard Connection. And they think maybe we could actually take that to other schools, too, and call it ConnectU as sort of the broader version. This was not at all a unique idea. Not at all. Lots of people at lots of schools had this exact same idea. In fact, Harvard itself had this idea. The IT department at Harvard had been promising for years and talking about how they were going to build a digital version of the Harvard Facebook.
  Speaker 1
  And Friendsters out there. And I looked it up. Stanford had Club Nexus. Columbia had CU Community. Yale had Yale Station. I'm sorry. There's a whole movie made about the drama of how novel this idea is. It's not. Totally not. I'm pretty sure Princeton had one, too, when I was there.
  Speaker 2
  Pre-Facebook. Yeah, totally not a novel idea. Lots of people have it. Nope. The Winklevoss twins, though, you know, Mark is now this celebrity on campus. They need somebody to be a programmer to write the site. So they talk to Mark and Mark agrees that he's going to help them out and help code this site that they're thinking about.
  Speaker 1
  Also, again, the chutzpah to say, we have this idea. You are a programmer, you will program our idea. Clearly, Mark can come up with his own ideas that get people excited enough to use the stuff he builds. Now, so far, it's been a little unsavory, but he doesn't have a problem coming up with ideas with product market fit and executing them end to end. The only thing he hasn't done so far is made money, made anything as a business. But what other pieces of the puzzle does he really need from some people with an idea?
  Speaker 2
  None. It's funny. I was going to save this for a little later, but let's talk about it now. In addition to technically because of open source and the LAMP stack and also socially because of AIM and everything going on, the world sort of, for the first time, something like Facebook Being able to be built for no money and no permission. Also, this was the first time that a technical person, because of this, could just do everything.
  Speaker 1
  Like, Mark didn't need anybody. Mark didn't need a non-technical co-founder. Mark didn't need a CEO. He was the CEO. I remember thinking the same thing when I shipped my first app to the App Store. Co-founder Ian and I in 2009, I think, made something called Seize the Day, got over a million downloads. Two programmers uploaded something to the App Store. That's a slightly different era because that's mobile, not web. But I remember looking around being like, whoa, we like didn't need a business guy. Right. That's the craziest thing. You can make stuff and you can put it in the world. Totally.
  Speaker 2
  So this takes us to Harvard's Christmas break. Now, at the time, Harvard did final exams for the fall semester after Christmas break in January. So the idea is all the students go home for Christmas break. You come back in January and then there's a week of reading period where you re-familiarize yourself with all the material from your classes. Then you take final exams. Then there's a little break. ([Time 0:40:40](https://share.snipd.com/snip/219f0f12-d1d4-401d-a9c3-67069065d7bb))
    - **Note:** Ideas are not novel and you don’t need a business expert.
- Authenticity Breeds Engagement
  Summary:
  The success of the platform hinges on the principle of authenticated identities, fostering a sense of trust and exclusivity as users are limited to those within the Harvard community.
  This cultivates an environment where individuals are encouraged to submit their own content, thereby increasing user engagement and participation. Notably, displaying personal information, such as cell phone numbers, enhances connectivity, as users are more likely to share such details with familiar faces.
  The initial launch at Harvard, a prestigious institution, creates a brand halo that appeals to users globally, allowing for easier expansion into other markets.
  Moreover, the dense user base at launch establishes strong norms and vibrant interactions, resulting in a compelling user experience.
  Remarkably, user retention remains high, with approximately 70% of users remaining active daily, showcasing extraordinary engagement levels fueled by the platform's inherent strengths from the outset.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  I don't think status updates were there yet, no. But all the lessons from all the other projects, all the elements of them are coming together here. So once again, registration is limited to email addresses on the harvard.edu domain. That was part of the magic of what had made all the other projects so successful is like, it's not randos in here. It's other people at Harvard. It's your classmates. It's the people you care most about. Yep. And by the nature of that, it's their real identities.
  Speaker 1
  And that's what makes it different than all these other social networks. MySpace existed. Friendster existed. But anyone could sign up for these. And in part, that meant that they had more explosive growth because there was no governor on the growth. And we'll talk about all the problems that sort of come from anyone anywhere can sign up at any time. But the very core thing here is authenticated people. At the start are people you know go to the same college as you and have to use their real name matched against a university-issued email address. Identity, an authentic identity, is a part of the company from its first moment.
  Speaker 2
  Yep. Coupled with super important learning number two from Facemash, it's all user-submitted content. So no pre-population with anything from Harvard, you know, no scraping from Harvard servers, et cetera. And like, yeah, on the one hand that prevents Mark from getting into trouble. On the other hand though, it sets the expectation and the requirement and trains the behaviors of the users of you got to enter all the content into this site yourself. You put in your aim screen name, you put in your cell phone, you put in your interests, you put in your classes.
  Speaker 1
  Also, isn't it crazy that they displayed cell phone numbers for the longest time?
  Speaker 2
  Right. Well, again, think about the functionality and the utility to the users. On the one hand, you would never disclose your cell phone number to the general public. On the other hand, other students and your friends at Harvard knowing your cell phone number, well, that's actually pretty useful for getting in touch, for going out, for going to parties, For planning things, et cetera, et cetera. These are all people you would give your email and phone number and maybe even birthday to if they just asked. Totally. You would probably also give them your relationship status, which is in there. Formalizing your relationship status for the first time here on thefacebook.com. You can add a photo of your own choosing as your profile picture. So big difference from old school Facebooks where it's whatever the university chooses or it's a stock school photo or whatever. No, you get to express your personality. You get to Photoshop it as much as you want. And you can update it whenever you want. And you can update it whenever you want.
  Speaker 1
  So it is amazing how much of the next billion plus people's source of value comes from this founding moment. The Facebook grows tremendously in functionality over time, but everything is like a natural outcropping out of authentic identity, user-submitted content, trust that the people Who are seeing this content are people in your sort of private network. The whole thing is here in this first few weeks of coding that got done and then threw up the landing page.
  Speaker 2
  I would even go one step further than that. The actual nature of the seeding of the network here is maybe the most important thing. And here's what I mean by that. Once Mark launches this, it takes off like wildfire within Harvard. Of course, he's already a celebrity, already known for launching these projects. People are tuned in waiting for the next Mark Zuckerberg production. Within the first 24 hours, 650 people join. There's only 2,000 people in a class at Harvard. So I think there's about 7,000 or 8,000 undergraduates total. Within two weeks, over half of the entire undergraduate population is active on Facebook. So now, here's what I mean and why the seeding is so important. This initial network is super dense, super engaged, and super active. That not only sets the norms for how you're going to behave on Facebook going forward, it also means that as the network grows virally, it radiates out from this like nuclear reactor Of a base. Contrast that with an approach of something like Friendster that's default open to everybody, backed by Silicon Valley venture dollars, trying to grow. They're doing marketing. Okay, let's say somebody in Ohio hears about Friendster somehow. Maybe they see an ad for it. They sign up. When they join the service, there's no friends there. There's nothing to do. There's no functionality. It's not alive. When you join the Facebook, even though it's limited to just Harvard students, you sign up and you're like blown away by how alive this site is. Right.
  Speaker 1
  Almost nobody can use the Facebook, but for the people who can, it's an unbelievably great experience. As they expanded, that stayed true. It was either you're not allowed to use it, or if you are, it's blow away great instantly.
  Speaker 2
  That's basically always true. And the moments when Facebook stops growing is when that's not true. And then they sort of refocus on it. And then that gets the growth back. Yeah. Here's another thing that I think was really important about this seeding of Facebook was actually that it happened at Harvard. Harvard is the top global brand among universities. Whatever you personally think about Harvard, it's undeniable, especially back then, that it was like the top. If you were a kid or a family pretty much anywhere in the world, you knew what Harvard was. This was really important as Facebook expanded because it had this patina to it. It was like elite, especially as they grew. There were clones. There were lots of other Facebook copies out there.
  Speaker 1
  And even if they were as good as what Mark had built, they didn't start at Harvard.
  Speaker 2
  It's kind of like civilization. Nobody else could ever invade Facebook's turf, but they could invade other people's turf. So somebody put it to me in the research, like there was a fairly big competitor in Germany, I think maybe called StudyVice or something like that. Facebook could really easily go into Germany and people in Germany would be like, oh, Facebook, I've heard of that. This is interesting. StudyVice could never go into Boston, like ever.
  Speaker 1
  It's interesting. Yeah, that's a great point. Okay, so like weeks go by and they've saturated Harvard. And not only that, you start seeing this thing happen, which just to level set with listeners, this stayed true for several years. This is a crazy ([Time 0:48:43](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f09d3ad8-b1da-4835-a007-e3b973d6a08d))
    - **Note:** Amazing business with an incredible solution to the cold start problem and amazing network effects. Took all of his learnings put it into Facebook. The crazy way to build and scale a network. This is basically all of Facebook winning counter positioning novel inventions. They went to Columbia because it had the best competitor wanted an acid test. Just crazy. Scaled so well.
- Feed Evolution: From Pull to Push
  Summary:
  The introduction of the news feed represented a groundbreaking shift in social media dynamics, transitioning from a model where users actively sought content (pull) to one where content was actively pushed to them.
  This required complex algorithms to collate updates from users' profiles since their last visit, leading to a new way of engaging with social media. Initial backlash from users was largely due to concerns over privacy and the perceived intrusiveness of sharing information, despite no actual changes in privacy settings.
  The expectation of how social interactions should function was violated, prompting outrage, yet engagement metrics revealed users were captivated by the new format.
  This response highlighted a disconnect between user emotions and actual usage patterns.
  Although Facebook recognized the importance of accommodating user sentiment through controls over visibility, the lesson drawn was that users would adapt to changes, setting a precedent for future features. Additionally, the concurrent launch of open registration allowed broader access to the platform, ultimately altering its user base dynamics, as it removed restrictions that had previously segmented users by school affiliations. The controversies surrounding these changes laid the groundwork for evolving interactions within social media, fundamentally reshaping user expectations and engagement.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  What was a feed on the web? What was sort of an infinite scrolling? They didn't exist. This was the first one. Right. This was the invention of the feed. Like maybe you've got Reddit and Dig and you could sort of make an argument that their feeds, they're paginated rankings of stories. So you could see like, oh, what are the most important stories? But even that's a pretty different fundamental thing. I don't think Reddit had launched yet. Dig maybe exists, but yes, as you said. Oh yeah, Reddit was in the first YC batch, which was 05. So it wasn't really, it was right around the same time. Okay, so how do you make a feed? Well, if you are an algorithms developer, the way you would sort of think of it is, okay, well, first I need to pick a point in time. And from that point in time, and let's call that maybe the last time someone looked at their feed, I need to store that timestamp. And now I need to go look at every single profile of someone that you are connected to. So this is N and download or cache all of their recent updates since that time period. So I need to store that somewhere. I need a new place to store a copy of all of this information that lives on someone's profile, or at least pointers to that on everybody's profile. And I need that to happen for every So now it's N squared. Every single person on the entire Facebook needs to have something running in the background that is looking at every other person on Facebook since a particular time. All needs to happen fast enough such that by the time they want to go check the feed again, it's happened again. And obviously, like now that happens in real time. And I think it was something like every three hours there was like a new batch.
  Speaker 2
  Yeah, it was four times a day when it initially launched. There was like a four X a day refresh. Okay, so every six hours. Yeah, it was a cron job because they didn't have enough memory to run it in real time.
  Speaker 1
  That's right. They needed to happen on separate boxes to run this process, cache the results, and then when you loaded your news feed, go fetch them. So this is like a whole new application using the same data that the company has to build in order to make news feed happen.
  Speaker 2
  And so what you just described is all the technical work just making a feed possible.
  Speaker 1
  On the back end, this doesn't contemplate any of the front end design or engineering or incredible permutations of how to display this data when it does come back, given a massive combinatorial Problem of how might this data come back. Exactly.
  Speaker 2
  Then you need to make the feed actually compelling. Like, I don't really care about, you know, somebody who I'm tangentially connected to what they had for lunch today, but I really care about, like, a photo of Ben at the acquired meetup.
  Speaker 1
  Right. So now you're telling me you want to rank order it by something other than... Chronology. Make another pass and figure out what I think is going to be the most interesting to you, which on its own is an incredibly difficult computer science problem. What is interesting to you? What data should we use to inform that decision? Right.
  Speaker 2
  Totally. Who are your close friends? Who do you care about the most? You know, what general news do you care about the most? What types of stuff do you care about?
  Speaker 1
  Do we have to put weights on every relationship in this entire complex friend graph between every single entity and how close they are and then re-rank that very often? Eventually, yeah. Yes.
  Speaker 2
  So the team spends the better part of 2006 working on this. By September, it's ready. And so by September 5th, 2006, just in time for the new school year, they launch it. And people noticed because they launch it, to everybody right away. And this is a massive paradigm shift.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah.
  Speaker 2
  It's not opt-in or anything. This is Facebook changing the game of social. Not opt-in. Everybody gets it right away. They get 30,000 angry emails to support on the first day from users who are really upset about this. 10% of the entire global user base signs up for a group, a Facebook group called Students Against Facebook News Feed. I'm pretty sure I was part of this group. The irony here is they had only just launched open groups across school networks days or weeks before. So like they enable the tool of their own vitriol here.
  Speaker 1
  And also guess how people are finding out about this group through News Feed. Yes. This is the great irony of the whole situation. There's a literal panic in the streets. There are people protesting outside the office. There is somebody trying to use a crane to get into the third story. Basically, a TV truck is trying to cover what's happening in the pandemonium. And at the same time, despite everyone telling them, I hate this thing. It's the worst thing ever, if you look at the analytics, people love it. People cannot get enough of scrolling through the new news feed. And the reason they're really upset is actually quite interesting. They're saying, oh, it's sharing this with my whole network. Okay, but you updated it on your profile, which has always been public to your whole network. And I think Facebook for the first time kind of stepped in it and realized, oh, even though technically this data has always, you know, we didn't change how public or private it is. It's just as accessible. The ease of obtaining that information or whether it feels like you are pushing that information out versus someone is sort of pulling by going to your profile and viewing.
  Speaker 2
  It went from pull to push. Yes. So it's the start of the new school year. We've just come off this sort of tumultuous summer. Growth had slowed, walked away from the Yahoo deal. There's this revolt in the streets against Newsfeed, which to Mark's mind, along with OpenReg, which was supposed to come like two days later of opening up Facebook to anybody, they Delayed that because of the Newsfeed reaction. But to Mark's mind, the two of these things are like the big growth levers to reignite growth for Facebook. The board, the management team, everybody's like, all right, we got to roll newsfeed back. People hate it. This is PR 101. We apologize. We roll it back. But out of kicker, News Feed actually significantly hurt Facebook's revenue. Because where do you think all the page views were coming from and all the refreshes? Oh, loading a new ad. Yep, loading all the profile views and clicking around. So page views are actually going to go down in this new paradigm. Every reason ([Time 2:10:41](https://share.snipd.com/snip/678c9cc5-890c-466b-87db-d61145baccd2))
    - **Note:** Newsfeed and building new product. Invention of social media. Dealing with issues. They moved so fast.
- Thresholds Shape Growth
  Summary:
  Growth teams emerged as dedicated units focusing on integrating marketing and product efforts to optimize user experience and drive growth.
  Successful growth relies on leveraging product features rather than exclusively external marketing strategies. A data-driven approach allows these teams to identify user engagement metrics and areas for improvement, such as user onboarding and retention.
  Techniques like crowdsource translations enhance product accessibility and foster user ownership, particularly in international markets.
  Key growth levers include prompting new users to connect with existing friends quickly, as this significantly impacts their long-term engagement.
  The early growth team's focus on both user acquisition and retention led to explosive growth rates, transforming user engagement metrics from moderate levels to robust activity. This foundational strategy pioneered the understanding that growth is not merely about adding users but about ensuring those users find value and remain engaged with the product.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  One is it was effectively the first growth team.
  Speaker 2
  Yes. I think it was the first growth team. Yeah.
  Speaker 1
  Everyone who wants to get into growth now, I don't think really fully grasps that is a brand new discipline invented in 2008. And the way they sort of defined it at Facebook was there's marketing, there's product, but marketing and product both touch customers in different ways and so the left hand needs to Talk to the right hand so for example you should not have a marketing team that is sending out emails through an email marketing system and a product team that is sending out notifications To users through the product with no notion of how they're speaking to each other you should a unify those efforts through one team and B, that team should live within product, or at least That team should be tightly coupled to product with the general belief or reason for being that your product is the best lever to grow. No amount of marketing you could ever throw at something that is not integrated into your product will be as effective as your product doing a good job with features, hitting the right Users with the right message and the right value at the right time in a native way to the core feature set of the product. Got Shamath, you've got Alex Schultz, you've got Naomi Gleit and Javier Olivan. And so you've got this core early team. It's four people, and then it expands to kind of six or seven folks that are formed really on this agreement between Shamath and Mark of we are going to have this dedicated growth team, And our mission is going to be to grow Facebook using Facebook itself, not through extrinsic measures.
  Speaker 2
  Yep. And this was like an incredible insight and was so perfect for Facebook because like, I think this growth insight of growth through product can apply to any company, but it especially Applies to a virally growing social network like Facebook? Yes.
  Speaker 1
  There's these interesting things that make it tick. The first of which is this has to be the most data-obsessed team in the company. Every team should be data-obsessed, blah, blah, blah. But the growth team is really the one who sort of discovers, oh, here are the obvious places where users are deriving value. Here are the obvious places where users are getting confused. Here are the obvious opportunities to find new users. Here are the obvious opportunities to reduce friction. Analytics is the answer for that. And I think that there's a lot of really interesting stories, especially around internationalization of the growth team and partnering with other product teams around the company To say, what is an engineering and product approach to something that traditionally has been done other ways? Like the way most people would translate their product is by hiring translation servicing firms or by hiring a dedicated person to go through string by string and edit. Well, we're Facebook. We have all these users. What if we just, you know, when we're launching in Spain, surface different words to Spanish speakers and say, okay, is this the right word for Spanish or not? Hey, can you translate this and crowdsource it and double check it with everyone? And that way you can not just translate five or 10 of the top languages in the world. You can be in every language all the time up to date using Facebook itself. Because, oh, by the way, when you translate the product, way more people can use it. And so translation itself, internationalization is a growth lever. And we have product ways to do the translation with our users.
  Speaker 2
  Yep. And that's what actually started even before the official growth team with Javi in that first hackathon. Yes. But that was the seed of this idea of like, oh, actually the way to get past this growth wall, as people refer to it in retrospect that we're hitting, is use the product itself. And internationalization, there's even more to it than what you said. One, when you have the users themselves who are translating a product as you're seeding it in these new markets, they're so much more bought in and like feel a sense of ownership over It versus like, oh, I'm just airdropping this, you know, translated American product onto your country here. So it's not just that it's a better translation. It's that like you're actually seeding those first power users who are going to be deeply engaged and feel ownership over the product. And then two, the nuance in like the local markets that might even be in the same language. I mean, Spanish the perfect example. Spanish is spoken in so many places around the world, but like the local nuances and needs in Spain are like super different than Mexico or Argentina or Latin America, et cetera. That's exactly right.
  Speaker 1
  And I think my point with all this is a growth is a pretty new discipline in our industry to growth is not marketing. It's very tempting. You see, especially with incumbents like big Fortune 500 companies who have someone whose title is growth, and then you ask them what they do, and you're like, oh, no, that's not growth. That's marketing. You don't actually modify the product at all. So that's a different thing. And it's important to realize, like, not only did Facebook kind of invent the discipline, they are perhaps still the best at it. They really eat, sleep, and breathe the idea that growth comes from product. Yep.
  Speaker 2
  It was that core initial team, all of them, of which Javi. Javi's now the COO. Alex. Alex is now the CMO of Meta. Naomi. Naomi is now Meta's longest tenured employee besides Mark and runs a ton of stuff at the company. And Chamath, who deserves so much credit for starting the team, pulling it together, protecting it, advocating for it within the rest of product in the way that only Chamath can.
  Speaker 1
  Man, it really is crazy, the Facebook diaspora. We're going to keep seeing this as we go along. There's other names where people will be like, whoa, I didn't realize they were at Facebook. But many of the names that have come up so far, yeah, the diaspora is pretty talented. Yeah.
  Speaker 2
  So there were a million things that growth did over the years within the blue app and then ultimately within all the apps at Facebook. Growth today is a core center of excellence discipline that spreads across all the products at the company at Meta. But the other big thing in the early days besides internationalization is people you may know, which crazy, like the carousel of people you may know on Facebook is still a core part of The blue app to this day.
  Speaker 1
  Dude, I just got lost in it. Did you know that that's what I was looking at right now? No. I was sanity checking. I was like, oh, is that person part of the original growth team? And I opened Facebook. The newsfeed distracted me. I scrolled down, there were stories at the top. I scrolled down one post below that first post was an ad below that is people you may know. And I am like three panels over in people you may know. Cause I was like, Oh my gosh, I'm not friends with them. We're doing a podcast tog... ([Time 2:59:55](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3105beb9-64bc-4d3c-baee-eb24fbd114e4))
    - **Note:** Facebook invents this growth team that just understands analytics so well and they bring hard data into the company which was something only they could do. Didn’t outsource and this led to so much growth. Product led growth invention. Test things.
- Navigating Uncertainty: A Cautionary Shift
  Summary:
  The significant transition to mobile presents a genuine existential threat to Facebook, marking an unprecedented challenge since its inception.
  This shift could lead to difficult years ahead for the company, coinciding with its initial public offering (IPO). Despite having a culture that encourages rapid innovation, exemplified by the motto 'move fast and break things', Facebook historically maintained operational stability.
  This reliability stems from extensive investment in internal engineering tools, underscoring the importance of strategic resource allocation in facing unpredictable market dynamics.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Yep, totally. Okay, those are my short list of five reasons of why the shift to mobile is dangerous to Facebook. Anything else you would add?
  Speaker 1
  No. So they're going public right into this. For the first time since our business is founded, we face a real existential threat completely out of our control that is going to make the next few years look really bad.
  Speaker 2
  Let's go public. Yeah. Well, let's talk about that IPO.
  Speaker 1
  Yes. But first, it is time to talk about one of our favorite companies, Statsig. A phrase that many of you will know from Facebook's early days is move fast and break things. But despite instilling this in Facebook's engineering culture, Facebook didn't actually break very often. And it essentially never goes down now. How?
  Speaker 2
  Well, Facebook invested hundreds of thousands of engineering hours in a set of internal tools. ([Time 3:27:07](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1d7361c4-a09a-484d-b922-2d7d7be98b79))
    - **Note:** Mobile almost killed Facebook they went from the open web to closed platforms and couldn’t monetize they says it in their s-1 that mobile was fucking them. They couldn’t be a platform they needed the open web. They could no longer move fast and break things. Mark bought insta over a weekend.
- Commitment Meets Circumstance
  Summary:
  Losing 50% of a company's value, especially post-IPO, often leads to a death spiral with little chance for recovery.
  Investor concerns about transitioning from desktop to mobile revenues can undermine a company's valuation if no growth replacement is visible. Founder control plays a critical role in this scenario; a CEO with a long-term vision can endure immediate setbacks if they maintain majority ownership.
  Strategic decisions require unwavering commitment, exemplified by a commitment to prioritize mobile over desktop advertising, which necessitates risking short-term revenue for long-term gains.
  This approach fosters innovation as the entire focus shifts to creating succinct and effective mobile ad units that engage users deeply.
  Such strategies rely on a strong belief in the future potential of a transformed business model. The shift proved successful, yielding higher ad values in a mobile-centric marketplace due to increased user engagement. This scenario underscores that necessity drives exceptional creativity and results, illustrating the importance of strategic risk-taking and commitment within founder-controlled companies.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  I mean, losing 50% of your value as any company, public or private, but especially a public company is a disaster of epic proportions. Having that happen immediately following your IPO, for most companies, there's no way to come back from that. You're entering a death spiral, you're going to end up being acquired or, you know, you're just going to get driven to zero, basically. Yep. And just to be super clear, desktop revenue wasn't good to go to zero immediately. But Wall Street investors are really worried that like, hey, the world is transitioning to mobile. Eventually growth will start slowing and it will start declining, which it does fairly quickly here. And so like, if you can't show me that you're going to replace that with mobile revenue, why should I value your stock at anything?
  Speaker 1
  Yep. And so here is where founder control matters. This is, David, it's interesting you're explaining the mechanics of a death spiral. That would presume there's a board of directors who feels a strong desire to do whatever is best in the interest of the shareholder, and they might think that it's these short-term things. But if you have a CEO who has a 20-year view and believes deep, deep in his heart that the best is yet to come, and that this is just a temporary problem, and that person controls the company And owns the majority of voting shares, you can withstand things like this. You just better be right.
  Speaker 2
  Yes.
  Speaker 1
  So a little fun anecdote for everyone. David and I, among the 20 other people we talked to to prep for this episode, one of them was Sheryl Sandberg. And we were asking Sheryl, in particular, how did you start the monetization effort on mobile? They were in the third column. There's no third column on mobile. What did you do? And her comment to us was, oh, we just stopped caring about the right side ads on desktop. And we took every engineering resource we could off of that, and we put it on mobile. And we knew we were going to miss the current quarter. I think they missed a lot of quarters right after their IPO. But this was us trading the present for the future. And all we cared about was our future. And she said this great quote.
  Speaker 2
  This is up there with one of the best quotes on Acquired of all time.
  Speaker 1
  She was sitting there with Mark late at night. And when they sort of arrived at this plan of we are going to forego a lot of desktop revenue to basically bet it all on figuring out mobile revenue, she said, well, Mark, nobody can fire You and only you can fire me. So if you're in, I'm in. And we buckled our seatbelt and we said, here we go. And it's amazing. I mean, that can only happen in a founder controlled company. And it really did force them to figure out mobile advertising. If they really are saying, like, this is the new first-class product, this is where we're going to point all advertisers toward, if they're wrong on that, they're wrong across the whole Board. Because if ads suck on mobile, since it's the only thing and it's filling up your whole screen, user engagement is also going to nosedive. And so it's basically a bet-it moment where the ads are front and center, so they must be good. It is essential for the mobile product and thus your company for them to be good. Users' attention will be pointed at these ads like no other ads you have ever run before. And actually, the flip side of this is it ended up being the best thing ever for the company. Because the ads are front and center, the value per ad is actually higher. So they ended up creating a much, much more valuable ad unit than they ever had on desktop purely because of this incredible attention on them when you're scrolling in feed on mobile. Necessity is the absolute mother of invention.
  Speaker 2
  Yes, totally. You have no choice but to do your best work. And boy, did it work out fabulously. Yeah. Ben, nobody can fire you. Well, I guess you can't fire me either.
  Speaker 1
  But either way, if you're in, I'm in. The corporate structure to acquire is still a little, it's unclear.
  Speaker 2
  But yes, totally. So when we say taking your best, most trusted engineers, taking them off whatever they're doing and putting them on ads, there's actually an amazing story around this. So Mark goes to someone within the company who he knows can just ship and get stuff done. And that is Boz, Andrew Bosworth, his old TA from Harvard. Boz at this point is running the core profile and timeline within Facebook. And Mark goes and talks to him and says, Boz, I think you should come work on ads. To which Boz replies, okay, I mean, like, I get we're in this situation, but you know, Mark, like, I can't do this for too long. Because remember, I'm getting married this fall. And I've got this six-month sabbatical plan for my honeymoon. And my wife and I, we're going to travel the world. It's all, like, booked and paid for. We're going to be out of the country. And Mark is like, yes. Well, we've got a few months until then. I think you should come over and work on ads. I was like, okay, okay. I will do that. I will come up with something here before the wedding. So he teams up with Will Cathcart from the Newsfeed team, from Chris Cox's team. And they go get to work. By the way, Will is the head of WhatsApp today. And Boz, of course, is the CTO of Meta and head of Reality Labs. Yep. And the first thing they do during these couple months is like, all right, we just need like a Band-Aid to stop the bleeding and at least produce some mobile revenue. ([Time 3:44:16](https://share.snipd.com/snip/79ad54ad-98e7-4e1c-84d3-c7ddba0df542))

- Embrace More for Greater Relevance
  Summary:
  Innovative advertising strategy posits that an increase in ads can enhance user experience and engagement by delivering targeted content.
  A vast, liquid marketplace with extensive data allows for precision in advertising, transforming ads into valuable content rather than a nuisance. This approach argues that users benefit from relevant advertisements that cater to their needs, leading to higher engagement levels.
  Historical evidence showcases that effective mobile monetization not only averted potential decline but also established a novel, user-friendly ad format, redefining the landscape of digital advertising for sustained growth.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  This is the most interesting thing. At this point in history, Mark is putting pressure on Boz and Cheryl to show fewer ads. Yes. And Boz is the one with the contrarian view who comes to Mark and says, we're thinking about this all wrong. We actually need way more ads. Not just a little more ads, huge amounts more ads. Because a great ad is on par with content. And if you have tons and tons of ads, then we can do way better targeting. Like you have this beautiful liquid marketplace of hundreds of thousands of advertisers, billions of users, and at any given time, somebody can see the optimal ad for them and get recommended An amazing product that perfectly fits their needs in that moment with messaging that's perfectly tailored for them. Great advertising can be great, but you need a really, really liquid marketplace and you need fantastic algorithms, which you can only have if you train them on tons and tons of data. So like we actually need 10,000 times more ads than we have right now, not less. It's almost like the only way out is through. We're going down this path. We must be extremely successful in order to be successful at all.
  Speaker 2
  This was such a contrarian view and also right. And I think only could have come from someone like Boz being focused on this problem because as a product person and an engineer, it's the only way that you're going to have that insight That like, oh, this is the same problem we had when we launched News Feed. The way to fix News Feed and to make it really, really awesome is more News Feed, you know, is more data, right? The only way out is through. Yeah. If somebody had purely come, I think from the advertising world, they would have been like, well, you know, that's just the nature of advertising, right? It's a tax on the users. And that's the way monetization of media works. But like, boss was like, no, no, no, actually, this is a relevance problem. And we can make this awesome. And in order to make it awesome, we need a lot more of it. Yep.
  Speaker 1
  And basically, like, that's what happened. I mean, flash forward 10 years, I opened Instagram to get great product recommendations. Totally.
  Speaker 2
  It's actually kind of wild. I believe this is true. There are markets in the world today where I think Meta has run this test, where if you turn off ads in the, you know, Meta family of apps products, engagement in those products actually Goes down, which is just like freaking wild. You would think like, oh, wow, now I get to use meta products without advertising. No tax on me. I'm going to engage more. No, it goes down.
  Speaker 1
  That's the definition of ads as content, if that's actually the case.
  Speaker 2
  Totally wild. So by the fourth quarter of 2013, which honestly in the scheme of things is pretty freaking fast, the whole thing finally flips. Facebook announces that mobile advertising is now 53% of revenue and total ad revenue for the company grew 76% year over year in the fourth quarter, which of course is the most important Quarter of the year, which means I did all the math on that. That means that all of desktop revenue, all of it. So the old platform business, the old ad business, the Microsoft third party ad serving, all of that actually shrank in the fourth quarter of 2013. So that's the counterfactual here. If Facebook had not gotten mobile monetization right, that's what would have happened is Q4 2013, all of the growth momentum that it had would have flipped and it would have started The downward spiral.
  Speaker 1
  And probably not that early if...
  Speaker 2
  I guess that's right because all the resources got pulled off of it.
  Speaker 1
  Exactly. But that's what would have happened eventually to it.
  Speaker 2
  Eventually. Yep. Yep. So, man, it's like this wild 18-month journey, but it totally saved the company because now here they are. They've built this unique, pioneering, and totally defensible native mobile ad unit in the feed. They define the whole generation of monetization here.
  Speaker 1
  It's the best ad unit in history. It's an ad that completely fills the screen on your device and that users are okay with. ([Time 3:55:01](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b831eacf-9ba3-44e6-8811-0617c99b0398))
    - **Note:** Unique problem solving. The solution to Facebook ad problem was more adds even though the ads were bad they needed more reps. Now their ad product is so good it increases monetization the solution to horse shit was cars. The solution to global warming is expending more energy. Whenever they decide to do something the hire the best people and go all in but requires a mindset shift first.
- From Town Square to Living Room: A Shift in Social Dynamics
  Summary:
  The transition of social interactions from public platforms, like town squares, to more private environments, such as living rooms, enables the separation of media from social engagement.
  Users can now experience social content, such as videos from services like TikTok, within their established digital habits and share these experiences privately with close friends through messaging apps. This evolution marks a significant change in user behavior, where public content can spark intimate discussions in private settings.
  Additionally, the organizational structure between companies like ByteDance and Meta presents a stark contrast; ByteDance operates as an AI-centric enterprise leveraging TikTok as a product vector, while Meta has transitioned to a more decentralized model with centers of excellence focusing on shared resources across the company.
  This distinction illustrates a broader need to adapt our language and understanding of social media as traditional definitions become outdated.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Mark correctly identified of social shifting from the town square to the living room. This is a second order effect of that shift that the company didn't see coming. Because once you shift social from the town square to the living room, it now becomes possible to divorce media from social. You're already getting your social now in private in your digital living room. The town square can become something that is completely not social. Right.
  Speaker 1
  It's turned into this pretty interesting dual pronged approach that they now have, which is you open Instagram and you have reels. So the job to be done by TikTok is now done by a thing that you already have habit around. It's bundled into the place where you actually consume your social media. Great. That's step one. Step two is this is where it's nice to have WhatsApp. This is where it's nice to have Messenger. For these living room style conversations with just a few of your friends, the new user behavior is I see a thing that got millions of views. I can think of one or five people to share that with. And then I have a private conversation about this public object in private.
  Speaker 2
  I will share that on WhatsApp, or I will share that on iMessage, or I will share that on, you know, whatever my actual friend living room network of choice is.
  Speaker 1
  And ending up now in this reasonably complex interaction paradigm of I get AI served videos from people I don't know tailored to me. And then I privately share those in multiple groups with those who I love and care about.
  Speaker 2
  That is a huge evolution.
  Speaker 1
  It's crazy that we use the term social network or social media for these two things that are like light years apart.
  Speaker 2
  Totally. The social and the media is now completely divorced. And that is because of the shift from town square to living room.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, we really need to evolve our language around all this stuff.
  Speaker 2
  Okay, so that I think is dimension one that TikTok is completely orthogonal to Facebook. Dimension two is actually organizationally. So TikTok, as we chronicled on our episode about it a couple of years ago, came out of ByteDance. Well, it was an acquisition of Musical.ly by ByteDance and then ByteDance turned it into TikTok. ByteDance had Totiao before having TikTok. ByteDance is an AI company. ByteDance is not a product company. And the core product that ByteDance makes is its AI, along with all sorts of other stuff. TikTok is like the product vector, one of many and the biggest, by which they deploy their actual product, which is AI. This is very, very different from Facebook, which has always been a product company. And so like organizationally, the way ByteDance is set up is there are these centers of excellence within the company where the algorithms, the AI that is controlled by a centralized Team within the company. At least that's my perception of how they're different organizationally from how Facebook used to be. Facebook and Facebook leadership was obviously watching this very, very closely. And if you look at how Meta is organized now, it looks a hell of a lot more like that. So Meta today is organized. There are centers of excellence across the company. Same way that I was just talking about ByteDance. There's FAIR, that's the fundamental AI research team. There's infrastructure shared across the whole company, deployed to all the products and apps. There's revenue and monetization shared across the whole company, deployed to all the products and apps. There's growth shared across the whole company, deployed across the various products and apps. There's integrity and safety, which is a big, big, big advantage that Facebook has. They've reorganized how the whole company looks. There's still all the individual products in the family of apps. Those all have their own heads, and they all roll up to Chris Cox, who has had a product for the whole company and AI too, actually reports to him. But all the infrastructure, all the revenue, all the growth, all the integrity and safety are decoupled from those actual products now and live in these centers of excellence across The company.
  Speaker 1
  Fascinating. ([Time 4:24:07](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f2279a27-e2c2-4a44-a679-486fde729b0d))
    - **Note:** Social media splitting into social and media and why they found meta as a holding company
- Mastering Uncertainty through Strategic Investments
  Summary:
  Advertisers generally pay a fixed amount irrespective of expenses related to AI model providers, making it crucial for companies to minimize these costs to maximize profits.
  Meta's unique approach involves taking on significant risks and investing heavily to control essential technologies, thereby avoiding dependency on external vendors and maintaining competitive leverage. This strategy reflects a desire to dictate product development and secure financial gains by controlling technology.
  Meta exemplifies the principle of commoditizing complements, demonstrating a pattern of placing multiple strategic bets to ensure flexibility and options in uncertain environments, akin to Bill Gates’ methodology.
  Through iterative product development and talent acquisition focused on high intelligence, Meta strategically fortifies its position by developing parallel initiatives while also acquiring successful platforms, reducing reliance on singular solutions and enhancing their market adaptability.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Yes. Or an advertiser is not going to pay you more or less depending on how much you have to pay the AI model provider. They're going to pay you an amount. And if you want to maximize the amount of that you get to keep, it behooves you for you to not have to pay as much money to AI model providers. Yes. Better put. Okay, so how does this apply to Playbook? Well, Meta seems to like taking all the risk in situations like this, putting lots of dollars in so they can take more of the reward. You could imagine a more moderate company saying, oh, well, there's going to be lots of AI vendors out there, and we could just let them take care of that as their core competency, and We'll just buy off the shelf from them. But that's not how Meta works, especially with everything they've been through with Apple. They have gotten true religion, and I think always kind of wanted to be in this position, and they just have the capital to do it now. They will control the key technologies that matter to them, both for getting to own and dictate product roadmaps and products decisions, but also for the financial upside of making Sure that they control their own destiny and no one in the ecosystem has extreme leverage over them.
  Speaker 2
  Right. Only a company of the scale of meta can kind of run this playbook, playbook in quotes, because no startup is going to be like, oh, okay, what is my strategy to make sure that open AI and Anthropic Don't get leverage over me? Good luck with that.
  Speaker 1
  Yep, totally. So my first big playbook theme is meta discovers commoditize your compliment and is now looking for ways to use it everywhere. I love it. Well put. Okay, great.
  Speaker 2
  I think my first one is almost a different way of putting that, which is really like Mark and specifically his superpower of placing multiple bets on multiple chess boards, never wanting To be backed into a corner. Yeah. And I think he has done incredibly well. And I think the story of Meta shows all throughout, even in the very, very beginning as a tiny project, not even a startup where degrees of freedom were limited. He was always making choices and playing the game such that there are multiple options of how things could go right.
  Speaker 1
  Totally. Mark is a master at maximizing his degrees of freedom and setting up the board such that in an uncertain future, there are multiple paths to victory no matter how the world unfolds.
  Speaker 2
  Yep.
  Speaker 1
  Which is unbelievably Gatesian. I feel like we said the exact same line about Bill Gates in our Microsoft episodes. The real comp for this company is Microsoft. I think that's right. That was actually my next one. They do iterative product development. They put the first version out just to kind of get feedback and see how they need to rev it and get better for the future. The early days are characterized by hiring all the smartest people and prioritizing IQ over everything else, commoditizing your compliment, obsession with building a platform That other developers build on top of, this whole thing about multiple bets and an uncertain future. I mean, it's funny that just look at they were building Messenger internally, they bought WhatsApp, I bet they're glad that they had that dual prong strategy. They were developing an app called Photos at the same time that they bought Instagram. That's what they do. It's Gatesian. ([Time 5:49:03](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5e9df345-96a4-4827-98b6-18ed1c312c87))
    - **Note:** Always maintaining optionality. Dominanating the market. Control as much as possible.
- Founders set the tone for success
  Summary:
  Founders significantly influence the culture and operation of their companies, often acting as the driving force behind success.
  The alignment of a founder's characteristics—intelligence, humility in decision-making, openness to truth, competitiveness, and deep product understanding—is crucial when they hold control over the company. However, the relationship between founder control and sound decision-making is complex and influenced by factors like timing, luck, and uncontrollable circumstances, suggesting that the success stories of companies often reflect extreme outliers in human traits.
  Additionally, a durable executive team comprised of longstanding members fosters unity and coherence in vision and strategy.
  Companies like Meta exemplify adaptability, responding fluidly to market challenges and evolving threats, which differentiates them from competitors that adhere rigidly to a single vision.
  Rather than a fixed strategy, successful companies leverage diverse approaches, including acquisition, imitation, and innovation to thrive. This fluidity allows them to pivot as needed, enhancing their ability to meet changing market dynamics and consumer needs.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  In the same vein, it is painfully obvious when you look at this company that companies are just founders extended. The culture of this company is just Mark, and it's a huge lever for Mark to act. This has been true over and over again, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Nike. It's just how great companies are in the world. It's very hard for me to point to a truly great company where the DNA isn't like a lever on the founder's personality.
  Speaker 2
  I think that is right. And I think it is doubly so with Meta because of Sean Parker and because it was set up from the very, very beginning that nobody could ever get rid of Mark, that it was always going to be his Decision.
  Speaker 1
  And there's got to be a lot of companies out there that like we're looking at the success case.
  Speaker 2
  Yeah, this works if the founder is really, really, really smart and right almost all of the time. Right.
  Speaker 1
  As we talk to people, here are the traits that we heard over and over again. Mark is a genius, a really good listener, a fast learner. He goes from knowing zero to mastery in months or years. He has low ego about being right. That's not to say that he has a low ego, but he has a low ego about being right. He is obsessed with finding truth and open to being wrong. He's intensely competitive. He's relentless. He's actually a very good product designer and understanding the computer architecture that will be required to accomplish such a product experience at scale. I mean, all these things, like if you have these characteristics and you're then empowered to singularly control the company at massive scale, yeah, it's going to go well. But the first thing is actually much harder than the second thing. Yes, yes.
  Speaker 2
  It's not a causal relationship here that having founder control will lead to the right decisions.
  Speaker 1
  Right. This is my regular reminder that in studying these episodes with extreme survivorship bias, we are looking at the most extreme outliers who, in every dimension you can multiply by, They're at the edge of the distribution. Mark is, I don't know, six or seven standard deviations from the mean human across the important traits that mattered to making Facebook. Oh, and by the way, with the right timing and the right luck and the right circumstance and the right know-how, my biggest lesson from doing an acquired is these things are unrecreatable. I agree.
  Speaker 2
  All right, what's your next one?
  Speaker 1
  Durable executive team. It's kind of shocking how many of the people that are Mark's direct reports and their directs have just been there for a really long time. This team knows how to work together.
  Speaker 2
  Oh, yes. I was actually talking about this with one of the execs at Meta the other day. And he brought this up and was saying that, like, this really feels like something very, very unique to Meta. And I thought about it for a minute and I was like, actually, no, I think this is something that is unique to all great companies. If you look across the landscape out there, Apple certainly like this. If you look at Nvidia, if you look at Apple, if you look at, you know, Microsoft in recent years, if you look at the original Microsoft, Costco, you look at Costco, like this is almost always True, really is true in every great company that I can think of. The core senior most executive team are all people who came up in the company or have been there for a very, very long time. It's not a whole bunch of mercenaries there at the top.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, that's interesting. Okay, that brings me to this next one, which is something we talked a little bit about with Mark on stage. And I'm curious to hear your answer to this now that we've had all this time and space to think about it. Here are all the battles where Meta has either won by buying the company, won by beating the company, won by copying, or gotten to some kind of sustainable stalemate. MySpace and Friendster, Google +, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp. We didn't talk about this one, but Meerkat and Periscope. Oh, yeah. They launched Facebook Live when that was supposed to be the next big thing. Yep. Snapchat and TikTok. That's like seven, eight. Why do they keep winning?
  Speaker 2
  I have some thoughts. It's funny. As we were preparing to interview Mark at Chase Center last month, this was the question that we kept asking people. In some ways, I think it's a little bit of a Rorschach test. Everybody's answer was different, and it was always like what they think is the most important thing. I think my answer for this is going to be a version of Mark as the answer. Yeah. And it kind of goes back to Adam D'Angelo's Friendster testimonial about him being way too lucky and then realizing it's not luck at all. And I think it is that, you know, as Adam was telling to me as he's reflected on this, it's a very specific way of carrying yourself through the world where you don't hold too tightly to The path you're on. Obviously, Mark is incredibly driven to the goal of connecting all the people in the world and doing that through meta. But he's very, very open and flexible to the exact path that it's going to take to get there. And that combination, I think, has led over and over and over again to these threats emerging. And Mark and the whole team there at Meta saying like, okay, what is the way that we can neutralize this threat or defeat it? And we are open to anything on that front.
  Speaker 1
  Open to being whatever they need to be to make that happen. I think Meta might look extremely different 20 years from now than it is today, almost like unrecognizably, because this company moves like water in response to whatever the new shape Of the world is.
  Speaker 2
  I mean, hell, after trying Orion, I think there's a very plausible reality five years from now where this company looks very, very different than it does today.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah. I mean, it really is this idea. Meta is a technology company through and through, and then they leverage that technology to be whatever the hell they need to be to adapt to the new world.
  Speaker 2
  Which is so different from all of the other big technology companies out there. They are all wedded to a particular vision of what they are.
  Speaker 1
  Totally, because these are all different strengths. Like, they aren't afraid of copying. Okay, that is a strength. But that's also a completely different thing than I'm going to place bets on what I think is going to be the big technology wave of the future and spend tens of billions of dollars on that. That's a different way of winning. Or in some cases, I'm going to try to leverage my existing network effect to make sure I adopt someone else's social mechanic.
