Also some goals you need to evaluate daily some yearly have the right goal feedback loops. There is no substitute for the work even when you don’t want to.

- Building Habits and Finding Meaning
  Summary:
  Overcoming depression involves developing better habits and perspectives on life, focusing on internal validation, and understanding the importance of routines, even in dark times.
  Money does not buy meaning; rather, finding purpose beyond material possessions leads to lasting fulfillment. Success, whether in career or personal growth, stems from consistent effort and resilience, not external validation or artificial timelines.
  Life is a constant negotiation with oneself, requiring continual self-assessment and adaptation to find ongoing meaning and success.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Oh, yeah. I was really depressed. Like, like I went through, you know, I don't, I don't talk about this often, but I was, I was in a really bad spot. And it was a weird thing. Like I felt guilty about it because like, wow, what right do I have to be depressed? I just, I lived, I just had the dream that everybody plays for, which is an exit in, in a major company and financial independence. But I was, I was very upset. I had some health issues and it's hard to know whether the health issues were from the, from the depression or the stress of building it or, or just, you know, what came first, the health Issues of the depression. But no, I had to, I had to develop better habits in my lifestyle. I had to develop a better perspective on life. There was a lot of stress. There was a fair amount of internal fighting in the company between my original partners, the private equity group. It wasn't an environment where everyone was just focused on the customer and adding value for the customer. And there was, there was a bit too much internal conflict, which is one of the reasons I felt it was time for me to move on. And I think I never had a chance to process all that and, and deal with that. And, and I had to really understand when it no longer becomes about the money, you really have to think about what you're doing and why you're doing it. You take away that factor that it allows you to drown out all the other things in life that are, that are really important, like meaning and, and being able to, to really appreciate the Journey. And, and I didn't really understand those pieces of my life early on. It just became a singular focus where, how can I build this and make money?
  Speaker 2
  What would you say to somebody who's depressed right now?
  Speaker 1
  There is no shortcut for the work period. There's no magic pill. There's no magic elixir. It's about habits. You have to do things even when you don't want to do them. I don't know where I heard this story, but I think it was a guy who had survived the internment camps during the war and where they were being tortured. And, and he said that it was the people who lost hope that that didn't make it. It was the people that had hope, but not expectations that did, right? So they knew they'd get out of there, but they didn't have an expectation on when. And I think depression is, is like that as well. You, you have to get up and go for that run, even though you don't want to do that 20 minutes sit, a, a, you know, breathing exercise, even though you don't want to work on your eating habits Or your, your, your, you know, your, your rituals, whatever they may be. I mean, and it's all kinds of different rituals in your life. It's important. I'm using the word ritual loosely here. It routines habits, whatever you want to call them. When you're in a dark place, they're even more important. I mean, it's really easy when you've had 10 hours of sleep and, and it, the sun is shining and it's, and it's warm outside. It's really easy to go for that run or, or, or put on that smile or whatever it is. Like, you know, that's, that's where it's easy. Where it's hard is it's when it, you know, you had six hours of sleep and you're not feeling great and you're feeling sluggish and, and that's actually when you need to do it. The doing is what matters and it's like life, life just is like that. And I, I wrote that from my father, you know, I mean, he, he got up early and stayed late and put in the work and there is no substitute for the work. I don't know how smart you are. You have to put in the work.
  Speaker 2
  It's so interesting because the parallels between sort of depression and being successful at your job, your career, life, they map each other, right? Which is like, you have to do it when you don't feel like it. Yes. And that's when it matters the most. And you sort of have to have that will because everybody loses the battle with willpower through teens, the rituals they carry you through when you don't feel like doing it. It's like, I don't feel like going on the peloton today, but I do it every day. So I have to get on and go and make every day day one.
  Speaker 1
  You know, we have a habit of beating ourselves up, right? Like the idea of being compassionate with yourself is really important. You miss a day. So what? Like in meditation, it's, it's, you know, come back to the breath, come back to the breath and you call rabbit holes. You go down a rabbit hole where you have these almost like blackout moments where your mind just carries you in a thought. And when you first start meditating, most people when they first start meditating, they do the same thing. They sit down for 20 minutes, but don't do that. Sit down for like three minutes or four minutes or five minutes. Like build up, right? You're building a muscle. You're building that, that focus muscle. But when we have these sort of blackout moments in meditation, where our mind wanders and we don't even know where it goes. And then all of a sudden we come back and we're like, Oh, yeah, I wasn't focused on my breathing or whatever visceral exercise I had. We have a tendency to beat ourselves up. You're like, Oh, I can't believe I could, you know, you do it mentally and we're human. You're going to make mistakes. Like you don't have to always get it right. You're allowed to slip up, but just keep restarting. There is no moment in life where everything's just perfect. Like life is dynamic. It's not static, right? It's, it's you're always renegotiating with yourself and it is an ever-changing thing. And I think it's just how do you work on, on bringing the right attitudes into it each and every day?
  Speaker 2
  I want to go back to 2016. You get this fairly big payday. Yeah. What are the lessons that you wish you knew then about money that you know now?
  Speaker 1
  First of all, money doesn't buy meaning. Number one, you have to, money can help facilitate a lot of things, but you, you have to know who you are and what you want. That's really, really important and that has nothing to do with money. Buying nice things is going to be fleeting. I think we all know this intuitively and yet so many people do this. And I'm not saying don't buy nice things. It's always nice to buy nice things, but it's important to understand that in and of itself is not going to give you meaning, a really nice car, a nice watch or a nice house or whatever. It's going to be cool for a minute, but eventually it's going to go away. I think I once heard this from a friend, you know, the secret to life is something to do, someone to love and something to look forward to. Money can help facilitate parts of that, especially the something to look forward to. But, but you have to tap in the deeper meaning on, on what it is, what gets you excited on an ongoing basis. For me, it's building businesses. But I wish coming out of that experience of making money and becoming financially independent. I wish I'd taken a little bit more time to think about how I wanted to do that and where I wanted to do that. I think I was a bit too, I felt I needed to get back in the game very quickly. I think I I I I said an artificial timeline. Like, I think sometimes we set these artificial timelines with ourselves. And it's already, at least in my case, it was my ego. I felt I had to be back in or I was going to be a one hit wonder, you know, and and, I mean, all that's BS. I mean, there is no one way. There is no one story. I'm now in my my early 40s and we love telling ourselves... ([Time 0:47:33](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ccb4ad59-ebd6-4a98-a76a-6ebf17bff6b3))

    - **Note:** Don’t believe in fake timelines. Getting through everything including depression is a constant practice and process. Life is a process. Do things when you don’t want failure is inevitable but when you fail get up dust yourself off and get back at it that’s the beauty of life.
- Simplicity and Patience in Investment
  Summary:
  Warren Buffett's key lessons are making decisions with conviction, having the ability to overcome the action bias, seeking internal validation rather than caring about others' opinions, playing the long game, expressing complex ideas in simple terms, and demonstrating an exceptional level of patience in investing by making very few decisions but holding onto them for the long term.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  You mentioned Warren Buffett. I know you're a fan. What are some of the lessons you've taken away from him over the years?
  Speaker 1
  The first one is I wish I had this this superpower. Here's a guy who can make very few decisions, but make them with so much conviction and then live in Omaha, Nebraska and like go sit in a fishing boat while the world goes on around him. I mean, you know, talk about being able to overcome the action bias. I just think that's incredible. I mean, a lot of things we're talking about here today where how do you get to a place where you have internal validation and you kind of don't care what others think? I mean, very few of us can say that that we don't care about what others think. I think he's one of them. He really is one of them. I first read about Warren Buffett at the start of David's tea. I was telling you the story. I think it was Buffetology, actually, I think his daughter in law. So that was, I mean, we're going back now 20 years, right? And since that time, I've seen him go through waves where the world thought he was a dinosaur, right? Like when he bought craft and when the tech was really booming, every is like, or Bitcoin was super hot, right? Everyone's like, oh, this guy's a dinosaur. He's out. He doesn't know anything. Well, turns out he's not. Then he turns around. He buys the Japanese trading houses at $0.10 on the dollar. He makes another brilliant move. And you're just like, wow, he's done it again. I mean, I think before 2008, he was another period in, you know, 2016, 2007 leading up to it where he looked like a dinosaur and then bang, he's saving the financial world in America and Making these investments in golden sacks. And, you know, so I think I think what I admire about the guy is, is, you know, we have all these sayings in life, like play the long game or learn how to how to sit with something. And it's really hard to do those things, right? Like it's all easier said than done. And I think he's managed to be able to do them. And, and I also, the other thing I admire about Warren Buffett is being able to express complex things in simple terms. It's like the Mark Twain saying, you know, I'm sorry, I wrote you such a long letter. I didn't have the time to write you a short one. When I was going to McGill, I, I, I went into management and I realized very early on that I didn't know how to write. I was a terrible writer. It's sort of a lost art form. And I want to learn how to write. So I went into English Lit at McGill and I ended up minoring in English Lit. It was serendipitous because I met my wife in English Lit. But I also learned how to write. I, I, I wrote for the McGill Daily newspaper. And I really wanted to turn what was a weakness for me into a strength. And I became, you know, an above average writer. I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm no Mark Twain and, but I'd like to think I can, I can write a decently persuasive email or letter. And I think that's a really important skill set. And where that comes in particularly helpful is how do you express a complex idea in simple terms. And no one does this better than Warren Buffett. I mean, you read his annual shareholder letters and he does such a good job taking, I mean, something as complicated as the energy industry or the railroad business and distilling it Into a few timeless principles. And he does this with investing as a whole, right? He teaches us how to have a perspective on investment and on investing that, that will sustain you through a lifetime. I wish I had his patience. I never will. Just not who I am. I think one of the differentiating factors for him is how, how rarely he actually moves on something and makes decisions. He sits on things longer than most. And I think, I think that's a rare quality. ([Time 0:56:53](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4b20de14-df8d-45d6-a1ef-605b89ba0528))
- Embrace Life with Perspective and Gratitude
  Summary:
  The key to a fulfilling life is embracing the journey with more perspective and gratitude, focusing on appreciating the good things in life rather than dwelling on challenges.
  Success lies in self-actualization and tapping into one's full potential, ensuring no regrets in the future. It is essential to choose a positive narrative, practice focusing on the good, and aim to use all 'eight cylinders' of one's capabilities, striving for personal development and deeper connections with loved ones.

  Speaker 2
  I feel that what's missing most in life right now.
  Speaker 1
  That's a tough question. I cheated before this interview and looked at your notes and I saw that question and I wasn't sure how to answer it. And I'm still not. I think it's a really difficult question answer. I think the answer is nothing. There are lots of things that I want, but there are a few things that I truly need that I don't have right now. I think what's missing is just more, more life, more embracing the journey, more being able to take it all in without feeling less than. Like, you know, like a failure, more being able to just appreciate all the good that's in life versus constantly. Persevering on on on what's difficult or missing or bad life is short and and it should be celebrated. It should be it should be elevated. And I think there are lots of things I want to do and accomplish. I mean, I definitely sit down once a year and I write out goals and I write out one year goals and three year goals and 10 year goals. But then I kind of like to say to myself and and and let's say I achieve none of them, right? Because you always have that sort of fear. Like, what if it doesn't work? What if I can't? What if I'm not that good at this? And what if I can't write and so what I got three healthy kids? I got a great marriage. I've I've made enough money. I've I've, you know, and so what? And I know that that sitting here, it's easy for me to say that a lot, you know, but it's all relative, right? And you have to remember that's all relative. Like there's always somebody who has more and there's always somebody who has less and that's true no matter where you are. You know, but the truth is like I was just as happy in that base room apartment in Montreal as I am now, you know, so much has changed in my life. But at the same time, the real changes, the real things that brought true happiness were the personal developments were my ability to connect with my wife on a deeper level where my ability To truly enjoy and appreciate my kids. I think we're all kind of playing for that no regret old age rocking chair moment. Yeah, at least I sort of use that as a yardstick be like, well, is this going to matter in my rocking chair? And of course, life has many twists and turns and who's to say you love or be in a rocking chair? I mean, it's it's I think it's just more of the sentiment than the reality. But I think I think that that thinking about the question what's missing in your life, you know, the answer is always perspective. You have to decide what narrative you want to live. Right? Like you don't get to choose a lot of things in life are completely out of your control. But but how you think about things and the narrative that you go through life with is in your control. You know, everybody could say, well, your pain is not as big as my pain or your hardships are as big as my hardships, but it's all relative. I mean, pain is pain and hardship is hardship. And yes, some are worse than others, but by and large, we all have things that we need to overcome. And I just think that that really it's it's doing the hard work to try and how can you continue to sharpen your perspective and your narratives that you can celebrate life and get the most Out of it.
  Speaker 2
  I like that because you're choosing where to focus, right? You choose your focus. You really do.
  Speaker 1
  And and that's something it needs to be practiced. It's not something you can't just tomorrow. I think it's hard to walk up wake up tomorrow. Like I don't have a positive mindset about everything. Well, you're not like you know, if you've gone through your life, having a negative mindset about everything, you're not going to be able to do that in one day. And probably not in one year and probably not in five years, frankly, but but how do you take one step forward in that journey towards having a better perspective and being able to enjoy Life more and celebrate all the good that's in your life and not just focus on all the things that are not what you want to be.
  Speaker 2
  We always end with the same question. I guess what it's think of it as the rocking chair question, which is what is success for you. What do you want to be sitting there looking back on? And you'd be like, that's that's success.
  Speaker 1
  When I was a little boy, my father used to say to me, he'd say, David, you're like an eight cylinder engine operating on two cylinders. And I didn't really know what he meant by that. I didn't know the world. I didn't I didn't know was out there. I didn't know all the possibilities. But but the more I go through life, the more I realized that that for me is very important. I don't want to ever look back and feel like I didn't use all eight cylinders. And I think that applies to everybody. You know, I don't want to feel that I didn't tap into my full potential. I don't know what that is right now. I can't tell you. We all have a certain level that we're going to reach. You know, not everyone's Michael Jordan and not everyone's going to be the the the Warren Buffett or the CEO or the president or whatever. Right. And I don't think that matters. I actually think what's far more important is did I self actualize all eight cylinders that I was able to to. Self actualize. Did I did I tap into my full engine? Hopefully one day on my rocking chair, as the rocking chair question, I'm able to say I did that. I didn't I didn't shortchange myself.
