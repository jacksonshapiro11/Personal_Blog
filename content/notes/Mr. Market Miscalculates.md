- Market Prices Reflect Psychology, Not Value
  Summary:
  Market price movements do not accurately reflect intrinsic value, particularly during crises, as they are influenced more by market psychology than fundamental changes.
  Fluctuations in prices indicate shifts in the market participants' perceptions rather than true changes in value. Daily price changes primarily denote changes in who wants to buy or sell based on their emotional reactions to news rather than the actual fundamentals of the economy, company, or asset.
  Significant price swings often result from the behavior of the most volatile market participants, highlighting the disconnect between perceived and intrinsic value.

  My bottom line is that markets don't assess intrinsic value from day to day, and certainly they don't do a good job during crises. Thus, market price movements don't say much about fundamentals. Even in the best of times, when investors are driven by fundamentals rather than psychology, markets show what the participants think value is rather than what value really is. Value is something the market doesn't know any more about than the average investor. And advice from the average investor obviously can't help you be an above average investor. Fundamentals, the outlook for an economy, company, or asset, don't change much from day to day. As a result, daily price changes are mostly about a. Changes in market psychology and thus b. Changes in who wants to own something or un-own something. These two statements become increasingly valid more daily prices fluctuate. Big fluctuations show that psychology is changing radically. What does the market know? January 2016. The market fluctuates at the whim of its most volatile participants. Those who are willing a. To buy at a big premium to the former price when the news is good and enthusiasm is riding high and b to sell at a big discount from the former price when the news is bad and pessimism is rampant.
