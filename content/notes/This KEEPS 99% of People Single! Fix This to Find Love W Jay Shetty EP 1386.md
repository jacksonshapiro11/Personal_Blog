  Speaker 2
  Do you think it's harder to learn how to love someone else or how to learn how to love yourself?
  Speaker 3
  Great question.
  Speaker 1
  So I believe that if you've gone through, and first of all, I want to say these four stages are not like you finish one and then you start the other. They're always integrated. Like you're always going to be in a couple of places. I find that if you're doing the work to learn to love yourself, that process and that skill helps you learn to love someone else. Let me give an example. If I'm learning to love myself, it means I have to get to know my dark side. It means I have to get to know my flaws. It means I have to get to know parts of myself that make me feel uncomfortable. Now if I recognize that I have all of that in me, now when I meet someone else, I'm not surprised when they have it in them because I've already seen it in myself and I think often if we think, oh, I'm going to meet someone and they're not going to have any issues or they're not going to have any challenges, it's partly because we haven't necessarily worked through our own. And so I think if your trauma is more visible to you, if your pain and your stress of the past is more visible to you, you're actually better at being compassionate to someone else's because you can see it's something that connects us.
  Speaker 2
  So it's when we're afraid of our darkness or our traumas or pains or, you know, sides of us that we don't enjoy what happens when we're afraid of it within us or we're afraid of it in others.
  Speaker 1
  When we're afraid of it in us, we're surprised when we see it in someone else because we haven't sat with compassion with ourselves because if we're constantly judging ourselves and berating ourselves and hating ourselves for some of the challenges or traumas that we have, maybe some things we did that we're ashamed of or we feel guilt and embarrassment around. Now, if you haven't worked through that, you're going to make that person feel guilty and embarrassed for what they've done because you haven't learned the skill of building space of dealing with yourself with empathy, with understanding, with compassion. So a really great example is this that if you've taught yourself how to play a sport, you can now watch someone else play sport and help them become better at it and understand the challenges they have. Whereas if you've never taught yourself how to play that sport, you just be looking at someone else going like, why are you holding the racket like that? Or why don't you know that? It's kind of like the guys that saw us.
  Speaker 4
  Yes.
  Speaker 1
  So if anyone does well, just to give a very relatable example, like being Lewis would play a pickleball last year quite regularly until I had an injury. And whenever we'd play, we'd play pickleball like tennis. So we'd be even doing the scores like tennis or ping pong. And we'd be like, just literally smacking the ball here and there. And then this father and son came up to us.
  Speaker 4
  Like some of our pro pickleball players. And they said, we overheard how you were counting and you were wrong.
  Speaker 1
  Like that's not how it works. And they taught us how, but they were so compassionate, they were so understanding, they were so like, I was like, I was really impressed. They were so slow with us. They weren't frustrated by us. I think we often get frustrated by other people's floors because we haven't looked at our own. Okay.

    - **Note:** Compassionate with yourself and others
