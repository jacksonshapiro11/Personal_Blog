### Highlights

- The pace of progress of market applications and technology are different so tech that might not be useful today could be valuable at some future time so we can’t trust our customers with disruptive innovation sustaining innovations usually helpful Disruptive tech needs an allocation of resources need attention because new ideas are out of the scope of current ideas obviously Usually need new customers/ value networks / orgs Uncertainty in investment decisions into desruption Counter positioning nature of desuption is a huge asset Principals of disruption 1. Customers don’t run to where the ball is going 2. Small markets don’t solve the needs of big companies 3. Markets that don’t exist can’t be quantified and so projects can’t be projected 4. Technology supply might not equal technology demand tech oversupply for use case Managers faced with disruption Market to meet customers set up a new org plan for failure and don’t count on breakthroughs just follow the market

    - **Note:** Disruptive innovation is non linear so it’s difficult to understand customer demand as well as market size. We must allocate to disruption because existing infrastructure and understanding of the market is under developed. These are low probability moonshots that many don’t understand tail risk non linear outcomes. People don’t run ti where the call is going. Principles of disruption. Appearance of small markets doesn’t help big companies
- This case study on evs was so off base shows there’s many ways to skin a cat and even the best most informed people really have no idea what to do when presented with hard problems and significant unknowns his go to market was the complete opposite of Tesla’s but couldn’t anticipate subsidies

    - **Note:** Experts know nothing much of that is picked up by doing and that’s a non linear process much of it is staying alive and putting yourself in a position to get lucky. Just get out there try things and adjust to the market
- Differentiation losses it’s meaning when the capabilities outrun the use case. Performance oversupply if you can achieved the desired result with half as complex a product why would you pay 2x for a more complex one. Performance oversupply drives product lifecycle. Buying hierarchy 4 phases functionality reliability convenience and price. As product matures it goes down this list starting at 1. Once it passes from one to another once that feature is widely offered. Crossing the chasm supports this is just another expression of the above framework. Other characteristics. Weakness of desruptive tech is a strength because it’s not valued in existing markets so it needs to find a novel use case or die. Build a product for a new market that wouldn’t work in existing market drives for mainframes useless for laptops and vice versa but you’re at the mercy of the new market. Incumbents or failures to adopt desruptive technology viewed it as a tech problem rather than a marketing problem they tried to mold the tech to the market when they needed to mold a market to the tech Ways to beat desruptive technology ascend the market you’re in through superior tech and sustaining innovations carve new higher end market 2.march in lockstep with certain customers in a market. This is generally very difficult to do. Keep customer type and market positions 3. Use marketing to build a market to fit your technology

    - **Note:** Disruptive tech can often be a marketing issue you have built a product for different market and don’t know it yet.
      Performance oversupply when you provide too much to a market and charge more than needed like providing 100 gbs rather than what the market needed which may be 1. No one would pay for extra.
      People buy on function reliability function and price in that row.
      Weakness of new tech is good because they must invent new markets and existing companies don’t understand how to do that.
      Find product market fit and find the right customers and value networks
- Capabilities are defined by resources processes and values of organization. As organization grows it values different things in different proportions a young company values a growth opportunity of $10mm different than a massive one. So based on values they’re more or less likely to undertake this task. Furthermore if a company values high margins they’ll miss a descriptive technology that is of lower margin but possibly bigger overall value opportunity because the framework of the company doesn’t fit the opportunity. Need first the killer application then processes to sustain and create more then a strong culture that persists but you will still be blind to different and new opportunities. When you acquire something are you acquiring their resources or processes. This depends on how you integrate. If you acquire processes then integrate the business you destroy the reason you acquired it. Of the cost structure current size of opportunity is very small when compared to the current meant and values of a new technology is different from the company it must be spun out and given free rope by those in charge/ won’t be constrained by existing organizational dogma. If they have higher costs into a smaller market they will lose funding unless given extra attention

    - **Note:** As organizations change they value different things and opportunities. People may be unwilling to give up margin but they ev may be higher even if the margin is lower. 
      Create a strong culture start with the killer app and form the best processes and be open minded to new and better opportunities don’t get blinded by what we see as existing. Don’t be constrained by dogma. Do what makes sense and disrupt yourself.
      Understand why you do certain things don’t make an acquisition for the team then change how they work. Innovation in big companies needs focus.
- Failed idea vs failed business inability to learn/ pivot knowing the market. Sometimes the business idea works but the execution is off or the first try is bad attacking the wrong market but eventually there is a huge market if they would’ve pivoted and kept trying things. Management focuses on what they think will work rather than appreciating big uncertainties exist and adjusting with dynamic planning light in their feet agile. Disruptive tech usually comes from unanticipated success use see through agnostic marketing

    - **Note:** this is the steer the boat every day mentality from singleton. The failed idea s a failed business are different you could have the right idea not executed or the wrong idea not pivoted from. success is business is defined by your response to failures that are inevitable. A lot of company success is not dying.
- Split organization that can get excited about small wins and successes. In sustaining tech first mover advantage doesn’t help but in disruptive innovation it helps a lot. 6% of entrants in sustaining industries earned more than 100 mm in revenue vs 37% in disruptive industries

    - **Note:** The importance of environment to shape your reality and the trade off of sustainability and disruption
- To be successful you can’t do two opposing things under one org you need to create a separate org with different values in processes doing two things accomplishes nothing

    - **Note:** Focus on what’s important and makes your beer taste better unclear focus and direction is death.
- Managers struggled with disruptive technology because the themes of good management and ideas of disruptive innovation run counter to each other so to seize the market of a descriptive innovations you would have to make a non optimal decision. You would’ve needed to invest in different sometimes worse tech into a smaller market with a lower chance of success. Issues with management 1. Resource dependence was dependent on current customers needs not unknown future possible customers 2. Small markets didn’t meet the big growth needs of large companies 3. Ultimate uses are unknowable and failure is an intrinsic step with higher probability of failure and ruin 4. Organizations cape abilities and systems aren’t designed for the disruptive technology processes and values in current business model also define disabilities when compared to disruptive technology strength is a weakness 5. Technology supply does equal market demand the weaknesses of a technology in one value system can be its strength in another value system How do utilize these 1. Imbed projects and new tech within organizations with customers who need or find the right base 2. Find organizations small enough to get excited about small opportunities and wins 3. Fail early fail often and cheaply in search for disruptive tech markets come through trial learning and error learning loop 4. Utilize some of the orgs resources but not processes or values of the org created different ways of working and set up that aligned to the goal 5. When commercializing the tech they found it developed new markets that valued the product rather than try to find a breakthrough so they knew there was product market fit While disruptive tech can change dynamics of industries the drivers of success and failure are consistent across industries

    - **Note:** disruptive tech fails in bigger orgs because the tech is often worse attacking a smaller market or opportunity outside the existing value chain. It's so far in the unknown and unknowable area that people just cant conceptualize success and the value of success is fairly low too. It requires non optimal decisions which good managers dont make but its just a long/ short term timing misalignment with decisions
- Working harder and doing the right thing actually hurts you in the long run because you optimize for a local max and have blinders on

- Companies see higher ev in investing in sustaining innovations braise its more predictable disruptive innovations are harder to model and thus justify investing in. Firms that make things have an entire network of suppliers and interrelated parties who they count on in a larger value network these partners may be disrupted by innovation and hyper these networks further disincentive 1. The value network in which a form competes guides resource allocation leads to innovation within the value network but nothing outside of it 2. Key determinant of success within the value chain is how much it helps customers current merge lead innovation with the industry but not new tech development local vs global Max 3. Established firms ignore technologies that its customers don’t care about bud could nonetheless disrupt them certain performance attributes are more important in some systems than others ie a laptop has different trade offs than a mainframe and optimizing a product for 1 system can lead to disruption of the other system comes to dominate 4. Entrant firms have an attackers advantage new entrants must enter new value networks altogether to make some headway 5. The attackers advantage can create and adapt to new value networks without the sunk cost of existing and past strategy

    - **Note:** Disruptive innovation is harder to model and justify on a spreadsheet so companies don’t approve it as much. It can also disrupt existing relationships and value network with customers and suppliers. New entrants don’t have these sunk costs and thus can form new companies with different economics. Innovators dilemma do you disrupt yourself or ignore it.
      It's hard to disrupt your value prop and network new firms have no bagged so see the world from the ground up
- The leaders in the industry often led with better products and more customer satisfaction they weren’t distrusted out of bad execution or laziness or not being on the cutting edge of their technology space. Disruptive tech was usually a simpler not more complicated set of things packed in a unique architecture that went after a different market. There were two different drives with different trade offs one was better for laptops other for desktops. The customers of incumbents were desktop and promoting other products would hurt their key business and customers. They made better products for the old paradigm but didn’t seize the new market and when the market rotated into new products they had the technology but not the propriety relationship with the new customer base so without new customers they had no mew sales and growth and eventually lost marketshare. Can’t see downward vision or seeing uses for their products or new products in areas outside their customer base. Ie instead of using in computers use them in medical devices too focused on their customers Summary 1. None of this was new tech just old technology organized in a different way 2. New tech was for incumbents sustaining technologies and not the cause of disruption 3. Firms that entered and disrupted the paradigm were often new entrants 4. Firms didn’t have downward vision to attack new customers and mew markets so they were trapped

    - **Note:** Disruptive innovation can usually be with whithed tech attacking a different market segment. It usually isnt better in many ways than the existing tech its built for a different market too small for the competition and grows organically so before you know it the company has been disrupted. Sustaining innovation rarely disrupt having the customer lock in is vital
- Principles of descriptive innovation 1. Companies rely on customers and investors for resources - create an independent organization that targets different investors and customers is the only way 2. Small machete don’t solve the growth needs of companies - tough to focus on small markets because harder to extrapolate them to being big and when they’re big enough it’s too late for a company. Can’t get data on market tough to realize before it’s too late. First mover advantage rules out existing competitors because market usually too small at inception to care 3. Markets that don’t exist can’t be analyzed - because most innovation is sustaining managers are set up to deal with that type of innovation but are Poor predictors of and planners for disruptive innovation 4. An organizations capabilities are also its disabilities Descriptive technologies we know least about the market and there are the strongest first move advantages this is the innovators dilemma Discovery based planning is kinda like blue teaming assume strategy and ideas are wrong and question assumptions to learn what needs to be known Issue is innovators produce better products and miss people at lower price points which opens the door for disruption due those seizing that opportunity market

    - **Note:** Disruptive innovation can often find new value chains with different customer networks for novel solutions to existing meta problems and existing customers struggle to adapt as they’re locked into their markets and value chains.
      Newer companies have the advantage of attacking smaller markets which larger companies see as too small and don’t even investigate.
- Technology the processes by which the organization transform labor materials and services into products this could be sales marketed ect doesn’t need to be manufacturing and innovation is a change in one of these processes. Balance existing business with disruption possibly on the horizon. Sustaining technology is an improvement in the existing technology while disruptive tech is usually a worse product with a better value prop. Good management sows the seeds of demise. People need to come up with good explanations When faced with a threatening technology organization need to take the outside view and build independently of their organization

    - **Note:** Technology the sustaining of existing tech and building of new disruptive tech and how it all fits into the value ecosystem. You need to take the outside view to avoid being disruptive. New tech is a worse product with a better value prop.
- Why is success so difficult to sustain and is successful innovation really as unpredictable as the data suggests
