  Speaker 1
  And he just thought like all the fancy, he says like all the fancy shit that they're teaching 12 year old seems to be a little crazy. Am I going crazy? It seems like they should just master the fundamentals and just master the basics. And so he calls up Michael Jordan, he's like, hey, I'm having a little trouble remembering what I was learning at 12. But I don't think it was all this fancy stuff. And Michael's response was great. Michael, dude, I was at 12. I was playing baseball. And Kobe's being interviewed by I think Alex Rodriguez, the basketball the baseball player and I can't remember the other guy sitting across from him. But his response to them was like, think about that. The greatest player to ever play hadn't picked up a ball yet at 12 years old. Your 12 year old kid does not need all these fancy moves. And that's something that Kobe mentioned a bunch from learning from a good or he said he would say in another interview, he was like, listen, people, my generation, when they said he Michael, they saw the flash, they saw the money, they saw the, you know, the highlight reel, he goes, I understood the fundamentals. I saw his footwork. I saw his defense. I saw the way he's shrink trained. In other words, Kobe wasn't distracted by the fad or the flash he focused on the fundamentals. And Kobe even explicitly states this over and over again, he did so in writing when he was writing the book, Mama mentality says over the years, my routine might have changed. But my philosophy never did. If something has worked for other greats before you, and if something is working for you, why change it up and embrace some new fad stick with what works even if it's unpopular? He is telling you and I with that statement, time is the best filter study the greats. And so all this was top of mind because I was listening to an episode of the jocko podcast with this wrestler named bow nickel. And he was telling the story because he won national championship after national championship like one every basically every single word you could as a amateur wrestler in college. And he made the point was the fact that what's fascinating is, you know, if you go back, I think something over the last like, I don't know, 12 to 14 years, I think he said Penn State had won Like 10 or 11 of the national title. So the point was is this program where he's absolutely dominating the rest of their peers in what they're trying to accomplish, right? And he says listen, the same people, as far as the admitted the coach that the coaching staff and the people actually built this program, it's been the same people the whole time. They could tell you they could go in their offices and they could tell you what they said on this day, last year, what they practice on this day last year, what they said in practice five Years ago, what they said in practice 10 years ago, and they made the point that it is the attention to detail and the mastering of the fundamentals over and over and over again. People are like, how are you doing this? How are you able to dominate for a decade? You must have all these new ideas. And they're like, no, go look at the books. We preach the same thing. We do the same thing. We've identified a handful of principles to get us closer to success. And then we spend all of our time mastering them, repetition, repetition, repetition. There's always going to be new trends and new ways to make money, but the fundamentals of business don't change. Create a product or service that makes someone else's life better. While you're doing so, watch your costs. Work with the best people you can because people are power law and the best ones change everything. Study the history of your industry and business in general, because learning from history is a form of leverage and something all the greats do and did. Spend a lot of time practicing your craft because the public praises people for what they practice in private and then do this for a long time so all the benefits can compound in your favor.
