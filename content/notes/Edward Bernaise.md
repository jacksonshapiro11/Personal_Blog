- Was the inventor of public relations he made all his private files public after his death. He succeeded through doggedness and inventiveness. He mastered the spin. He was a living contradiction he marketed cigarettes and public health. He used deception and unconventional think and tied his public missions to private causes. He went indirect. When he was tapped to sell more books he went to real estate developers to build more bookshelves rather than marketing books because people fill up bookshelves. He was a unique person. Unconventional thinker who pushes the boundaries. Tie private interest to public cause. Problems are opportunities in work clothes. His uncle was sigmund frued. His mom was frueds sister and his dads sister married frued. Because of this he knew the value of psychology before almost anyone else. His big secret.

    - **Note:** He knew a lot of psychology before many and used it to persuade he also inverted problems well and thought differently and from a unique angle. Was inventive and personally driven he would market cigarettes and health hired gun. His knowledge of psychology was his unique differentiation Machiavelli
- He wanted to market a play on stds which he knew nyc wouldn’t approve so instead he marketed it as a way to spread public health awareness. Attached the product to a desire. The good ones know more when you do something you need deep subject knowledge. You don’t need to be the smartest but you can be the best informed. He wanted to to get land in South America so he spread communist fears about the country and got the cia and fbi on his side. Look behind a persons fame to ascertain if the basis is real or superficial and public fame has little to do with real value. The public can create hero’s through memetic desire. You can make singers famous over night and he used this to make products overnight. When he promotes something he has many vectors of attack and he would market through ancillary groups he never went direct. He said under a guise that not eating sweets and smoking would make you lose weight. He didn’t believe in what he was selling. He wanted women to smoke more in public because of a stigma he called cigarettes torches of freedom and smoking in public was empowering women. This was full deception. The mind is a powerful place and what you feed it has a big effect.

- He aligned interest and was relentless. Tried so many vectors of attack. Didn’t care about anything but work his family hated him. His set up was very successful. Instead of teaching a product or service he teaches behavior. Defied convention and believed in his own agency. In an era of mass communications modesty is a private virtue and public fault. He aggressively told his own story. He was a pr man through and through. He wanted to get his ideas into the public. Easier to change the beliefs of millions instead of one man. Easier to charge high fees than low fees. Easier to gain acceptance by citing authorities and outlining your views vs telling people they’re wrong. Advice on getting a job. Identify the top places in the industry draft a blueprint to increasing their business and write enough so they remember you but not too much you’re annoying ask for what you’re worth and remember you’re building a career.
