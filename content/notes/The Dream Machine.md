### Highlights

- Licklider envisioned the modern day internet as we know it today with networking ect. He didn’t think on mathematical symbols but in information flows and relationships. He was always interested in technology and very curious fixing cars ect. He was also a good southern gentleman. Was very curious and loved learning. He was grounded in neuroscience and approached computers from a psychology background and saw computers as companions to humans when many other computer people were pure machinists. He graduated with a triple major in math physics and psychology. Lick would talk to anyone and when he went to the soda machine which was often he’d come back with sodas for everyone he was down to earth and humble. He was very curious and would go to the subject matter expert to learn from always

    - **Note:** Lick thought at a systems level for inventing the computer. Not in the ones and zeros but in the human computer relationships different level of emergence. How using math and psychology humans and computers could create a lolapolza effect. Cross disciplinary systems thinker who always looked out for others and was the proper humble southern gentleman
      He was the right person at the right place and time that synthesized all the big ideas from big disciplines. Followed his own path.
- Norbert weiner was a mathematical genius who was home schooled by his father who was very tough on him and got his phd at 18. He was incredibly absent minded terrible with people and also lifted the MIT math department from nothing to prominence. He did things his own way given his lack of formal education
- Vannevar bush was at MIT at the same time as weiner but soon left to play a larger part in ww2 in dc. Before going he wrote as we think which described a memex this was an automatic personal filing system that set the stage for both hyperlinks www and personal computing from a values perspective. This was too late for it’s time but too early for the computers it influences as it was 1945. Weiner proposed a computer to bush to help the ww2 effort but he didn’t allocate funding viewing the ideas of radar and the bomb as more practical but he could’ve sped up computing decades. Bush developed a differential analyzer which was a preview to a computer for the Rockefeller institute and he hired a university graduate named Claude Shannon to work on it and he did his phd on this noting the use of binary calculations to do math for these machines. This also allowed computers to work its way through many different conditional steps allowing for it to think more human. Shannon’s masters thesis on switching remains one of the most important papers of the 20th century it set the table for how computers worked. There was a teletype computer device developed at bell labs which set the stage for Norbert wieners idea on computation not a few months after the display. Adinasov a professor at Iowa decided he wanted to make a computer and predicated it around base 2 numbers and vacuum tubes along with Berry a grad student it became know as the adinasov berry computer or abc. Much of the desire for a computer was to save time doing math. Howard Aiken developed the Mark 1 at Harvard modeled after the ideas of charges babbage this with ibm engineers became the first computer to enter the public consciousness but the base 10 system among other features made it impractical. The 1930s was about setting the conceptual framework for what would eventually be the computer. Another program was ENEAC which was thought to be too far in the future to be practical but was what von noumann needed as part of the Manhattan project given the high number of calculations

    - **Note:** Much of the 1930s was setting the conceptual framework for what would be the computer. Trying different paths before converging on one that took the best of many avenues. Important discoveries a long the way like switching and memex. Also interesting that bush who was so involved in computation still didn’t advance it vs other war time needs. Could’ve rapidly sped up computation. Path dependent. This founding of the system is similar to tex winter installing the triangle offense for the bulls. System building instead of the easy way out of what's best today
      You’re pulling base 2 vs 10 different people working on different architecture steps back in funding invention of www but not appreciated so misstep and step forward and past utilized step
      Blind walk through innovations Forrest.
- The eneac was a new type of computer more ambitious than anything that existed and basked and consulted on by von noumann who was. Turing took also entered the fray and helped prove out goedls incompleteness theorem. Turing would often figure something out by himself without looking at the literature very original. Turing described his computing machine his Turing machine. In order to settle the decidability problem and all computers could do all these calculations but memory and speed determined how fast it was done. The core hits was the same. In his solving the decidability problem Turing laid the groundwork for the first turing machine. The solution to the problem was discovered by Alonzo church by more conventional methods but Turing’s ingenuity got his still published and an invite to study under church at Princeton where he bumped shoulders with Einstein and von Neumann who invited turing to be his assistant a high honor but turing missed home and a war was on. Weiner at this time was working on a method to neutralize the luftwaffe and discovered that while you couldn’t figure out a pilots next spot using aircraft constraints Pilot skill and human reaction time you could make a guess at his course this helped separate the signal from the noise and was the Seminole paper on doing this. Their system in building this challenged the idea of the mind body problem as this machine was able to think and predict simply using feedback from the environment and heuristics. Feedback is based on communication and control questions if all humans were was stimulus responders. The idea that the nervous system was just a mechanical device responding to stimulus allowed the conclusion that likewise machines could be biological devices and this connection was the start of AI thinking the brain just as information processors and bridging the gap between body and mind between active matter and purposeful spirit. A thermostat has a purpose and reacts to the environment and so it is in the mind as well while the goal might be different or seemingly more complex the process is uninform. Of we get how a machine embodies purpose we can understand how we ourselves embody purpose. If one simple feedback loop is enough to create purpose what could millions do in a brain. This became the best challenge to the mind body problem in thousands of years. Mccullock and pitts were the first to write about neural networks which showed the equivalence of all Turing machines and further linked the computationally mechanical with the biological mind and thought. Von Neumann and eckert work with 4 people coming up with the idea of software and storing a program completely abstract from the hardware this innovation and split between software and hardware could’ve been the biggest advancement in computer science ever imagine if they were necessarily packaged
- Behaviorists believed there was no mind just stimulus and reactions and this became the only accepted dogma in psychology it allowed the thought that people could be trained to be anything and allowed for rigorous scientific experiments for a softer science but if you didnt subscribe to this narrow branch of psychology you didn’t have a career as a psychologist and the behaviorist ideas of no free thought humans as machines was likely wrong as well but groupthink prevailed. They would do pigeon experiments teaching them how to play ping pong and have a ton of data but if you tried to get the why behind the data and build mathematical models of things that could not be observed it was considered unscientific reacted violently was a religious movement. Skinner wanted to turn dials and see behavior change didn’t want the messy reality

    - **Note:** The issues of dogma neglecting good debate and the pursuit of good explanations. Zealots. There is so much we believe now that is so wrong. Maintain the critical approach don't give into dogma always get the why
- Marvin minsky - the basement at Harvard had the behaviorists who wanted behavior without a theory and physical psychologists who were trying to understand a small part of the nervous system without a picture of the risk in the middle was jcr licklider and George a miller thought not with blind mysticism or clear reductionism to be completely rigorous and scientific but still believe in the power of the mind
- Shannon was a man of first principles and his information theory had 5 parts 
  1. Information source 2. Transmitter that makes the initial source legible 3. Communication channel like air or wires 4. The receiver that gets the message and deconstructed 5. The person or thing the message is intended for and this all measured information known as the useful part of the signal. Something has high information content if it’s surprising or novel and low content if it’s expected a u after a q has almost 0 info content because u almost always follows q but the score of tomorrows game has some non zero and greater info content however when you watch it the information of the score post game provides almost no information to you if you have perfect memory. Information vs meaning. Information is just the novel 1 and 0 so will you marry me can be a 1 vs a complex legal doc which needs to encoded with many more bits but the signal through the noise of the first level of information is much higher. There is the carrying capacity of the information source as well as the message the capacity per second of a super computer is higher than a telegraph as long as your message is below the speed limit of the system using error correcting codes you can transmit messages with perfect fidelity but as long as you send more data ect to make up for the noise distraction you can transmit near perfect info. Turing and Shannon were friends and their work was complementary
- John von Neumann worked on post war computer development helping develop RAMand developed the ideas behind automatons and biological system automita given resources could reproduce themselves and likewise evolve. Automita needed to pass both all the genetic information on but also the encoding information for future generations. Genetic material of self reproducing system had to have 2 functions serving and live machine code and algorithm that could create offspring but also as data that could be passed to the offspring so they could reproduce. This was pre DNA discovery but almost perfectly outlined DNA when it was discovered a few years later in 53. Weiner and von Neumann once so close we’re driven apart by the bomb and the political nature it created in science these man once so close grew apart due to their ideological differences on war and the bomb. JvN invented game theory but the men viewed the idea differently from their prior assumptions
- Cybernetics - humans were neither gods nor clay not the masters of the universe but not subject to it lived in a world that was complex and confusing but we weren’t helpless in this world we had the power to learn and grow. The world is an organism and knowledge is the essence of life and it’s the interplay of an individual and his environment this was a message of hope. We must always exert the full strength of our imagination

    - **Note:** Great quote "The world is an organism and knowledge is the essence of life and it’s the interplay of an individual and his environment this was a message of hope. We must always exert the full strength of our imagination" <-- through knowledge we grow in a complex system combining agency and opportunity. Humans have the agency to do anything
- What a person expects to hear influences what he does hear. Lick didn’t want to replace people with tech but aid humans with technology to grow
    - **Note:** human computer symbiosis. People are influenced by their own biases.
- Lick went to MIT to teach psychology and create the department he also did a lot of Cold War work there. He believed psychology and engineering should be grounded from the beginning instead of bringing in the psych people later. The whirlpool computer was built and MIT and lick came in from Harvard to help with project Lincoln that tried to refine radar for the Cold War using computers the entire tech stack for the Lincoln lab was beyond cutting edge. Lick didn’t have a team he had a family. The team had the freedom to make mistakes recognize them and move on no finger pointing. They also go decisions quickly from the government and had a high degree of trust cut through bureaucracy. The Lincoln project was a massive step in both the history of computers and programming with many massive innovations made in the construction. Also they had to find programmers which wasn’t to say that only math types could program because of it’s artistic and Well as detail oriented demands almost anyone could be a good programmer as in any background. The saber project as it was known planted the seeds for the pc revolution shoeing the value of humans and computers working as one

    - **Note:** Lick immediately linked cross disciplinary thinking with UI and UX. He got things done in a bureaucracy with a high trust culture. Lick did not have a team but a family working on the cutting edge. They made decisions fast importance of speed and they saw talent everywhere not just in the math types
- Alan Turing was doing work on what would become chaos theory in the 50s while von Neumann moved to government work both would not last as they died in the 50s. Von Neumann even sought spiritual counsel at the end despite not being religious at all. The lab at MIT fell away without administration support even though it had a 20 year lead in cognitive psychology many of the phd went to found psychology departments elsewhere.
    - **Tags:** #favorite, #a-players, #support-for-others, #chaos, #believe-in-others, #meaning-of-life, #fragility-of-life, #administrative-support
    - **Note:** Admin support tanked what was so far ahead of the world; the need for support of burgeoning movements is vital. End of life belief in god. The loss of great people and how fragile life is.
- George miller basically killer behaviorism when he discovered how people could make decisions or remember things of a few items or more which lead to the idea of chunking the ability to remember about 7 chunks of info at once. The idea of associative memory was difficult for behaviorists to rectify showed that minds are able to structure data which lead to the idea that this could be happening for more data and experiences and that true thinking was going on and the black box of the mind was starting to become enlightened. Also viewed information processing at computation. Bf skinner argued language was based on past stimulus responses such that saying John was likely to be followed by kiss ect. This idea was refuted by Noam Chomsky who instead argued we learned basics of language and grammar from which we had rules to think and form sentences thinking was counter to behaviorism. The idea that language was based on grammatical systems that had a hierarchy of rules and with different hierarchy at different levels you got different language and that our form of language was based on very complex grammar constructions that our minds were very complex forms of Turing machines because that’s what was needed to execute human grammar

    - **Note:** Bad explanations behaviorism. Seeing grammar as a model and humans as sentient purpose driven thinking machines. The behaviorists thought we were stimulus response but using new discoveries and better explanations we transcended that and showed a complex ability for thought and latticework of ideas. Our core beliefs can be wrong that’s the norm. Early stages of mind being deeply complex
- Herbert Simon and Alan Newell built a machine so model human thought because humans were far to complex to model with equations and symbols wanted to be for thought what newton was to mathematics. Simon also coined satisficing and bounded rationality. Newell and Simon even after codifying the idea of proofs showed that to discover all the proofs in chapter 2 of primcipa mathematica would take longer than the age of the universe so there had to be some sort of complex information processing algorithm in the mind. Their key insight was using heuristics to guide thinking instead of iterating through every option. The way they discovered this was by solving proofs in the principia and diagramming steps into a flow chart then coding this. Through this they were able to develop the first heuristic thinking computer pair this with Noam Chomsky’s talk on grammar and it priced to be a big conference and formative step for George millers thinking on thinking and intelligence. Showed how these behaviors lead to information processing

    - **Note:** The invention of heuristics and recreation of human thinking patterns was a death shot to the behaviorists who saw us as stimulus response animals. Guided thinking these showed answers to questions like mind body that had been debated for centuries started to develop AI and the idea of thought. Proof of thinking
      Interesting to see computers answer a psychology debate problems > fields
      Crazy how people thought humans couldn't think dogma is bad
- Cybernetics - purpose through feedback
  This conference showed deliberative reasoning through information processing
  The magic was not in the neurons but in their organization
  Logic theory showed we had artifacts that could behave intelligently
  Computation set the ground to prove behaviorism wrong and set the stage for cognitive psychology

    - **Note:** Cybernetics the idea of creating ideas through processing and feedback. Our brain wasn't just about reacting neurons but using their organization to create intelligent behavior. Complex adaptive system not just feedback response. These different groups working on disparate projects came together at the right time.
- The tx0 tried to create the first personal computing experience previously computers were semi god like behemoths that were used for research and government but in tx0 and later tx2 marketed to normal people and sought to make computers fun and approachable. Lick loved this. Lick realized that 85% of his time was setting up to actually think and that with human computer symbiosis both man and machine could be empowered this idea/ epiphany governed his life from then on
    - **Tags:** #human-computer-symbiosis, #life-changing-idea, #technology-(creating-efficency)
    - **Note:** Lick got hooked on the pc revolution that one idea changed the course of his life completely. Lick got one shot Ted
- Lock decided after 20 years in academics and launching the new forks of cognitive psychology that computers was his future and basically dropped his entire life’s work. He went to BBM and made them get a computer for 50k and he just programmed and hacked then he was the first beta tester along with a high school drop out former fighter pilot turned programmer who fit his criteria of being bright so he got hired. The pdp did not try to use micro chips to improve on the previous vacuum tube architecture but completely re-engineered the computer for transistors which made it a step change innovation in performance for the same price. Lick used this to hack can programmed constantly.

    - **Note:** After being a foremost expert in cognitive psychology and a founder of the field we quit to follow his interests. Hired talent not resumes. Became a hacker. Pdp using transitors and embracing technology. They needed to completely re-architect the computer for it to have a step change innovation. Rebuilt from first principles. The microchips led to new innovation, where the innovation completely re-architected the solution much like in the way GPU are re-architecting computers now optimize for the new technology.
- AI John McCarthy created an AI conference at Dartmouth to deconstruct how computers thought he was a half Jewish half communist and he also invented time sharing revolutionary in computer utilization when personal computers were so far away and all you had were these massive machines. McCarthy was a genius. McCarthy benefited from the invention of programming languages which made computers more accessible and valuable to the average person. McCarthy then invented unlike cobal and Fortran this was not a committee invention but basically all McCarthy and utilized the primatives of lists in computer programming

    - **Note:** First Ai conference. A players standing on the shoulders of giants using new innovations applied to classical problems. Lisp vs Fortran. Seeing the future. Creating emergent programs self organizing languages.
- Fortran - allowed for decomposition for routines into subroutines started with the macro then got into the details. This was well suited to batch processing
  Lisp- was object oriented program bottom up with functions written that could then be combined or used anywhere else for any other purpose this was slower as it went line by line but much more emergent.
  McCarty pushed time sharing

    - **Note:** Fortran did math faster but lisp opened the problem space so emergently. Optimize for emergence more speed. Trade off of efficiency and self organization.
- Lick collected people and ideas and became the synthesizer of much of the movement there was no leader as all the participants were very independent. Lock wrote his Seminole paper on human computer symbiosis on how humans worked with computers which laid out how humans and computers could work together and described the ideas of network centers a shared connected library of computers the first idea of the internet. Computers lick saw could not only mitigate monotony but enhance creativity and create models. A model is any convienient simulation of reality but some models carry a lot more weight and truth than others these are static vs dynamic models. Static just exist while dynamic models change with the world. Computers allowed for static programs that didn’t change but code was infinitely malleable. With code you could model a plane or a mathematical equation a static model executed in a computer and as it’s executed it’s dynamic and while basic models may just output text some models could create universes where the model reacts to the user and likewise. Computers allow peoples mental models the most complex of all models to be aided as computers are great at digesting complexity and humans aren’t. Information is dynamic and knowledge can take on codification through coding languages. The issue with mental models is they exist in peoples heads but if you could outwardly express a model and people could agree on it you can have more second level conversations and you can only get past the first level by understanding and critiquing the other persons base model.

    - **Note:** Lick collected A players for his building of the arpa net and saw the importance of dynamic models that computers could create. Information and knowledge is dynamic and computers ability to model this was vital. Likewise in a good conversation understanding others models to get to the next level is important you need to agree on the language before you can jump up a level. This also goes into human computer symbiosis and the importance of good models with reach
      Level 2 conversations first understand how people view the world then abstract from there.
- Need a computer based systems system. First you need to find the relevant info then you need to extract it and find the important stuff within the information then you need to synthesize that info then you need to apply the knowledge you’ve learned. Only then your search is complete. This revolution was going ok and computer human symbiosis was going well but it was niche. Then they offered a course on coding taken by train model railroad builders who loved coding and used the tx0 all hours of the night to write fun programs they called a cool new train design a hack this is where the term hackers came from
    - **Tags:** #hacker, #foundings-of-a-movement, #learning-process, #computation
    - **Note:** This is a great mental model for finding information. Find identify important bits synthesize and then apply.
      Origin of the word hacker.
- Batch processing was still the big paradigm and the tx0 didn’t get big use even though it was better no one really knew about it so it just wasn’t very popular but as the limits of batch processing was realized time sharing became more prominent and computers like the tx0 started to come into vougue. Computing revolution was going ok but it needed a champion
    - **Tags:** #computation, #batch-processing, #self-organizing-system
    - **Note:** The computer revolution was underway, but change is hard and people didn’t immediately see the benefits of batch processing. Time sharing allowed for shared use of one resource.
- Sputnik dashed the idea of American superiority and gave the nation the sufficient kick in the ass it needed to kick on. The political environment for contemptuous and people realized change was needed even though the us in reality wasn’t r really behind the soviets the media bashed America and the people were delishionse this lead to arpa. Thus marked the golden age of R&d. Arpa cut through the Bs did things that look months to get approval days

    - **Note:** The Soviet successes really helped fund arpa and the golden age of r and d. You need an enemy. The idea never got to escape velocity until it reached this critical mass of support
- Lick got tapped to run the command and control center at the pentagon a part of arpa he used his new position and 10mm to fund timesharing computation. He funded his friends at mit and carnige tech. And brought in John McCarthy and the mit crew to convince their biggest contractor of the importance of time sharing
    - **Tags:** #arpa, #a-players
- Doug englebart researched intelligence saw the brain as a raw material and all experiences were data storage units in the brain all connected in some lattice work. The organization of these lower level units of knowledge and subroutines was intelligence. Isolated skills and concepts are useless unless they can be organized into a larger framework which we call intelligence. Wanted lick to fund an interdisciplinary knowledge and communication lab to pursue the idea of human computer symbiosis. This report on human computer augmentation was on licks desk the first day he started at the command and control center and he funded him from a values perspective. Emglebart always credits lick with giving him his first big shot

    - **Note:** The idea of intelligence as a latticework of mental models and the development of the views on how intelligence manifests. Point solutions and subroutines must be integrated into a bigger system. Cross disciplinary synthesis.
- Lick had built his arpa network of funding but he had to coordinate them all so they didn’t repeat work but instead built on top of others. They wanted one system not 10 different languages ect. Mandated that all arpa computers must be linked to each other so they could communicate. Time sharing computers. This memo was the first writing of the arpanet which soon became the internet

    - **Note:** The building of the internet was both top down and bottom up and required intense communication and coordination as well as a players. Lick wanted to make sure everyone was coordinated so they could stand and build on each others shoulders.
- The MIT summer study was the first time people were sharing programs and meeting digitally without ever knowing what they looked like in reality. Was revolutionary in its own right. The first for the digital world. This summer study set the stage for the future of computation with many if not all the important people there. What starts as a convince eventually becomes a utility. The project mac at mit was very slow. They strung telephone wires to researchers houses with terminals being the first home computers. CTSS human computer interaction and file system is seen in dos and Linux systems. Set the frameworks here for much of what computers would become. In information utility unlike in power utility energy flows both ways with users contributing information to the network building in itself. Open system designed by Francisco corbado so each user could make the system their thing. Corbado was a great systems engineer and planned for things when they went wrong not if.

    - **Note:** The MIT summer study set the stage for what would be the internet and the future of computation with many of the biggest players helping shape the future of the space. They build resilience into the system and this is important to see the beginning of an important movement/
- IBM 360 was the new system which was designed to be static with 1 processor the MIT people needed a dynamic system in both memory and processing power. IBM still focused on batch processing and even though they were mits supplier the relationship wasn’t working from an ideological point of view. MIT adopted GE as their contractor who treated them like a partner when IBM only treated them as an account. IBM was do fixed in its mindset against time sharing it lost bell labs as well then they tried to adapt 360 system to timesharing but it was very hard. Then again you couldn’t speak out against 360 at ibm it was a holy war. In business computing the 360 was a hit but in the scientific market it struggled. The horrors of creating and adapting the 360 to its goals are famous or infamous in software engineering lore

    - **Note:** IBM was always the supplier for MIT but took their eye off the ball and GE took over. They didn't listen to their needs and thus they switched. There was a religion around the 360 technology and this is usually a bad sign in innovation an anti rational meme. The aura abs hierarchy around ibm was almost religious so debate was impossible
      Creating true partnership and remaining mentally flexible
- Lick eventually had to leave arpa and went to ibm to try to turn the company’s focus on time sharing in his stead he nominated Ivan southland to director of arpa an inexperienced26 year old who developed sketch pad a drawing gui that basically created the standard for touch type
- Lick didn’t do much but in that he did a lot. Many of the trends like timesharing were in place before lick but his work at arpa helped connect computing professionals from all over and catalyzed the next generation toward computation lick took the long view and poured money into computer science which attracted grad students and created the cs field.

    - **Note:** Lick built a robust system for the future that set into place much of what would help develop the internet. Knowledge lies in the connections and synthesis
- Bob Taylor was a psychoacoustic researcher always interested in human machine dynamics he loved cars who read licks paper and realized how important human computer symbiosis could be. He became an integral part of licks team and grew to believe computation wasn’t just about one person but communication between people was they key. Taylor became the 3rd director after Ivan southerland. Taylor was seen as an admin not with the technical chops and even scoffed at but he didn’t listen. Taylor’s goal was networking most notably to build the intergalactic network between all arpa computers. Larry Roberts became the head of this networking team a close friend of southerland who may have invented the first neural network and while the research people didn’t respect Taylor he had Wes Clark and lick and was able to get 1mm from the director of arpa to do his project in a 15 minute meeting. The idea was they would build a network through terminals connected to routers based on packet switching the community was first against this then go excited at the technical challenge. Vietnam was in the air but this never lost funding because while arpa struggled the network always appealed well to the director. The community also became closer like lick had wanted at a time the country was fracturing everywhere. Network at this meeting wasn’t big but eventually it would gain prominence

    - **Note:** People doubted Bob Taylor. The importance of organizational/ general support. Value of community. Inventing networking. He had a fuck you attitude to prove the people who didn’t respect him wrong. Made so much progress for community.
- The idea was a network was going to be developed at ucla ucsb Utah and sri. As a 4 node proof of concept. Doug englebart at sri did an unauthorized presentation of the network that could’ve killed the entire project had it failed. He was given the go ahead but if anything went wrong it was his ass and the higher ups would deny it. The entire audience was transfixed with the entire display and it was a success. Also timesharing had become more widely accepted at this time which helped. Lick saw the internet in 1970 as television high-fi and micro film the family receives its news and entertainment does its shopping and gives thousands of people what it was like to use a computer. He got a standing ovation and this started working its way into the mainstream it was a huge success. Bbn Got the networking contract somehow among the 12 large companies that got tapped and put in rfps. This was licks old crew. They basically had to invent all of modern networking. Eventually the imp was running at UCLA and the arpa net was online going from contract award to implementation in 9 months. Lick didn’t last long at Ibm and soon moved back to mit was too corporate and stuffy

    - **Note:** The risk and reward in creation. These people built networking but lick couldn’t work at ibm. Wasn’t built for it. This demonstration of computation was high cost of failure but if it went well would catalyze the project. Lick took a computer and saw Netflix before there was networking. Genius hits targets others can’t see.
- Lick took over the effort at MIT that was struggling and he didn’t do much to improve it in fact he made it worse and eventually the multix project disbanded but on the positive side 2 bell labs engineers had enough of batch processing and needed the power of timesharing on the side after multix was disbanded they built Unix on a pdp7. As part of arpa the first email program was built and this was one of the first clear proof of concepts that really got everyone excited about the arpa net. They displayed the arpa net in dc with people who would become legends in the space. In created arpa net they had a working group that was hyper Democratic bottom up decision making that became the governance model for the internet
    - **Note:** Bottoms up revolution. Email as a proof of concept.
- Never hire good people because 1 great person = 10 good people. At this time semi conductors and moores law were being understood and Bob Taylor left to join xerox to build out there computer division. Computation wasn’t about building hardware and projecting growth forward but seeing how these new technologies would change peoples lives. Intel was pushing micro computation off the ground. Taylor hired great people but great people together and see what they could do. Taylor didn’t want to manage people he wanted them to be self starters and manage themselves and he’d fight hard for his people. He gave people the freedom to create but not to build a technologies but a system of technology that changed humans worked together

    - **Note:** The importance of creating a critical mass of smart people and letting them run wild. A players hire as bs hire cs. High agency players. Early days of computation were as much about human computer symbiosis as hardware development. Taylor managed by getting rid of the bs to allow his workers to run free. They need to build the tech and social layer.
- Management - get all the smart people moving in the same direction without them moving in lockstep give them a sense of purpose and group cohesion without crushing spontaneity and individual initiative he needed to set things up so people would follow their instincts and organize themselves. He put into practice what he liked and threw away the rest. The goal was to live in the future. Build technology and use it and he made everyone present ideas once a week

    - **Note:** Lick on management. He wanted to cultivate a culture of openness curiosity and learning. Allowing people to follow their passions constantly trying new things and throwing out what didn't work. Allowed for a high level goal then gave people agency to explore what that meant to them
      He set the culture vision and allowed for flexible execution start up advice. Directed emergence.
- Class 1 disagreement is when you just yell at each other
  class 2 disagreement is when you understand the other side as well as your own you don’t need to believe the other guy just give a fair account of his ideas so everyone had the same ideas and assumptions. Allan Kay was a man who though extremely for himself and learned voraciously. Thought different. Kay realize that due to moores law desktop computation was much closer than many thought

    - **Note:** Class 1 vs 2 disagreements. Yelling back understanding. Class 1 is emotional I’m right class 2 is let’s align mental models and definitions so we can talk about the merits of both sides.
- True learning was curiosity exploration and fitting each experience into the whole meta experience. Bob metcalf discovered the aloha network which used radio instead of telephone lines to transmit packets. He then improved the design to create what became known as Ethernet where info was blasted into the ether and if it wasn’t received it was just reblasted after waiting. Then Bob Kahn wanted to connect these networks the architect bring a way for these different networks to talk to each other an inter network communication or internet

    - **Note:** The invention of the internet was very non linear and happened in steps with each discovery enabling new whitespace. First you discover packet switching then Ethernet which enables internet.
- In developing the internet the packets from different networks would need a universal protocol to transfer the language of one network to another. They created an envelope approach which made all the cross communication uniform in one language they created a universal protocol called tcp the Transmission Control Protocol this would make sure packets get processed and if not received and ip became the address of the packet combining to become TCP/IP’s
  Alto was the first real personal computer with UI and Ethernet. This ui became the basis for both the Mac and window interface

- Parc at xerox gave the entire arpa community a way to do research under a corporate umbrella that prioritized the long term. They invented personal computing Ethernet guis object oriented programming many of the primitives we still use today. The ceo of xerox died and the head of parc became a numbers guy and didn’t fund any new research nothing that couldn’t be penciled out which killed creativity. Arpa became more results focused instead of research focused and thus lead to “practicality” at the trade off of innovation arpa became a normal agency and no longer was above and beyond special. Xerox management saw each device as an innovation not a new system

    - **Note:** Innovations are step change moments that cannot be estimated when you try to optimize you hurt your ability to create. A culture that embraces emergence and failure as a part of learning is vital to creating. When you focus on the practical and avoid the crazy your ideas and innovation start dying. You need to embrace the crazy. Moonshots vs settling.
      This is how innovation happens.
- Lick was the spiritual leader of the MIT group and his team was cohesive because he encouraged them and cared. Lick believed by 2000 there would be an electronic commons. Even in the late 70s with the infrastructure in place the idea a free and open network would win over a permissioned fragmented network was optimistic and generally against the grain. The companies wanted to build private networks and the whole industry was hanging by a thread the idea of these long term innovations was deprioritized fir short term gain and the private sector didn’t do open innovation. Dec produced the pdp 8 previously computers were rented and software came installed but dec was too small to do this so it sold computers and let people tinker with the software the pdp 8 was a hit also Unix was becoming popular allowing for many to program their own computers and c was invented to work with Unix as a programming language giving power to the users Unix became the peoples operating system through open software with the pdp and later the Apple 2 the personal computing revolution had been kicked off

    - **Note:** At the beginning of the computer revolution it was unclear if walled gardens would win or open internet. Eventually open source won. Personal computing revolution. Empowering people. Luck was a visionary he saw the tech for what it could be because he was so close he could predict it well.
- Parc shipped a product but it didn’t fit the market place need the engineering guys had no idea what the business world needed and despite a 10 year headstart they got passed but many competitors and then the lab left for greener pastures like Apple and Microsoft. It was clear how much lick meant to people during his retirement when he got praise from Bob Taylor to current mit undergrads who just saw him as a professor throughout he always treated people right and was looked up to. At this time the nsf made their super computers available on a network that introduced all the smaller schools and non comp sci people to networking. This was a big step into making the internet more mainstream. The nsf net collapsed from usage and increased computers on the net by a factor of 10. And they also sped up the network from processing 75 mm packets to 1 bn packets a day then they boosted it again in 1991 they 30xed it again then al gore became a champion and fiber cables got laid connecting all networks
