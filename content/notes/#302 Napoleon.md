### Highlights

- "The World is a Very Malleable Place": A Quote from Mark and Driesen and how it Manifested in Napoleon's Life
  Key takeaways:
  - Mark and Driesen's quote about the malleability of the world can be applied to Napoleon and his ability to build his own reality
  - Napoleon believed luck was not a result of chance but rather the ability to exploit accidents, which he believed was a characteristic of genius
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  There's actually a quote from Mark and Driesen, which was one of my favorite quotes that I ever come across. I covered this back on episode 50. And this is what Mark's about to say here. Napoleon definitely would agree with. And I think the truth of this statement manifested in Napoleon's life. The world is a very malleable place. If you know what you want and you go for it with maximum energy and drive and passion, the world will often reconfigure itself around you much more quickly and easily than you would think. And so to that degree, not only did Napoleon build his own world, but he built his own reality. And so he has his own definitions of words. This is how what he considers luck. A consecutive series of great actions never is the result of chance and luck. It is always a product of planning and genius. Is it because they are lucky that great men become great? No, but being great, they have been able to master luck. What is luck? The ability to exploit accidents. The vulgar would call this luck. But in fact, it is the characteristic of genius when I got to that part. Maybe think of one of my favorite quotes from Ralph Waldo Emerson. He said, shallow men believe in luck. They believe in circumstances, strong men believe in cause and effect. Napoleon believed in cause and effect. Back to this idea about going after your life with maximum energy and drive and passion, hesitation is fatal. Once an action is begun, it must be followed through with the utmost exertion of the will. ([Time 0:07:51](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ed899149-08b7-4b61-bac8-668bca2ff86e))
    - **Note:** Shallow men believe in luck strong men believe in cause and effect. Napoleon believe everyone needs to live out and grasp their destiny. The world is a very malleable place.
- The Will and Ambition of Napoleon
  Key takeaways:
  - Once an action is begun, it must be followed through with the utmost exertion of the will
  - The importance of figuring out one's destiny
  - Identifying a handful of principles that are important and repeating them for decades
  - Napoleon's ambition for world empire and immortality
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Once an action is begun, it must be followed through with the utmost exertion of the will. And then a few pages later, he tells us what we should be directing our will at and that it is figuring out what your destiny is. If I have any ambition, it is so natural to me, so innate, so intimately linked with my existence that is like the blood that circulates in my veins. Like the air that I breathe, this guy has a way with words to aim at world empire seem to Napoleon a most natural thing. So something you and I have talked about in the past is this idea where the greatest founders, it's not like they have 100 different ideas. They identify a handful of principles. You see this over and over again, they identify a handful of principles that are important to them, important to the way to building your business, and they repeat them for decades. It's the same case for Napoleon. This is something that he's going to mention the first time that's mentioned. I don't know 15 times in this book that he's shooting for immortality. There is no immortality, but the memory that is left in the minds of men to have lived without glory without leaving a trace of one's existence is to have not lived at all. Remember that line because this is something that he's going to revisit. He uses different words, but that same idea to have lived without glory without leaving a trace of your existence is to have not lived at all. And then there's two quotes on this concept that you and I talk about all the time, which is founder mentality. Founder mentality is really these ideas. Like, I can start something that changes the world around me. ([Time 0:09:06](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f4166967-3e92-49f4-aa3e-73a4125938e0))
    - **Note:** To live without glory is to not have lived at all. Founder mentality seems to change the world around you.
- Napoleon's Advice: Listen Directly and Think for Yourself
  Key takeaways:
  - Napoleon's quotes are presented directly to the listener
  - Understanding a person can be achieved by listening directly to them
  - Napoleon encourages the listener to question why things are the way they are and think for themselves
  - Illusions can constrain one's thinking according to Napoleon
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And if there had never been anything but mediocre men, we would still be half apes. Okay, so that is the end of the introduction. And now we get into, from here on out, it's just quotes from Napoleon speaking directly to you and I. What I thought about is the, I just did, I think it was episode 299, that fantastic new book on Steve Jobs was put out by Steve, the Steve Jobs archive. And the forward of the introduction of that book was written by Steve Jobs widow, Lorraine Powell Jobs. And she said something, I think it might have been the first sentence in her introduction, that I thought was excellent. And she says the best way to understand a person is to listen to that person directly. That is what this book is for Napoleon. And so one thing Napoleon I think would tell you in eyes, ask why things are the way they are, and you need to think things through yourself. A few pages ago, he used the word illusions, that the things that you think are actually possible, like you're constrained by the by an illusion. And so he says, most sentiments are traditions, we experienced them because they have preceded us. And so his point there is you can go on copying tradition and just doing every whatever what previous generations have done over and over again, or you can actually create something new and think for yourself. A large part of the book is Napoleon breaking down various historical figures that he studied. In many cases, like, okay, I want this these traits from Alexander, or I don't want this trait from Charlemagne or whatever the case is. And one thing that he criticizes, like he would analyze other previous generals and their battle plans. ([Time 0:11:29](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7f463e44-d344-486e-8d49-39448fff0a1b))
    - **Note:** You can copy others or you can learn from them and arm yourself to think for yourself. Some people are too hesistant to act only talking. Men are guided by fear and self interest only. Appealing to self interest is also an idea from the advertising industry.
- The Power of Self-Interest in Advertising and Human Nature
  Key takeaways:
  - Men are guided by self-interest according to historical figures like Napoleon and advertising pioneers.
  - Appealing to a customer's self-interest is crucial in commercial settings.
  - Charlie Munger and Napoleon held a cynical view of human nature.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Men are moved by two lovers, only fear and self-interest. A few years later, he says the same thing. Men are guided by nothing else than self-interest. This is something the founders of the advertising industry, like Albert Lasker, Claude Hopkins, David Ogleville, a generation later realized. And this is something we can use in our commercial lives that you're wasting your time talking about your product, or you're talking about your company, you just appeal to interest. The customer only cares what your product does for them. Humans are guided by nothing else than self-interest. And then Napoleon shows us his view on human nature. There's a line I actually went back through my notes and read-wise. Because it's like I've heard- like there's the way Napoleon thinks. I would say it's very similar to this line about Charlie Munger and Cicero and poor Charlie's Almanac where he says his underlying philosophical view was one of deep and realistic cynicism about human nature. I think he believed that about other humans and himself, he says, I start out by believing the worst. I defy anyone to trick me. Men would have to be exceptional rascals, to be as bad as I assume them to be. And then he immediately demonstrates that this applies to himself as well. This is the thing about Napoleon. He is unapologetically extreme to maybe more than any other person I've ever read about. He says, my wife could have died and it would have not interfered for a quarter of an hour with the execution of my plans. ([Time 0:13:13](https://share.snipd.com/snip/33c19b3e-2768-4bf0-90d7-e8a22ec075fc))
    - **Note:** Unapologetically extreme. Go after your life with maximum energy drive and passion and impose your will on others and the world. The will to live and be willing to die for it.
- Napoleon's view on suicide and the will to live
  Key takeaways:
  - Napoleon believes that having a strong will to live is important and that suicide is the worst way to die.
  - He harshly criticizes suicide, stating that it is a mistake and a grave injustice towards oneself.
  - He believes that those who commit suicide are yielding to despair and weakness and sacrificing their entire future existence.
  - Napoleon emphasized that a life without purpose or direction is a dreadful monotony.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  The fact that you go after life with maximum energy and drive and passion, you actually impose your will on the world. He says one must have the will to live and be willing to die. And he talks about, this is actually interesting because I'm reading another biography of Anthony Bourdain who obviously committed suicide. And this is something that Napoleon mentions a bunch that it's a mistake. No matter what, essentially the mistake of suicide and we go back to his the way he has with words. The man who kills himself on Monday night might wish to live on Saturday. And yet one kills oneself only once. The man who breaking down under the weight of present evils ends his life commits a grave injustice towards himself and yields to despair and weakness to a momentary mood at the expense of his entire future existence. So suicide to Napoleon is the worst way to die. This is the worst way to live. When on rising from sleep, a man does not know what to do with himself and drags his tedious existence from place to place. When scanning his future he sees nothing but dreadful monotony, one day resembling the next. When he asks himself, why do I exist? Then in my opinion, he is the most wretched of all. And then he goes back to some of his favorite themes on immortality, on life, destiny, will, greatness. ([Time 0:15:20](https://share.snipd.com/snip/70fb1e2d-3ca1-4833-ab9a-0c44f3a25da7))
    - **Note:** Suicide he views as a bad way to go that you need to go out on your sword. There is nothing worse to him than stumbling through life without a meaning or purpose doing this is a waste of life. Live with glory and leave a trace of yourself. Charlie munger - don’t be timid go at life with a little courage.
- The Importance of Legacy and Destiny from Steve Jobs' Perspective
  Key takeaways:
  - Steve Jobs wanted to be remembered alongside other greats like Edwin Lann, Bill Hewlett, and David Packard. Hewlett and Packard were long dead, yet their legacies lived on.
  - Napoleon believed that a person's destiny is crucial, and men of genius are meteors destined to be consumed in lighting up their century.
  - Destiny must be fulfilled, and it is a chief doctrine that one must sacrifice everything, including comfort and happiness, to achieve it.
  - Knowing oneself is key to tying in destiny with immortality, such as when Napoleon relates his ambition to the blood in his veins and the air he breathes.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  He wanted to be in the pantheon with and indeed a notch above people like Edwin Lann, Bill Hewlett and David Packard and what did land Hewlett and Packard have in common at the time that Steve Jobs was still alive when Isaacson was writing that. It's that they were long dead and people were still talking about the legacy they left behind. Go back to what Napoleon just told us everything on Earth is soon forgotten except the opinion we leave imprinted on history. Napoleon is going to keep repeating. You've got to find out what your destiny is and then do everything you can to fulfill it. Men of genius are meteors destined to be consumed in lighting up their century. A man cannot excel unless he is of a unique cast. All my life I have sacrificed everything comfort self-interest happiness to my destiny. Destiny must be fulfilled. That is my chief doctrine. And then he goes back to tying in destiny with immortality. And again, this comes from knowing yourself. When he said earlier in the book, he's like, you know, my ambition is like the blood in my veins and the air I breathe. It's just who I am. It's a natural part of me. I don't even notice its existence. It is not enough for him to exist. He must also be known. He must know himself until then all endeavors are in vain. All schemes will collapse. And so something that you and I have in common with Napoleon is that we spend an excessive amount of time studying great people from history. ([Time 0:18:18](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b3676fc7-f4c5-4a4c-8b74-1ff69a5131dd))
    - **Note:** Sacrifice everything in pursuit of your destiny to achieve immortality. Study the great people then want to become them.
- Washington's View of American Revolution and British Superiority
  Key takeaways:
  - The speaker constantly rereads past material and looks for connections to current readings.
  - Washington saw the American Revolution as a struggle for power and victory would destroy British superiority.
  - Washington had seen examples before the war that contradicted British marketing of superiority.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I'm constantly rereading them and trying to figure out how stuff we knew and I've discussed in the past and that I've read in the past connects to what we're like the book that I have in my hand. When I got to this section, I was like, you know what? That made me think of that is Napoleon's describing the British view of Washington and America. Well, what was Washington's view, an America's view of the British? On this note, when I read this, you know, I don't know a year ago or whatever it was, I wrote Washington was a badass. And so it says, one of Washington's biographers captured his view, Washington's view of the American Revolution. This is excellent. Essentially, he saw the conflict as a struggle for power in which the colonists, if victorious, destroyed British pretensions of superiority and won control over half a continent. What a line. And that's the crazy thing is there was examples, I think it was like two decades before that this actual war where Washington had realized, wait, the marketing of British superiority is not matching up with what I'm actually seeing them in the battlefield because they were trying to fight. Washington was actually helping the British fight the Native Americans in that in that actual story in the book. And he just realized, thinking, hey, maybe there actually there is a weakness here and then we can actually attack that weakness. And think about that, it is a struggle for power in which if we are victorious, ([Time 0:21:23](https://share.snipd.com/snip/85d43cdb-63f7-4423-8a55-771b8f971248))
    - **Note:** Washington saw the revolution as an opportunity to destroy brittish pertensions of superiority and take control of half the world. He saw England was weak from his French and Indian days and realized his young upstart could seriously challange them. Success is what makes a great man. Lbj- take advantage of every opportunity that’s how you achieve and realize greatness. The less clever man by neglecting one thing misses everything.
- Insights on Opportunity, Imagination, and Ambition from Napoleon
  Summary:
  Napoleon emphasizes the importance of being opportunity-driven, adapting to circumstances rather than controlling them, and constantly changing plans.
  He highlights the power of imagination in shaping one's beliefs and ambitions, as well as the relentless nature of true ambition that drives individuals like himself. Napoleon also stresses the significance of learning from history, pointing out that true learning involves changing behavior, not just memorizing information.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  He says that we are individual opportunity driven. We see Napoleon echoing that same sentiment here. I had very few definitive ideas. And the reason for this was that instead of seeking to control circumstances, I obeyed them. And they forced me to change my mind all the time. Most of the time I had no definitive plans, but only projects. This is one of my favorite lines in the entire book. This line is actually related to the next line where he's describing Alexander. The first line is imagination rules the world. Couple like a paragraph later, he's describing Alexander. He says, Alexander believes himself a God and he wants to make others believe it. And that notion came from Alexander's imagination, imagination rules the world. Now we get into his Napoleon's definition of ambition. And really, after I finished reading the entire book, I went back, I always go through my highlights and read them multiple times. And then I started updating notes with the context of everything that's going to come in the future from the book. And I was like, Oh, he's describing himself here. He could never quit ambition, which overthrows governments and private fortunes, which feeds on blood and crimes. Ambition is a violent and unthinking fever that ceases only when life ceases. That is Napoleon's description of Napoleon. There is only one thing to do in this world. And that is to keep acquiring more and more money and power. And Napoleon spends a lot of time talking about history. Essentially, what he's telling us is that humans don't learn from history. It's the rare few that actually can change their behavior. Because again, learning is not just memorizing information, learning changing behavior. And so Napoleon says, nation and individuals alike learn only from their own experience. ([Time 0:23:57](https://share.snipd.com/snip/79ba075f-4b4b-4d8f-9351-3c6f50861ded))
    - **Note:** Ambition rules the world. You need to build your future in your mind positive visualization then have the action to take that idealized future. Humans don’t learn from history learning requires they change behavior and update beliefs based on new information
- Napoleon's Analysis of Historical Figures and Lessons for Action
  Key takeaways:
  - Napoleon's actions were deeply calculated and managed wisely
  - Napoleon found St. Louis's lack of action unbearable and emphasized the importance of thinking as a step to action
  - Napoleon admired Frederick the Great and praised his ability to handle crises
  - Studying history's greatest founders is like studying the birth of industries
  - Napoleon believed a revolution could not be made or stopped
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Everything he did was calculated deeply carried out audaciously and managed wisely. And then he goes right into analyzing St. Louis. And he's like, Oh, I don't want to do it. This guy remember the introduction says that to Napoleon's mind in action was unbearable. And so he says St. Louis spent eight months praying when he should have spent them marching, fighting and consolidating his hold over his country. In other words, he wasn't using his thinking as a step to action goes into Frederick the Great, mentions them a couple times. Again, more Napoleon learning from history on Frederick the Great. I think that he is one of those who knew their business best in all respects. Frederick was great above all at moments of great crises. This is the highest praise that can be given. And then he has a great line where he's speaking about the French Revolution, but I think this applies for your for what our purposes, right? Studying history's greatest founders is in many cases, studying like the birth of industries. And so when I read Napoleon say this, a revolution could be neither made nor stopped. A revolution could be neither made nor stopped. The only thing that can be done is for one or several of its children to give it a direction. I think of commercial revolutions, things that you and I've studied, like the birth of the internet, the birth of human powered flight, the birth of mass produced automobiles with internal combustion engines. These were revolutions that could be neither made nor stopped. ([Time 0:26:33](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f66d13ad-7a70-4131-9ee3-c5ea96d8b8e7))
    - **Note:** A revolution can neither be made nor stopped it’s only up to people to provide a direction. Riding the wave of technology and having agency to influence the future. You can slow progress but you can destroy it.
- The Hypocrisy of Napoleon: Contradictions in His Legacy
  Key takeaways:
  - The book highlights Napoleon's humanity and the contradictions present in all humans.
  - The editor does a great job in showing how Napoleon contradicted himself over time.
  - Napoleon stated in 1806 that he did not want censorship of books, but by 1810 he had established book censorship.
  - This shows how thoughts can lead to action.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Another benefit of reading this book is that you see that Napoleon, for his legacy, for the fact that he has talked about hundreds of years after he died, he was human. And all humans are full of hypocrisy and contradictions. And the editor of the book does a fantastic job of having Napoleon say something emphatically. And then two years later, because all the quotes have the year in which he said it or he wrote it. And he realizes like, oh, he just contradicted himself. We are all full of hypocrisy and contradictions in 1806. He said, I say it once more. I do not want any censorship of books, because every bookseller is made responsible for the work that he sells, because I do not wish to take the responsibility for every nonsense that comes off the printing press. And finally, because I do not want some clerk to tyrannize over the mind and to mutilate genius. And there is a footnote at the bottom of this page in 1810. However, Napoleon did establish book censorship. And then we see another example of a thought, an idea leading to action, this thought that, hey, most of what human behavior is, it's just traditions that if you actually stop and ask, like, why are things like this, do you realize a lot of the limits that you have are illusions? And, you know, he thinks on an unbelievably grand scale, he really just makes you think bigger, that you just realize that you don't have any limits and then life can be built to your specifications. ([Time 0:28:16](https://share.snipd.com/snip/959674d7-7629-4ac8-9f2a-f958969be068))
    - **Note:** Most humans are guided by tradition and when you step back and look you realize you don’t have those limitation you thought society imposed on you.
- The Importance of Information Control in Leadership
  Key takeaways:
  - Napoleon and Steve Jobs demonstrated with actions how important it was to have complete control over information flow
  - Napoleon served as his own minister of propaganda by dictating important army bulletins himself
  - Human nature shows that unlimited power leads to a desire to control information flow
  - Steve Jobs was known to approve every external piece of marketing communication before release
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And so Napoleon and Steve was demonstrating with actions how important it was because there was a book I read, I think it's called Insanely Simple. It was written by a guy that actually worked on the advertising and reported directly Steve. And he says like, there wouldn't be a billboard in Missouri coming out without Steve Jobs approving it in himself. Like literally saying, he's like, I'm seeing every single external piece of marketing communication to our customers before it goes through and I'm going to approve it. We see Napoleon doing something similar to like this. Napoleon dictated all important army bulletins himself. Their purpose was multiple to inform the public, to counter ruin your rumors, to mislead the enemy and to stir up enthusiasm. He served as his own minister of propaganda. The difference being once you go down that path and you're the sovereign nation, you just got to have complete control. This is just something that reappears over in human nature. It's never going to stop. If you give somebody unlimited power, they're going to want to control the information flow. And we see this in the early 1800s, when Napoleon was being shaved, I used to read the newspapers to him. I would always begin with the French papers. Skip it, skip it, he used to say when I read the French papers, I know what's in them. They only say what I tell them to. And so this idea that Napoleon was a micromanager reappears in multiple cases, he's talking about the propaganda aspect he micromanaged. ([Time 0:31:24](https://share.snipd.com/snip/38f02e35-409c-4555-9926-39a837ec110c))
    - **Note:** Napoleon controlled the message through propaganda this is the importance of marketing and having your message be heard.
- Napoleon's Psychological Warfare on his Troops
  Key takeaways:
  - Napoleon believed in the power of morale of his troops and spent a lot of time communicating with them.
  - He was unable to leave even trivial details to others.
  - Napoleon's extreme behavior during war is shown in a particular example where he called the burning of a city a beautiful sight and said that the corpse of an enemy always smells sweet.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Okay. And it's like, he's got a million things to worry about. And again, I think the editor nailed it here. Napoleon's inability to leave even the most trivial detail to others. And so when you study Napoleon, something that pops up a lot, he just spent so much time communicating with his troops. And I think one of the reasons is because he really does believe how powerful the mind is, the morale of your troops who are either strong and victorious are weak and beaten, depending on which they think they will be. So he spends an unbelievable amount of time sharing information with them and really guiding what they think. And it is in the war section that we get just how extreme, I don't know if he's psychopath or what you want to call it, but this is an example that Napoleon while watching the city burn says it's like Vesuvius erupting. Don't you think this is a beautiful sight and the person standing next to him says this is horrible sire. And this is a Napoleon's response. But remember, gentlemen, the corpse of an enemy always smells sweet. There's just one story he's telling me is he's just walking past thousands of dead corpses. And yet there's an injured dog. And he's like, what is wrong with me? Like I'm brought to tears and agony over this injured dog. And I didn't even weep or think twice about passing all these dead humans. And I bring that up and I want to repeat that because I think it's really important to understand like you and I are right now we're studying one of the most extreme people that have ever lived. And he was extreme in mindset and action. ([Time 0:34:06](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a866d8cf-982b-4bb1-9bff-dbf5d55bfc54))
    - **Note:** Napoleon was extreme and didn’t care about the dead people. He also closely controlled the message his soldiers heard and fed them what he thought was the best message to achieve victory. Great motivator using many medals and honors. People want to be celebrated and noticed.
- Napoleon's disregard for rules: The conversation with General Mack
  Key takeaways:
  - Napoleon believed that rules did not apply to him and only applied to other people
  - Napoleon did not recognize Switzerland's neutrality and believed he had a right to enter its territory
  - General Mack had a poor understanding of human nature and psychology
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And so part of this extreme way that that Napoleon went out of life is he just goes back to this idea. It's like the rules are just words written down on paper. And they apply to other people and they do not apply to me. And I'm going to tie this with something else that I learned as well. So in this section, he's having a conversation with this guy named General Mack. General Mack was a commander of this Austrian forces that just surrendered to Napoleon. And so they're having this conversation and Mack says to Napoleon, it is said that your majesty has troops marching through Switzerland, whose neutrality we have respected. So Switzerland is supposed to be a neutral country that has agreed upon. You're just violating their neutrality. We refuse to do that, right? And so other words, saying you're not fighting fair, which this guy had a really poor understanding of human nature and the psychology of humans. Napoleon responds, I have not recognized his neutrality. Consequently, I have a right to enter its territory. Again, other rules don't apply. Their rules are for other people that are not for Napoleon. Mack, ah, we were always the dupes of our good faith. And then he continues that Napoleon not only violated the neutrality of Switzerland, he also did it for Prussia, which gave him an advantage in this battle against Mack. He says your majesty had also violated neutrality of Prussia, thus gaining eight days in affecting the junction of your forces. ([Time 0:35:57](https://share.snipd.com/snip/79f531f4-3e09-4ed4-baef-054d6ecd268f))
    - **Note:** Rules allly to other people not Napoleon who didn’t believe in society’s convention.
- Lessons on Understanding Human Psychology from Robert Caro's Work
  Key takeaways:
  - Understanding human psychology is important to avoid detrimental consequences.
  - Robert Caro profiled Napoleon and Lyndon Johnson who sacrificed everything to reach the top.
  - Those who are not willing to pay the price of success will likely be surpassed by those who are.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  But Sam Hinky is the one that turned me on to like really push me to read Caro. I had read the power broker, but I had never gotten to Caro's multiple parts series on Lyndon Johnson. And he said something in this interview that, in this podcast, that I wrote down. And I really think applies to what is this story with General Mack, misunderstanding human psychology to the detriment. He's lucky he's alive. This misunderstanding could have killed him. This is why it's so important to understand humans as they actually are, not as we want them to be. So Sam says, Robert Caro, the author of the power broker in the four part series, hopefully five part series on Lyndon Johnson, right? Robert Caro profiled two men whose seeds were not high in the tournament of life. Napoleon's seed was not high. They were without many advantages. And to get all the way to the top, you probably had to sacrifice everything to that effort. The meta lesson is if you are not willing to pay that price, presume someone else will. General Mack was not willing to pay that price. Napoleon was. Sam continues. If you want something like the presidency, and then I wrote or being a billionaire or building a very valuable company, you should presume there is someone out there who will devote all their time, money, relationships, sense of ethics. Is that not what we're where we are in the book? ([Time 0:38:48](https://share.snipd.com/snip/59d03b11-70bb-47c3-9a2a-cd7eef72a671))
    - **Note:** People will devote everything to achieve a place they want in life and sacrifice everything. See human nature not as you think it should be but as it is. Commit their entire life and sense of ethics to this one goal.
- Napoleon's maxims on strategy, the value of thoughts and his idea of 'squareness'
  Key takeaways:

  Get into some of Napoleon's maxims for this is the art of war. At the beginning of a campaign, much thought should be given to whether a strategy is to be adopted. However, once the offensive has started, it must be sustained to the last extremity. So that's another example of this idea for him. Thoughts are only valuable to the degree that they lead to actions. This is going to remind me of Steve Jobs. This is something that Napoleon repeated. The ancients had a great advantage over us in that their armies were not trailed by a second army of pen pushers. And so this is about Napoleon's notion of this ideal he called a squareness. So squareness is actually an equilibrium of intellect and character. His definition of character would be physical courage, as well as perseverance and daring.

- Learning from Military History and the Great Captains for Business Success
  Summary:
  The key insight is that war consists of accidents and commanders should pay attention to details to exploit these accidents, often referred to as luck but actually a sign of genius.
  Success in battle can be determined by the smallest circumstances. Learning to be a great general, or in entrepreneurship, involves studying military history and the battles of great captains for acquiring knowledge of grand principles.
  There are no fixed rules, as everything depends on an individual's character.
  The principles of warfare are learned from studying great captains like Alexander, Hannibal, and Caesar, whose campaigns provide a comprehensive guide to the art of war.
  These principles are valuable for both defensive and offensive warfare.

  And this is part of the reason why war consists of nothing but accidents, and that a commander should never overlook anything that might enable him to exploit these accidents. The vulgar call this luck, but in fact, is a characteristic of genius back to this idea of paying attention to the tiniest details. Sometimes a single battle decides everything. And sometimes too, the slightest circumstance decides the battle. Little things are big things is how I would summarize what he's saying there. This he's talking about how do you learn how to be a great general, really what he's saying here. I wrote same with entrepreneurship. Knowledge of the grand principles of warfare can be acquired only through the study of military history and of battles of the great captains and through experience. So you and I are doing this for business, right? There are no precise determinant rules. Everything depends on the character that nature has bestowed on the individual. That is so good. Knowledge of the grand principles of warfare can be acquired only through the study of military history and of the battles of the great captains and through experience. Obviously, you and I using that for metaphor. There are no precise determinant rules. Everything depends on the character that nature has bestowed on the individual. People are power law and the best ones can change everything. And then he describes his personal historical curriculum. The principles of warfare are those which guided the great captains whose high deeds history has transmitted to us. Alexander Hannibal Caesar names a bunch of other ones, Frederick the Great, the history of their 83 campaigns would constitute a complete treatise on the art of war. The principles that must be followed in defensive and offensive warfare would flow from it as from a common source. And so then he talks about not only is he learning from these people, but they learn from each other. ([Time 0:44:43](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d16af7a9-d64a-4b27-9c1c-0b1f9fe1cb5c))

  The principles of warfare are those which guided the great captains whose high deeds history has transmitted to us. Alexander Hannibal Caesar names a bunch of other ones, Frederick the Great, the history of their 83 campaigns would constitute a complete treatise on the art of war. The principles that must be followed in defensive and offensive warfare would flow from it as from a common source. And so then he talks about not only is he learning from these people, but they learn from each other. Caesar's principles were the same as Alexander's and Hannibal's to keep his forces united, to be vulnerable at no point, to strike speedily at critical points, to make use of every possible opportunity of increasing his chances of victory on the battlefield. Think about it. Let me pause right there. To make use of every possible opportunity of increasing his chances of victory on the battlefield. Do everything and you will win. That maximum pops up over and over again in the book. That's another way of him saying the same thing to make use of every possible opportunity of increasing your chances for victory. Caesar took great risks in the adventures into which he was pushed by his boldness. His genius got him out of his difficulties. He was a man whose genius and boldness were equally great. So that's another example of this, this idea of squareness, this equilibrium of two valuable traits that Napoleon seemed to admire and value. He's running through all these anecdotes on all these historical people. This is in the art of war section of the book of all what he learned from studying. ([Time 0:45:58](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f71ae94c-690f-45ab-ba93-7dc4296cdbc7))
    - **Note:** Squareness is the idea of well balanced personality. Caesar had equal parts genius and boldness. Timid when planning his campaigns understanding the biggest risks but bold once the plan is hatched and put into action. Be hard to kill avoid wipe. First don’t lose then win. Watch your costs and expenses the cause of death is running out of money.

  Speaker 1
  End of his life, he's going back and trying to figure out like he surveys his career. And he's talking about like how he's going to be remembered in history. I'm going to read you the paragraph and I'm going to my mate one of my main takeaways from the book or reoccurring thought I had when I was going to the book. It will be argued at length whether my absolute authority and my arbitrary actions were the effect of my character or my of my calculations, whether they were caused by my inclination or by force of circumstance, whether I waged constant warfare. That's one way to put it in wage constant warfare. We just said that other books that he did more battles and what Caesar Hannibal and Alexander combined, whether I wage constant warfare to indulge my personal taste or whether I was pushed into it against my will, whether my immense ambition was spurred by lust for power or thirst for glory or for the necessity of establishing order or my love of general warfare. And it's when I get to this page and I had reread all of my highlights and I'm almost at the end of the book and I realized it's like, okay, this is my main takeaway from spending time with Napoleon, right? Because it's like to hold this book in your hand is to literally go into his mind and live there for, you know, it took me eight days to really absorb this book. And it's not that long. It's just really trying to think about what the hell he's trying to convey to us. And so my main takeaway from spending all this time with Napoleon is like, whatever you do, do it constantly and massively increase. This is a note to myself. Whatever you do, do it constantly and massively increase the scope of your ambition. As I was reading this book, I was constantly thinking I'm not doing enough. He goes back to this idea that winning is winning solves everything. Winning is the main thing and that you need to keep the main thing the main thing. ([Time 0:49:58](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b4502052-20c2-49ea-8458-9d9d466722c2))
    - **Note:** Whatever you’re doing do it constantly and massively increase your ambition. Remain focused and keep the main thing the main thing. Sacrifice everything for victory needed to fill his destiny ambition is all consuming.
