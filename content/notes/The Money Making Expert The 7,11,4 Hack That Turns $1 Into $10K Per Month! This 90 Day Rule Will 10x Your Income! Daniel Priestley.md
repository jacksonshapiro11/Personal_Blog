  Yeah. So the five P is we have to learn to pitch, right? The entrepreneur journey is a journey of 1,000 pitches. One way or another, you're either going to pitch an average pitch and end up with nothing or you pitch a phenomenal pitch and end up with a $10 million to $100 million business. If you're Elon Musk, you'll end up pitching your way to Mars, right? But the entrepreneur journey is all about pitching. So we've got to have a great way of pitching the business so people are excited. In person or digitally? Could be video, right? I've seen Mark Zuckerberg do hundreds of pitches over the last 20 years for Facebook and new features. Steve Jobs used to do it on stage, but then the video went out. So you can do it to video, you can do it to camera, you can do it on a podcast, you can do it live, you can do it one to one, you can do it to groups, but you have to learn how to be able to pitch an Idea, get people excited about something through your words. Entrepreneurs and founders, they are the spokesperson for their business, they have to be able to be good at pitching. The second thing is publishing content, publishing videos, publishing podcasts, publishing a book, publishing on LinkedIn, right? So it's essentially taking the elements of a pitch, but putting into different formats. 7-11 stuff. The third element is the productization, the product ecosystem. Too many people sell time and skills. They have to sell intellectual property, media, data, software, or productized services. They have to have a scalable product, something that doesn't require their time and effort in order to sell it again and again, because your time and effort as a founder has to be on the Demand side, not the supply side. So we've got to productize. Raising profile is the next one. So having your social media platforms, doing some live events, um, winning some awards, uh, getting on traditional media or third party platforms, all of that is your profile. And then the next one, once you've done all of that is doing your first joint ventures and partnerships. So big business happens when you can find the right partners. Uh, so you might need a capital partner for investment, or you might need a distribution partner for sales. You might need a product partner, someone who actually partners to incorporate something that they do into your product. So you're packaging up through partnerships. So I always focus people on pitching, publishing, product profile partnerships. That's the role of the founder. We call that the key person of influence role. Personal brand feels like this weird thing, or it feels like branding, or it feels like this kind of like, oh, I've got to, you know, get up every day and photograph my breakfast and, you Know, all that sort of stuff. But actually, if we just focus on pitch, publish, product profile partnership, most people who are sensible people with successful businesses, they say, oh, that makes sense. I like all of those things. Yeah. Personal branding has got a bit of a rap, isn't it? A bit of a stigma. The goal is not to be an influencer, to be a key person of influence. And there's a difference.

  And I think there's different types of personal branding. And the best, most effective type of personal branding that I've seen is what I call idea promotion, where you're promoting your ideas to the world, maybe in a particular niche or industry. But it's all about here are my ideas. ([TimeÂ 1:54:16](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ce711b40-ae5a-40dd-9106-085c715a6643))
