  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  It was the middle of the week and I was in Atlanta working. My phone rang and it was my father calling. He said that he was calling to tell me that he was selling a large chunk of the company. I couldn't believe it. I was stunned. I tried to talk him out of it. I told him that the company was doing well and there was no doubt in my mind that we could make our debt payments. When it was clear I wasn't getting anywhere my shock gave way to anger and I said, dad all of my life you taught me to work hard and not to be a quitter and now you're the one who's quitting. What happened to you? How could you do this? Dad remained surprisingly calm and unmoved. I hung up the phone, dazed and disappointed. Just a few days later I got another call but this time it was my stepmother. Dad was dead. After having a relaxing breakfast my father walked up to his bathroom, climbed into the tub and shot himself. I never thought it would come to this. I had lost my best friend. That is an insane excerpt from the book I'm going to talk to you about today which is Ted Turner's autobiography. It is called Call Me Ted. I want to start a few years before his father's suicide. Ted is around. This is an insane story. There's so much that's going on that happens in this book. Ted is around 24-25 years old when his dad kills himself. ([Time 0:07:23](https://share.snipd.com/snip/aa8b5a9c-fca2-4aad-a1fe-3976a3b076fb))
    - **Note:** Ted’s dad was a depression child he got so rich and had everything he wanted but wasn’t happy. He drinks and uses drugs eventually kills humself when Ted is 25. Having enough. Ted takes over a 15mm outdoor billboard company sells it for 8bn 40 years later. He’s a workaholic early to bed early to rise work like hell and advertise. First in last to leave to earn the workers respect. He had a complicated relationship with his dad. Best friends but also fought often.
- Using stock to minimize taxes and finance acquisitions
  Key takeaways:
  - Ted Turner used alternative methods like offering stock instead of cash to avoid heavy tax rates.
  - Ted Turner was acquisitive and constantly sought to expand his business ventures.
  - Ted Turner faced a cash problem when he wanted to purchase a profitable billboard company in Chattanooga, Tennessee for one million dollars.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  He makes a lot of income at this point in American history. The top he was at the highest bracket like income tax bracket. And so at this point he's like well if I pay you 200 grand in cash that's taxed at a 90 percent rate. So you wind up with what $20,000 and the government, the US government gets 180,000. Obviously you don't want to do that because this is being treated as a short term capital game. And therefore it's taxes ordinary income. Right? And so he goes well what if I actually give you stock in Turner advertising which is the company that he inherited from his dad. And then that way you can hold the equity as long as you need to to shield yourself from any heavy tax that you would get on a short term game gain. And Bob's like okay I accept that offer. So I want to jump to another example where Ted always has to get really creative when he's financing these deals and something to know about him. He's acquisitive by nature. If he has you know billboards in Georgia he wants to expand into Tennessee. If he has billboards he wants to get into radio. If he has billboards on radio he wants to get into billboards radio and TV. If he starts buying the Atlanta Braves then he wants to also own the Atlanta Hawks. This is something he does his entire life. He's very very acquisitive. At this point he says I'm eager to expand. I found a very profitable billboard company in Chattanooga, Tennessee. But the price was a million dollars. Great. I'll buy it. Here's the problem. I didn't have that kind of cash. ([Time 0:17:55](https://share.snipd.com/snip/96e9438e-aa77-42c8-b866-baddd6bbe1b8))
    - **Note:** Ted’s dad agrees to sell the business the day before he kills himself. Ted goes to the guy he sold it to asking to rip up the contract he refuses so Ted starts promoted leases and renegotiating the ad space which is the key asset of the company. The other guy caves and says he will divest for 200k. Ted doesn’t have the money but taxes were 90% so he gives him stock they agree and move on. High agency viewing problems as obstacles solving creatively. He is very acquisitive and combines his assets in ways others can’t or don’t. He owns radio and billboard both advertising so he uses the same tactics but also 15% of billboards go unsold so he uses that as free advertising expands his reach and buys up the competition. He then does this with tv. Takes ideas from one industry and transfers it to others and pushes his advantage. He thinks tv is the future believes in the power of tv to reach people so he focuses there over radio.

  - The speaker approaches the club president as a partner

  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And so he winds up being the one he bids on and he winds up broadcasting all the Atlanta Braves baseball games. And so this is an idea that you and I've talked about over and over again, the fact that relationships run the world. This is how he winds up buying the Atlanta Braves and why. Remember, his channel is the one that carries the Braves games. And so he's like, listen, the ratings for the local Atlanta Braves games, I think is the highest thing highest rated show that he has on his TV network, or his TV station rather, right? But the problem is like that fluctuates whether the team is winning or losing to wins more games. Obviously, more people tune in, right? And so he goes to the president of the club. His name is Danny's like, Dan, I consider us to be partners. We need to add some more excitement next year. What are you going to do to get the team on track? And Dan tells him, well, I'm not gonna do anything because I'm gonna sell the team. And Ted's freaking out. I was like, what are you talking about? Who are you gonna sell to? And Dan says, I'm gonna sell it to you. And the reason I say relationships run the world is because one, it's in these book and over you see this in these biographies over and over again. But it's also something that his dad told him a long time ago. He says, my dad taught me early on that long term relationships with your customers and partners are very important. You never know how the guy who you're friendly with today might be able to help you tomorrow. And so what's happening? He's like, they're offering me a first look chance to buy the franchise. And this is another example where Ted does not have the money. And this is what he says. It's like, it doesn't matter. I don't have any money. ([Time 0:28:30](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2a84b918-eeaa-4934-a916-b2135ab97409))
    - **Note:** Importance of positioning he buys the only other tv network in Atlanta at that point tv was local. Then he strikes long term deals with studios to air movies on them because there is no competition and the studios don’t value the assets that much for tv. He is also broadcasting braves games and relationships run the world. The owner of the braves gives Ted the first look to buy them. Ted agrees then has to find the money. Saw value in sports early + tv as the future. He buys it for 10mm paid over 10 years at an interest rate. Ted was impervious to road blocks. Ted sees the future is tv and he’s trying to work with cable operators at the same time most are living in fear of them. He creates tbs which people didn’t understand so he couldn’t finance it or advertise on it so he invented direct advertising like Billy mays. Ted saw the future and power of tv before anyone. Sees the idea for hbo and satalite movies with worldwide distribution he’s living in the future.

  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I think one of his biggest secrets of success over the years is that the things that most of us would sit there and ponder all these regulatory and legal reasons why it might not be something You could do. And Ted would just say, oh hell, you can overcome those kind of things. And he just go and do it. And so he's making enemies everywhere. He's fighting with, he's like, we managed to alienate the Hollywood studios, the sports leagues, the broadcast networks, and the local stations all over the country. And so he has to fight this actually in Washington. There's going to be a bunch of lawsuits, a bunch of regulations. This is what I mean. He's going to describe what he did. This is one of the most difficult periods of his life. But this also speaks to this obsessive, workaholic nature that he has. There is a bunch of stuff in the book about his childhood, which was crazy about the way he went through multiple divorces, talks about, you know, wasn't really around when his kids were There. If you're interested in that, I'm going to skip over that from, I want to focus on really how he built his business. But there is a lot of that in the book and it's well worth reading. But this he's describing the hardest part of the period of his life. These issues were all unchartered territory. All of us, the regulators, the broadcasters, the program suppliers, and the leagues, the sports leagues, were sorting things out on the fly. I was working as hard as I could. I'd go all out during the day working on sales, distribution, regulatory issues, whatever the battle happened to be. ([Time 0:35:52](https://share.snipd.com/snip/edddad9e-5374-4599-8ae0-56b953e82ed4))
    - **Note:** He gets divorced multiple times has a bad relationship with his kids. He’s basically making a new industry and gets in fights with the sports leagues and movie studios. Basically picked a fight with everyone. He slept in the office and is just trying to solve constant problems. He’s not worried about regulation or anything he’s just trying to continue to push the ball forward and jump through the hoops he has to to do so. He’s always paying attention and always adapting. He started shows past the hour which no one else did and this allowed people to see a show when all the other channels were at commercial. This super channel concept was so new they couldn’t even advertise only once his competitors followed him did it materialize. He brought black and white movies to color and this cost 200k but 6x viewers constantly expanding.
- The Visionary Founder and his Belief in 24 Hour Cable News
  Key takeaways:
  - A satellite news station broadcasting sports, movies, and news worldwide 24/7 was proposed by the speaker in 1976.
  - The speaker is an avid reader, particularly interested in history and biographies.
  - The viability of a 24-hour news or cable news station was not formally researched, but the speaker had been thinking about it for over five years.
  - The speaker's belief in cable as a medium for news was strong and he was passionate about it, even facing opposition and disbelief from others.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I'm going to put this station up on a satellite, and I'm going to get a news thing going. Sports, movies and news 24 hours a day all over the world. He said that in 1976. That is incredible. I haven't even mentioned yet the fact that this guy is a voracious reader. And you already know before I say this to you, what do you think he's reading? What do you think he's reading? You know what he's reading? He's reading history. He's reading biographies. He's constantly. I don't know if I'm going to there's some highlights on this, but he's constantly comparing stuff he read in books like from history to what's taking place in his in his life. And I love this part. He's like, I'm often asked if we ever did any formal research on the viability of a 24 hour news or 24 hour cable news station. And my answer is no. I had spent over five years thinking about it. Henry Ford didn't need focus groups to tell him that people would prefer inexpensive dependable automobiles over horses. Alexander Graham Bell never stopped to worry about whether people would prefer speaking to each other on a phone. If viewers liked watching news on television, why wouldn't they want the option to do it any hour of the day? And so when I say that I think the highest order bit is his belief in cable, and I can prove to you that he believed it because you have all these people saying that Turner was literally jumping Up on desks and people were like literally like screaming that people didn't understand what he saw. ([Time 0:45:04](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6498bd99-0a87-4436-92c9-6fc3fd9cc1fb))
    - **Note:** He took 5 years to launch cnn 24 hour news he read biographies voracious. He had a deep belief in cable that his competitors didn’t have and he was just riding that wave. Believed he’d be a billionaire. He launched without sufficient capital and starts selling his most expensive and least strategic assets to fund cnn. It’s a bet the company bet. It was so new no one would finance it. He fought bigger competitors constantly but they had less desire Ted had to win. He has a burn the boats strategy he takes rommels strategy in North Africa when he didn’t have enough fuel he capture strategic British fuel reserves Ted does this by getting through year 1 as proof of concept to then raise more capital. Ted is a great salesmen and hypnotizes people with his self belief and charm and he needs to win.
- Ted Turner's Attempt to Merge Turner Broadcasting: A Look into His Business Strategy
  Key takeaways:
  - The network stayed on the sidelines and watched the launch of other cable channels, which included TBS, ESPN, HBO, MTV, Nickelodeon, and the Discovery Channel.
  - Ted's hypothesis was that the innovators of lemma were more concerned about ratings and short-term profits than the long-term future of their business.
  - Ted Turner consistently tried to merge Turner broadcasting with larger companies, despite it not aligning with his personality.
  - Ted Turner's goal was to merge Turner broadcasting with one of the big three networks, specifically focusing on the news aspect of it.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  That's obvious to you that no one else sees. So he says to my continued amazement, the network stayed on the sidelines and watched the launch of other cable channels. So not only did you have his TBS, the Superstation, you have ESPN, you have HBO, you have all this other these other experiments, you're seeing things like MTV, Nickelodeon, the Discovery Channel. And his hypothesis, Ted's hypothesis about why this was happening is saying it's almost like the innovators of lemma. They were worrying more about the previous night's ratings and the money that comes from that than the long term future of their business. And so he keeps trying to merge Turner broadcasting with this is this is again, just how how this whole thing ends up when he tries to merge later on with GE and he's having this conversation With Jack Welch. The note of myself, but there's not even a highlight there, but I'm just like reading about this page after page after page. There's probably like 100 pages where this is like, he's always trying to be a bigger part of a bigger company. And to me, it's like, that's not your personality. And so I just wrote it to myself. Why does he keep trying to sell his company and then have a position at the larger company? He's not going to be in charge. And I didn't know when I wrote that note to myself, what was going to happen when he gets to time Warner and effectively gets fired. But we're not there yet. So at this point, he's still again, trying to merge Turner broadcasting with another one of the big three networks. And his whole point, and this is just about the news part of it, which I thought was really smart. ([Time 0:54:16](https://share.snipd.com/snip/548b0daf-f5bd-46cf-9edb-66ffb935bd90))
    - **Note:** ABC tries to launch a 24 hour network Ted sued them for anti competitive practices and won. These networks didn’t see the future of tv they were too worried about last night’s ratings. Ted downfall is he wants to grow but gives control. He has a deep understand of the industry maybe better than anyone but Ted’s deals got too complicated and leads him to over leverage himself to a point of hear failure. Genius is simplicity. He wouldn’t died but he taps John Malone who comes in to help and save the company. He had too much leverage and this basically made Malone his boss and losing agency was very tough for Ted. He got tired and sold turner for 8bn after 30 years was ready to hang it up.
