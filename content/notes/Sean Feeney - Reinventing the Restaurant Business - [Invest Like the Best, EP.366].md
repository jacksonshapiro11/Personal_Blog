  Speaker 2
  Can you talk about the power of owning a relationship with a customer who comes back again and again through media and direct connection, which I think for restaurants, historically, People come in, you get a phone number, put it in a book that eat like then who knows, then know your customer hasn't been a powerful part of restaurants historically. I know you have a very different philosophy about this. Talk kind of the soup of that together, the media, the directness of it, the knowing your customer, how to serve them and so on.
  Speaker 1
  It's a relationship to me. And it's a long relationship. Restaurants in general, you think about the experience of dining, the person comes in to check in and they sit down. And for two hours, you have them captive. And then they leave. And I think that is a dining experience. But we've always thought about the experience where it starts with the reservation being made. We are so fortunate that we have people who will spend months and years trying to get a reservation at our restaurants. I do not say that to boast. It is the reality of what we've created. That is an enormous responsibility of ours. It's awesome to understand that people will wait up till midnight every single night until they could possibly get a reservation at your restaurant 30 days later. Once they do have that reservation locked in secured, we got 30 days to begin that journey with you. I don't think about it as it starts when you enter our doors. It starts when you do that reservation. What can we do in 30 days leading up until that point to find out a little bit more about you, why you're coming here, how we're going to make it special. Maybe you find out a little bit more about us. What can we do in creative ways to let you know that we're as excited about you coming to see us as you're excited to see us. I think that's awesome. And then when you do get there, hopefully we have as much information as possible on you. And we will learn more just by being extremely great listeners and asking the right questions and doing our best job at making you happy. And once you do actually leave us and are excited to come back, what do we do with that time? Because that could be another year. It could be a couple months. It could be next week. And so I've always thought about this opportunity we have building a community in these four walls as not just a two hour dining experience. It's a much bigger investment for people than that. It's an investment in time, energy and financial. And that is our awesome responsibility to respect that and to be excited about that and to make people understand that it's not a transaction. This is something that we truly love to do where if we do this the right way, you're going to come here on your first date. You're going to come here when you get engaged. You're going to come here when you get married for your rehearsal dinner. You're going to come here to celebrate great news. But you're also going to come here when you need to be picked up, like a funeral or an election that is really scary for people or bad news. You got fired. There's that part of a relationship we have with people. And it has been amazing to watch people that come in to celebrate and people that need to get picked up. And I think realizing that it makes that awesome responsibility we have to make it bigger than just a two hour dining experience transactional. It's really going through this journey of life. And I think that is what gives us joy. And I think there's just so many cool ways to do it through modes that currently exist. And I think there's modes that can exist, whether that's sending text messages leading up to their dining experience with us, sending surveys after their dining experience with us, All those things exist.

  Speaker 1
  We were extremely acclaimed. But operationally, I did not know if we were the most efficient operation. So I sent out a survey to 500 people, most of them closest friends. And it was a 15 question survey, where it really was structured around the entire dining experience. From the moment you entered our space until you left, when you check in, at what point are you upset about not being sat on time? Is it five minutes after your reservation? 10 minutes after your reservation? 15, 20, 85% of the people said, after 15 minutes, I'm upset. We had the control then to see on our technology of resi, our floor management system, when we would tell people to go back to our cafe to get ready for their dining experience, we could See the timer starts. If it was getting to that 15 minute moment, and we were still not ready to see them, we were going up to talk to them. We did not want people coming up to the host stand asking us what time. Once they sat down, when do you want your first drink? Two minutes after we sit down, our drink order should be in. We want to drink in five minutes. When do you want your order to be put in? 90% of the people said 15 minutes after we sit down, our order is in. Great. So to me, the perfect turn was the hello, the experience and the goodbye. The hello was the first 15 minutes. The experience was then letting our back of house, the artists, the reason why people loved to consume, let them do their thing and not put any pressure on them, so that when the dessert Menu was put on the table at the end, that goodbye started. How many minutes do you want to leave after that dessert menu is put on? 93% of the 500 people said within 20 minutes, we want to be out of there. Great. So in 20 minutes, how do we put that dessert menu on the table, get the dessert on the table, put the check on the table, have it signed so that they're out. And anytime I would ever see in the restaurant, somebody doing the check signal, that's imperfect. So I just started obsessing about this idea of if we could nail this perfect turn, the perfect turn was not getting people in and out as quickly as possible. So we could do as many covers. It was getting people the perfect experience that they wanted at the same time being operationally efficient as a restaurant business. And that would maximize the amount of covers we could do. And it turned out we were able to track all that on these systems we had. We could see the average cover times for two tops, four tops, six tops, eight tops, then we could look at all of our team members that were on those tables in sections and see who was the Best server on two tops on average, who was the best at four tops and six tops and then be able to coach in family meal and line up. How do you move four tops? How do you get your order in in 15 minutes? Tell us it was almost like giving the framework to our team and saying, if you believe in this framework, get us there. I'm not telling you how to get the drinks on the table in five minutes. You are you are person, but this is the framework. If you're believing it, then let's go. That has been a big thing for us to just be able to give a framework. It taught us on how to lead people, get people inspired and see who's going to follow us.
  Speaker 2
  I think the idea of the perfect turn is one of the great questions for anyone listening to ask themselves. Like everyone's producing something. What is the perfect turn equivalent for your thing? It's like such a fun, cool thing to explore. I think about it. I think about it in life.
  Speaker 1
  The reason why we call the perfect turn is a turn is of the restaurant. You have 60 seats in a restaurant. Your first turn is 60. Your second turn is 120 in the night. I was thinking about this perfect turn. Nothing in life is perfect. But to me, perfect turn is that counterpoint of guest satisfaction and restaurant operation. How do you marry that? The same way we've tried desperately to marry the balance of art and commerce. And it's been a huge trust thing between Missy and I or Billy Durney and I as partners or Will Uncelled and I as partners. They are the artists. I needed them to believe me that if we can be this business, this healthy business, you will have the biggest canvas, the most blank biggest canvas to paint on. You could ever imagine and we'll never have the discussion of putting on a cheeseburger or a grilled chicken onto this Italian menu. Like a lot of other people have to do because they have to be safe. And it has always been how do we find that perfect balance between art and commerce? How do we find the perfect balance between guest satisfaction and restaurant operations? How do we find the perfect balance between the accountability of team members but also having a place that they're coming to every day, proud, knowing that it might not be the thing that They do forever. But while they're with us, can they get inspired like we did to do something that they want to do forever? That could be to be in this industry forever, which we're fortunate to have. But it could also be while they're with us to get inspired in a way and if you'll in a good place that they can say, I'm going to go be a jewelry maker because that's what I really want to do. I'm going to go be an artist because that's what I really want to do. I'm going to go to law school. It's always just trying to find the balance of what we're really trying to do at the end of the day.
  Speaker 2
  I love the idea of integrating. Once you find this genius, you sort of embrace it. You describe to me this feeling of doing the thing you're supposed to be doing. Living in that. I imagine I'm very lucky to sort of be in a similar situation where once you have that feeling, you want as much of it as you can possibly get.
