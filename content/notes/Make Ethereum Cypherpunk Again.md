- Author: Vitalik Buterin
- Full Title: Make Ethereum Cypherpunk Again
- Category: #articles

- Summary: The author discusses the original vision of crypto and its potential to build a more free and open society and economy. Ethereum, together with sister technologies like peer-to-peer messaging and decentralized file storage, can be seen as a public decentralized shared hard drive. The author argues that the crypto world needs to resist pressures to become centralized and instead, focus on values such as open global participation, decentralization, censorship resistance, credible neutrality, and a cooperative mindset. The article also discusses the potential of Ethereum and other technologies to create a cypherpunk future that is permissionless, decentralized, censorship resistant, and open source.

### Highlights

- • **Open global participation**: anyone in the world should be able to participate as a user, observer or developer, on a maximally equal footing. Participation should be **permissionless**.
  • **Decentralization**: minimize the dependence of an application on any one single actor. In particular, **an application should continue working even if its core developers disappear forever**.
  • **Censorship resistance**: centralized actors should not have the power to interfere with any given user's or application's ability to operate. Concerns around bad actors should be addressed at higher layers of the stack.
  • **Auditability**: anyone should be able to validate an application's logic and its ongoing operation (eg. by running a full node) to make sure that it is operating according to the rules that its developers claim it is.
  • **Credible neutrality**: base-layer infrastructure [should be neutral](https://nakamoto.com/credible-neutrality/), and in such a way that anyone can see that it is neutral even if they do not already trust the developers.
  • **Building tools, not empires**. Empires try to capture and trap the user inside a walled garden; tools do their task but otherwise interoperate with a wider open ecosystem.
  • **Cooperative mindset**: even while competing, projects within the ecosystem cooperate on shared software libraries, research, security, community building and other areas that are commonly valuable to them. Projects **try to be positive-sum, both with each other and with the wider world**. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkk1bd9fp5tejqtvjwrtpjbk))
