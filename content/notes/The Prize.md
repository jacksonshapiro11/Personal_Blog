### Highlights

- In 1990 futurist were saying that there was peace on the horizon and wars would no longer be fought for oil. Kumbaya sort of stuff then and August of 1990 iraq invades Kuwait. The west stepped in to defend Kuwait to stop Iraq from getting oil. Hw bush realized he must stop him because he’s a dangerous dictator needed to step in and stop him. There was an oil shock but this was quickly remedied. The war couldn’t be avoided needed to be proactive with Sadam. Saddam doubted the west’s resolve the us needed a quick resolution. The us doubled forces and went on the offensive. Thought the us was soft. The us debated going to war by 53 -47 vote with much of the Vietnam pain still they they got it. Iraq tried to draw Israel in to get Arab support but us kept them out. Invasion was a route. Us dominated the war. Used deception and oil. Oil is central to the development of the western world and has shown all sides of human nature.
- The Saudis were losing market share and thus geopolitical power so they worked out a deal to gain power back by striking a deal where refiners got a $2 profit of every barrel and the Saudis made the rest. This helped them keep market share and got rid of the opec price that had dominated. The Saudis wanted to remain market share but had to compromise on price. This led to prices declining 70%. Created race to the bottom. Oil and opec along with the rest of the world agreed on a middle price. Oil that had fallen to $5 was now agreed by producers and consumers that it should cost more like $15-18 this would be a fair price hemp maintain the order and allow for investment in alternatives at good prices. All had learned their lesson about extractive oil prices both ways. They all agreed on quotas and formalize price again. This restored price stability. The end of the Iran Iraq war marked would appear to be stabilization in the region where both consumers and producers wanted stability and the idea of sovereignty has been figured out so the market could open up and redefine itself and mature. Seems like lessons had been learned and peace was on the horizon but with human nature and desire for power how sustainable could this sustainability be.
- The 1980s led to a period of austerity where there was a double stock market bottom in 1980 and 1982 and economic activity stalled due to fed raising rates. OPEC was no longer the main exporter. More expensive oil justified new production that became economical. OPEC had to collude to reduce supply as a result. Oil started to become just another commodity. Oil market was now very spot focused. The invention of oil futures led to price discovery happening daily and on the floor of the stock exchange previously an industry dominated by 10 year plans was now changing daily. T Boone Pickens was a man who bought stock in oil companies selling below the value of reserves and sold them. Front ran consolidation of industry with value of reserves. Value investing. Oil companies themselves stopped exploring and instead bought proven reserves. Oil lending took down a large bank so lending to these companies was off the table risk wise. Pickens orchestrated a take over for gulf which eventually led to them being bought by Chevron. Showed how the mighty had fallen. Gulf tried to go for too many elephants and lost track of the day to day needs. This led to more cash being returned to shareholders to avoid takeovers. Oil became just another commodity.
- The oil issues led to the weaking of the position of the west. The fall of the west was made even more clear by the invasion of the us embassy in Iran. The Americans were taken hostages Iranian hostage crisis. People were held hostage for 15 months and people chanted death to America which helped the ayatollah consolidate power. Jimmy Carter formalized the Carter doctrine that the us would respond with force to any unrest in the region formalizing an informal dictum. The Saudis tried to keep prices low. They had the most reserves and thought long term didn’t want to exploit people. Us after crisis froze Iranian assets. Shah died year later as an afterthought. Saudis saw keeping the market steady as important while other opec producers thought the good times would last forever. Different timelines. Yamini thought everyone would pay for their greed. Believed in supply and demand. Iraq invaded Iran in 1980s due to baath party headed by Sadam Hussein being at odds with the Ayatollah no lost love there. Hussein wanted to take the mantle as spiritual leader of Iraq. Iraq thought it would be a quick war but tje ayotollah used it to concentrate power and also used the people as martyrs. Used kids to clear minefields so tanks didn’t get blown up. Threw everyone on the front line saying if they died they’d go to heaven and it worked. Also managed to cut off oil exports from Iraq. At the end of the 70s the oil price stayed stagnant for a decade.
- Anatomy of a crisis. The small oil declines led to panic buying companies envoking force majure spot markets became very popular. Compete change in market structure that compounded 5% change 150% price increase. New paradigm in oil. Peoples hoarded terrible feedback loop. Really into the psychology of humans. Led to nationwide panic. Oil companies were derided. Overall very difficult situation. Carter was gone after 2 years reputation in shambles. 3 mile island disaster only compounded the entire thing. Overall anatomy of a bear. Good market insights. Very long gas lines and rationing didn’t help consumer sentiment a 3 mile island killed the nuclear discussion. When you feel a market that bad it really effects your psychologically. Politics couldn’t withstand a bad energy month. 45 minute gas lines led to frustration and Carter approval rating was 25%. Carter asked his entire cabinet to show change but the people only saw weakness. Traders flooded in led to more speculation. The world market was in panick and out of control.
- In 1979 Carter visited the shah this was peak shah. The shah was starting to modernize the country. But debt became 70% of salary people started turning towards religion and against the shah. The us government didn’t gather intel on Iran partly out of cognitive dissonance. He had can we wasn’t running straight and was losing his grip. The us didn’t look into Iran because they couldn’t imagine it falling but unrest and democratization led to more unrest which led to riots then killings then more unrest. Bad cycle. The us had no plan they never doubted the shah took years for then to realize there was a problem the opposition supported the ayatollah as liberal and modern obviously wrong but the country had had enough of the shah and the us never doubted him or had the policy or intel to remedy the situation. Iranian money was useless and this crisis led to the second oil shock. 5% decrease in international supply triggered 150% price increase proper panic.
- Carter came in and tried to stabilize the oil market. Oil companies stopped investing in the developing world and looks in the US because it was more stable. Oil companies worried about the future prospects also started to diversify into other businesses. One even bought a circus. Oil exploration continued, and the combination of Alaska and Canada and Mexico filled the gap. Mexico, pet under invested in oil exploration, but due to bad economic times they needed oil and actually became a massive player once again. Shows virtue of capitalism and happy people don’t cause problems. Oil was done found in the North Sea. Many empty holes were drilled but eventually it was found right before they were about to give up. The North Sea put Brittans oil on the map and the PM in a country that hates opec now said he wanted to run the org. Rebels use tactics they previously fought against Due to oil instability forecasting became popular used by companies. The forecasts were more around cope and incentives rather than actual predictions. Good insight on predictions.
- Economic growth is central to democratic institutions. The western countries look to alternatives to use the oil issue with substitute, but maintain growth prospects. Japan was the leader in transitioning the economies from energy intensive production to knowledge work which used much less oil. Lead to nuclear power and more coal use. France adopted a line that you couldn’t promote energy use. Had to promote energy reduction. Couldn’t encourage consumption. Was made legit illegal. The oil man were operated in front of Congress and questioned why their profits were going up during this oil crisis. Was a political dismantling. They called it obscene profits. Oil companies were the most hated in the entire country and the worldwide. There was the idea that they started the crisis to make money. Profits were huge, but actually lagged industrial growth in the US. Domestic energy policy was very divisive. Public wanted oil prices to be restored to old levels but supply to remain constant and this couldn’t happen. Us championed programs for alternative fuels. The Alaskan pipeline was allowed to go on. It had been held up for environmental problems and cars were required to be more fuel efficient
- Yamini got control of oil policy in Saudi. He was a western educated intelligent man who was tough to negotiate with. at this time, the Saudi and the Iranians were having issues with supremacy and power. it was sewing division in the two countries and the Saudis thought the shah was crazy. Yamini thought only long term and hated gambling and took calculated risks. The west due to democracy was shorter term. He was very calm. The US wanted oil stability even tried to make a deal with the Soviets for oil. That fell through. They wanted more control over the Shah who is exercising his power. The shah was key to the United States. With Nixon leaving yet to deal with Carter who is much more pro human rights, which was an issue for him. Shah was realizing that more money didn’t make his people happier and actually lead to more problems for him. The shah decided to lower prices. Kuwait over through gulf and nationalized oil. American stock that these people love them because they brought wealth to them, but they actually felt patronized. All the great concessions were being nationalized. Venezuela and Saudi nationalized. The companies made the deals that they could, but they were in a weak position to negotiate. The American companies were still needed to market the oil so relationships were kept in that regard. Oil companies were contractors. Sovereignty of countries was recognized, put colonial issues to bed.
- The oil weapon sewed division between Western Allies with the French breaking against the US and only the Netherlands supported the US. This completely realigned ties and power dynamics, and eventually Sadat was the one who said that they must come back to the table and agree on peace because the oil weapon had been used sufficiently. This was a complete change in power dynamics with many European countries turning towards the Arab countries and away from the us. Sadat took back the power for eygpt. OPEC could turn the international order upside down. OPEC basically controlled world geopolitics with the oil weapon in its hand. GDP from 1973-75 fell 6% while unemployment doubled to 9%. The entire world was in a recession. Inflation was a serious problem. Japan saw it first GDP declined since the end of the war and the Japanese people stopped revolting against capitalism and instead down virtue in hard work. Developing nations hit the hardest. The global south was hurt the most and wanted to find a solution that wasn’t high-minded but practical to growth and stability. OPEC was king.
- The us post war had oil crisis because demand became so high. Us became a net importer. The oil crisis changed the psyche of the west going from a view of abundance to that of scarcity. Nation public confidence fell from 62% to 27% in a year. Mind of Americans was hurt significantly. The view from the Americans was the past things over with the Middle East and the view from the Europeans was oil was unstable and they needed to use less. Interesting mindset difference. The embargo was only on certain countries so the oil companies a fair pain principal were supply was equally distributed and the non-embargo countries we get Arab Boyle and the embargo countries would get non-Arab oil. This balance actually worked well and the companies faced political and business pressures but they ended up striking a pretty good balance and fair distribution. The posted price of oil went up 4x due to this crisis. The shah exploited and alienated people in this process and this created issues leading him to lose allies he would need down the road. He became the moralist of oil. Sadat and Kissinger came together and Sadat was ready to make peace from stronger position.
- Between 1948-1972 consumption of oil went up 5x in the work and 3x in the us. In Europe it went up 15x. In Japan it was ~150x. Driven by internal heating cars factories ran with oil. Plastics were everywhere we became an oil society. Oil was cheap coal was expensive and the unions made coal even more annoying which lead to the move to oil as the supply was more stable. In 1955 75% of Europe used coal and oil 23% by in 1972 it was 22% coal and 60% oil. It was just cheaper everyone used it. Economic growth powered economic growth. It was everywhere. Everyone wanted to control the oil supply in their country. Gas companies all marketed their product. It was a commodity product and everyone rushed to provide the best marketing for their brand giving free maps away along with washes. Anything to get customers said their gas was special had special properties ect. Oil lead to the need for hotels and drive in restaurants. Automobile became central to American life 90% of vacations were taken by car. Turnpikes were built in 2 years.
- Oil was run on the concession system where oil companies would own the land explore for and oil this was changing. You could own the right to explore for oil in a territory. Could be a very big territory. This was now seen as colonialism the oil countries wanted sovereignty and nationalization. The companies allowed the countries to own oil through participation in the company or outright nationalization. Led to ownership by the countries big move. The balance of power had shifted. Asserting control over the resources was vital and could be used to leverage power but those in Washington ignored this warning. Oil was running at 99% capacity no slack capacity. The west hadn’t fully grasped the game had changed forever.
- Post the October war oil soared 600%. Oil producers realized how much leverage they had and decided to restrict supply as a strategy.
- OPAC was created, but initially the West was not afraid of it and it took long time for it to become relevant. Western Powers ignored it at the beginning issues caused further headwind. France discovered oil in Algeria in an effort to secure oil independence. Lybia which ks a desolate country discovers oil there is a boom there. Linus was so corrupt when a prominent person died the people in charge were confused who to bribe. Oil exploration returns fell as more independents flooded the market. Excess returns got competed away. Independents started more exploration and took power from the majors. Iran and Saudi hated each other and the oil companies needed to keep both happy in order to keep overall relations in a good place. Us put tax on imports which lead to independents gaining more power.
- Iran had a leadership issue with the shah and also were struggling as a country and scapegoated a lot of their issues on the British who were to blame but they became the central enemy. Eventually the Iranian people started killing anyone who was perceived as pro British and nationalized Anglo Iranian. Mohamed mosadek raised rich but hated the British and wanted revolution. Overthrow the shah. Would change his mind and take whatever position served him politically. The British wanted to maintain their empire and the Americans wanted to stop communism. The British empire was on its last legs and fighting for Anglo Iranian was key to them. Mosadek struggled he had to balance foreign pressure and nationalistic interests. Anyone bro Brittish was killed. Eventually the weakness and inability to invade when the Brit’s would’ve done so on the past led to the nationalization of oil and end of the empire. Brittish were expelled and economic embargo placed on Iranian oil. Brought production for 660k to 20k a day. The cia and mi6 use operation Ajax to overthrow mosadek and put the shah back in. This was kinda inevitable given national unrest and it could’ve gone right or left so the west made sure it went their way. Us wanted oil companies to go back into Iran times were bad in Iran and they didn’t want economic unrest to lead to Soviet control. Us state department wanted oil companies to come together at the same time other areas of the government were calling them monopolies. Different areas of the government with consistently different policy. The government would support anti competitive tactics for geopolitical reasons then the government 20 years later would wage a suit on this basis very circular. Eventually einsenhower gives them immunity to do this. This was the first agreement that agreed the country ie Iran owned the oil but the oil companies worked to market and extract it first collaboration. After this the us was the major player in the Middle East but with this deal and the reliance on oil would lead to more problems. This basically the Middle East fights back.
- The new availability of oil led to extreme economic booms, but was almost too successful. Demand was soon gonna outstripping supply and then the order of how to split the profits was becoming more contentious and under the gun. The oil exporting companies wanted more power and money and started to extract rent from oil importing countries. It was very unclear who made the excess profits from oil. The home country needed to strike the right extractive balance with the company investing and digging it out. This was called rent = excess profits. The rent was both seem as money and power so there was financial and status to the rent you got in the negotiations. Venezuelan government bought back against the US and established a 50-50 agreement per oil rent, but the revolutionaries in the country hated this and saw it as colonialism the companies saw it as their best option. The post war oil order started to fall apart due to oil being found in a neutral territory. John Paul Getty was a ruthless man who drove hard bargains was a gambler and always got his way. Getty had 5 wives never loved any of them. Very laser focused on value.
- Enricho mattei was an Italian man who headed the Italian refining company eni. He was a great oil man in a world where oil man had been replaced by big faceless companies. He upset the 50-50 principal making it 75-25. In an effort to secure supply Japan tried to get into the Middle East too. Al nassar had no oil in Egypt but led the Muslim revolutions. Became clear this was a big issue and the governments in the Middle East needed to be careful to not be overthrown there was a violent revolution in Iraq. In Venezuela Perez Alfonso was in government exiled then invited back after the government had been overthrown. He was a deeply principled man and didn’t given into any corruption. He studied the Texas railroad condition and saw how monopolies formed. An American educated Muslim nationalists tariki came to power due to a fracture in power between the brothers who ruled Saudi Arabia and he wanted to nationalize oil but after a demand sure realized supply and price controls were more important. The Soviet’s entered the oil market the oil companies had a posted and final price. The posted price dictated the rents and would never be cut until the market became too flooded and bp cut this lead to an oil congress in eypgt which exported no oil but showed nassars power. At this conference they had a secret James Bond meeting where they made a gentleman’s agreement to establish national oil companies defend price structure develop oil commission. Become more integrated. Wanda jablonski was a key journalist who played match maker on the people at this meeting which laid the groundwork for opec.
- Getty made a deal with the Saudis for oil to wildcat in the dessert. He was a rich eccentric man who loved money. His eulogy said he was associated with money. Was a high compliment to him. Drilled 5 Saudi wells was gonna give up struck so much oil on the 6th he became the worlds first billionaire. Still had a pay phone in his house. Getty to get his oil concession agreed to a higher royalty than anyone else had. This was a big deal for the majors that the independents were conceeding on. The Venezuelans let the Saudis know about the 50-50 concession which led to the Saudis fighting for more money through exploiting us tax law. Then every country wanted 50-50. In order to keep these people have 50-50 became the standard everywhere. As long as the country was richer they’d like western governments more and they were less likely to have oil nationalized. This was a revolution because it transferred power from the traditional conquerors to the conquered people
- Gulf and shell make a deal so shell can have access to oil in the Middle East. This is the beginning of United States companies, getting a foothold in the Middle Eastern oil market. Stalin for his part wanted to secure more oil in the middle East. They needed oil from Iran and Stalin wanted to expand his sphere of influence by gaining control in the Middle East. England had big energy issues that shut down the country. This is what vaulted the us with the Marshall plan to basically take over bail out and run Western Europe. The Marshall plan does not happen without oil. Oil as a result has to be purchased in dollars. This changed the economy from coal to oil. The unions made coal annoying to deal with which fueled oil demand. The Saudis fight against Israel and hated it, but realized internal crises power within the country as well as communism were more important than hating the Jews and thus couldn’t restrict oil flow. Most oil came from the us in 1951 but the European demand completely changed the landscape. He refused to cancel the oil concession despite protests. New oil pipeline led to recovery of Europe. Rise of Soviet’s made Middle East more important. Us was now leader of the free world and oil was central to the new economy so they needed to firm up their influence in the middle east for protection purposes. Saudis and the us formed a strong relationship. Weaving public and private relationships in Saudi was a new paradigm but Saudis and Texas oil men created an unlikely union. Us lost oil independence. Imported petroleum killed need for synthetic fuels was too expensive but led to loss of oil independence. New tech led to increasing use of natural gas pipelines which were previously just burnt off and not used as well as drilling at sea which was doubted and hard to do but when oil was found gained popularity. Natural gas pipeline went up 2.5x and satisfied 700k barrels a day of oil demand.
- Oil was utilized as a weapon during the Yom Kippur war. First major supply shortages ever. People were saying there would be a massive shortage and conservation and innovation was needed but this was not the prominent view and was ignored. Price of crude oil doubled. The Saudi states didn’t like us support for Israel Egypt wanted to be respected again and part of the world order not just a military non growth country. No one took them seriously Kissinger didn’t believe Sadat would start a war in Israel which he did to help his position on the international stage a form of diplomacy. Sadat worked with Saudis to wield the oil weapon. Kissinger didn’t buy it they didn’t want war but needed attention so did it. Wanted to change public opinion. Leaders needed to shower power to their people and wider Arab world. The day before the war started despite many indications both Israel and us saw war as unlikely. Believed too much in their superiority and that lybia and Egypt wouldn’t invade. Israel underestimated felt they couldn’t be aggressive too much hubris and didn’t have enough supplies for a long war. With Soviet weapons new challenge was strong. The soviets were directly sending a lot of materials to Egypt. Israel desperately needed materials us was nervous to support given the ongoing oil negotiations and also couldn’t have Israel losing the war. They needed to help them but in secret. Saudi embargoed oil. Nixon was a weak president this compounded the oil negotiations probably led to war the watergate hampered negotiations it basically all fell on Kissinger. The soviets were moving into the Middle East and Nixon wasn’t even involved in negotiations anymore. A hot Soviet and us war almost started but was diplomatically averted at the 11th hour. Peace had been reached but the geopolitical situation would never been the same. Oil had become a game of politics no longer oil men.
- Everyone was so reliant on oil. After 6 day war. 50% of Middle East supply was shut off creating a panic. Despite the embargo the us and Iran partnered to subvert it and the independents in the us proved massive. Nassar was forced to give up. Cheap oil was seen as a birthright and the good times ran. People claiming that supply came from an unstable region and the good times would not last but these prophecies were seen as killjoys.
- Suez Canal previously owned by the Brit’s but then nationalized by the Egypt this was a critical trade route. The Americans didn’t want to support colonialism with a war. The British and French needed a war to assert dominance. Could not accept a diplomatic defeat. They needed to take strong action. They wanted to use force with nassar not the appeasement policies of ww1 and ww2. The British French and Israelis agreed to a war to allow the 2 large powers to take the canal started by Israel. The Americans didn’t support the British Invasion so they needed to pull out. The suez crisis was proof the British empire was finished.
- The Brit’s left the Middle East previously had an army there left to be less colonial even though the rulers in the Middle East wanted them to stay this created a power vacuum Iran filled. At this time the us lost its surplus that the world always relied on. Oil was in a 20 year supply glut that was ending. Also environmental impact studies lead to oil adoption over coal and drilling restriction. Robert Anderson was one of the last great wildcatters of the 20th century led the charge in Alaska when everyone else doubted it. They struck an elephant in Alaska. Revolutionized the oil scene. Was their last planned well previous 8 were dry. Wanted to build a pipeline but was blocked by environmental lobby first time ever. They blocked this said the oil wasn’t needed landed needed protection. Armon hammer bought occidental petroleum a failing company in his 60s turned it into a world leader. He worked with Lenin in a previous business now worked with Gorbachev. The gadafi who had been plotting a coup since middle school took over lybia he was one of many coups planned at the kings death. Balance of power had radically shifted. Now oil countries had the power. OPEC was gaining their strength
- The Americans produced 90% of ww2 oil but it was clear stockpiles were dwindling and the age of American dominance was over. They turned their sights to the Middle East as the supply of oil going forward. Knew there was oil but geopolitics and bad terrain made developing tough when it wasn’t needed but now it was. The us tries to control oil directly through ownership of the oil companies but the companies not involved in this deal fought back and it never happened what was clear was the us knew they needed and were running out of oil so ones that had to do something. The Americans and British work with Saudis after the war to develop an oil cartel. When fdr died and ickies got fired by Truman support for the agreement fell away as people thought the us had enough oil but this turned out to be false the us was soon to become a net importer.
- The us found a way to ramp production through innovation and enhanced production from existing wells by 35% between 1941 and 1945. The us supplied 6 of the 7 billion allowed barrels during the war. The demand side had to be rationed but the American people saw gas as a birthright. The us then used the presidents of Harvard and mit Bernard Baruch to start a campaign to save rubber. This was a proxy to save gas. This was very controversial but did work. The country forced rationed and was able to reduce use by 30% using the war as its justification. WW2 was a war of motion gas was used 100x more in ww2. The planning didn’t consider this. The us never had an oil shortage which was a testament to the innovation and great system. They also innovated in high octane 100 fuel which was invented pre war and ramped from 40k to 500k barrels a day as it provided a massive impact to planes. Us innovated much in this invention. Patton wanted to punch through German lines but didn’t have gas. There was a chance that if well supplied he could’ve ended the war but this was not to be. Patton wasn’t given the oil and the Germans had time to regroup this extended the war 9 months led to many more deaths and allowed the Russians to take Berlin and gain more post territory. The decision to compromise and give fuel to the British and not Patton may have killed millions in the name of politics and compromise. Damn shame for Eisenhower. But this plan was very high risk could’ve been a suicide decision. Strategists do believe that this was the way to end the war easily and cutting off this supply extended and ruined the best chance of a quick ending. The success was in doubt but this compromise to keep everyone happy was likely a big mistake don’t compromise.
- Henri deaterding became a nazi later in life this caused heartache for Brittish control of shell in ww2. He died the Brittish basically nationalized it. The Brittish were worried about how they’d get oil and tried to strike a deal with Romania to destroy their oil so the Germans couldn’t use it but this deal wasn’t struck. The Americans through lend lease helped supply this Brittish with oil and the British for their part worked to limit and ban discretionary gas use like driving and concentrate oil in defensible places that could be destroyed is England was taken. Harold ickies became the oil czar. It was a tough situation because the us and fdr had broken up oil now that needed to unite it and produce unlimited amounts. Initially difficult but eventually this was coordinated and ran smoothly. The battle of the Atlantic lasted many months and tipped the balance of the war. The u boats owned the water and aimed for oil tankers sinking 25% in one year. This led to dangerous shortages. Pipelines were invented to transport oil on land. The big blow was dealt through radar and code breaking which nullified the uboats and the Germans had to withdraw them because they kept getting sunk. This opened the Atlantic stabilized oil allowed the allies to mount a land invasion of Europe all which required this key victory in the Atlantic to enable shipping.
- Japan gained total control of the East Indies pretty soon after Pearl Harbor. The oil men destroyed some refineries. These men were often left stranded in the jungle 75 men were left only 35 survived. Japan had secured this key resource area they needed. Japan quickly ramped oil production in almost 2 years back to pre destruction levels. The us for their part won a big victory at midway and this was the turning point they rebuilt quickly then used their might to go on the offensive. Japan still struggled to get oil because they needed to get it from Indonesia to Japan. The Americans broke the Japanese code and the American subs destroyed Japan’s hopes of transporting oil. The Japanese vastly underestimated the Americans skill and resolve to their detriment. These reasons were why Japan struggled and lost the war. The Americans destroyed 90% of Japanese ships and Americans destroyed oil tankers so much so they never even got back after their first voyage and they had almost none left. The us blockade and failure of synthetic fuels lead to japans failure. Japans lack of oil changed their tactics made them more predictable and even led to the kamakazes because it required much less fuel and pilot training burned too much fuel as is.
- Hitler made oil key to their building of the nation. Secured oil supplies as the beginning of his plan for world dominance. He realized he needed to secure oil supply domestically to make war. He didn’t want to be dependent on anyone. The Germans developed synthetic fuel and waged war on Russia focused on capturing Baku to own the oil. They miscalculated the invasion and didn’t have enough resources which left them stretched and vulnerable. The Germans in all theaters stretched supply lines and didn’t secure oil and this made them very vulnerable. They tried with every offensive to get oil but couldn’t. Use mental oasis to think through problems and key principles. North Africa was lost because Rommel couldn’t get enough oil in supply lines. Destroying the synthetic oil was key to the allied victory only did it late in 1943. The loss of oil supplies effectively ended the war for Germany.
- Japan was actually a country functioning very well and Democratic before World War II but the extremist factions protested by basically shooting everyone they didn’t like who wanted cooperation. Japan wanted to prepare for war and realize they needed oil access. The US remain friendly with Japan, but as a war with China ripped up, it became harder to continue to export and support the regime. Japan needed the US for oil. FDR wanted to keep the peace with Japan but the American people was very anti Japan. Fdr thought sanctions would lead to war and was more focused on nazis. Oil became a key issue in Japan. Look for a preemptive strike so it could get the oil in the indies. The strike was out of desperation. The US froze Japanese bank accounts so it cannot buy oil this was viewed as the last straw from Japan. The us realized Japan could no longer be trusted. Japan knew they needed oil and they needed to keep the war short it was very risky but their only option. The US was shocked about the attack and Japan, then went to conquer every other country in the Pacific. The mistake/issue the Japanese made was stopping. The Japanese forgot to destroy the oil in Hawaii which didn’t immobilize the Americans completely had they done this the us would’ve really been set back.
- A man named Holmes goes to Saudi Arabia looking for oil and everyone doubt he could find it there. No one would even buy him out for pennies on the dollar but eventually he finds a partner in gulf. People laughed at him, but eventually he was right. the British tried to keep the US out of the Middle Eastern oil business so they can have control. Iban saud united Saudi Arabia but it was tough to keep everyone happy and he needed money to keep people happy and this is where oil came in. The Americans beat out the British for oil interests in the region. The British lost Saudi Arabia to the US, but Kuwait fell on hard times and the British established dominance there. Andrew Mellon was an owner of gulf and negotiated their foothold in Kuwait giving both brittan and the us a presence. As more oil is discovered in Saudi Arabia, the Power plays to grasp it become more ornate and involved.
- The oil producers try to unite across the world to control supply and maintain profits. At this time, they have to deal with so many political issues from rising nationalism in Europe to the shop of Iran, fighting back against them. The shah cancelled the agreement with Anglo Persian for oil production. The 1930s was an era of tried and failed coordination among the many powers that be in Europe. Eventually, the Persians came to an agreement with better royalties. There was also unrest in Mexico that had to be sorted out. The Mexicans elect a nationalist president who wants to take control of oil and hates capitalism, and this creates tension between the oil companies who are used to treating Mexico as a colony in Mexico, which is fighting for its independence and against capitalism with a new president. Mexico nationalize the oil fields right before World War II. The Brits needed Mexico as South America was there only reliable place of oil that could be controlled so they had to be firm, but the US was much more concerned with hemispheric defense so gave into Mexico rather than have them sell the oil to the Nazis and have Nazis on their shore. The US had oil demand met through internal production, but the UK did not have this and so this was an existential issue for them, but the Mexicans calculated right as the Americans have their back and the oil companies desires for national defense. The US government screwed their own oil companies by selling with Mexico for very cheap in the ticket or leave it arrangement. The British government waited until after the war and the British companies in Mexico, much better deal, but the Mexican production, which was nationalized struggled after the war, and the workers did not get paid more. They actually got paid less and they produce less because they had less tech advancement and, taking of oil by a country shocked the oil companies first time since Russia and foreshadowed a lot of what was to come.
- Oil is found in East Texas classic boom bust of the region. This was the biggest reservoir ever discovered. The guy who discovered it had to sell out for Pennies on the dollar he found it but bad finances and he died poor. Us production was booming and driving prices down leading people to panic. They tried to constrain Supply but couldn’t. People wanted action to bring oil prices under control. They limited production to keep prices down and companies afloat. They regulated production instead of price fixing. Regulation in the sector was incredibly slow, incremental piece by piece requiring a combination of new deal, economics and heavy capitalist oilman to unite in a strange alliance to create regulation. this is a very strange combination of people. Need a shock to the system to coordinate these parties who didn’t get along, but both needed to come to the table.
- Pearson led a lot of the exploration in Mexico and he preached independent thinking an autocratic control. He was a world famous engineer, who is invited to Mexico to help improve their position by the dictator of Mexico. Mexican revolution led to changing environment and fight between companies and autocratic regimes about who really own the oil and then how to get the capital to invest and develop it. This would be a common future trend. Venezuela took over Mexicos production after Mexican investment went down post revolution. The person in charge of Venezuela was a dictator. The dictator wanted to make his poor country rich, but realized he needed geopolitical stability to get investment. People thought there was no oil in Venezuela, and then eventually they hit oil and it became the second largest producer outside of the US. The mix of geopolitics and oil was also present after the Russian revolution. The Nobel‘s want to sell their oil in Russia to standard of New Jersey standard buys us up Borgen price, assuming the bolshiveks would lose. Lenin nationalized oil, but then realized he needed to bring in Western countries because they had the superior technology and the country needed money. The decision whether to buy from Russia became very controversial and much debated.
- In the 1920s car travel became massive in the US and the invention of the gas station happen. Gasoline became a religion in the US. It gave everyone freedom and autonomy. Oil was at the center of a big government corruption where people took kickbacks for favorable treatment. Was the first major scandal of this kind. Technological improvements like aerial reconnaissance and sizemagraphs allowed oil to be discovered easier.
- During World War I, the lack of oil possibility of shortage became very tangible, and oil itself became vaulted as a key commodity, and after the war, every country country focused on the Middle East to secure a stable supply of oil. Oil became central to the US economy and Wallet was the largest producer. It could already see shortfalls and needed to get in the Middle East, but France and England were preventing it. The British then realized fighting the US was not beneficial, technologically or geopolitically so they caved. The US underwent a shift from a war on business to the government brace of business after World War I. Everything is cyclical. Teagle can into run standard and he was the first professional manager not an owner. After the war, Britain realized ruling iraq in the Middle East would be too expensive, so they implemented a constitutional monarchy who supported them. Iraq was a mess a combination of Arabs, Jews, Sony, and she may getting along very hard. The new king had a lot to do. So much oil was found in Iraq that everyone bought to divvy up the land and close every day possible
- Machines became vital in war. A French general mobilized taxis to re-affirm the front line it couldn’t use rail or any other system. The gas powered taxis kept France in the war, which may have tilted the balance in the allies favor. Then machines were used on battlefields this defined the war. The tank was developed during the war and noted as of the big reasons why Germany surrendered they could not combat the tanks that ripped through the lines. One year into war, all the planes have become obsolete. Planes define the war through bombing missions. The war constantly push innovation with airplanes speed doubling during the war. During the war while the agreement has just been made oil from Persia was vital to winning and the company saw the war time to expand. They were finally on good financial footing with strong demand and they bought a formally owned German distributor that had been seized during the war called BP. Shell was critical to the war effort too and oil basically defined this war. During the war discretionary use of oil for civilian driving was banned, and government and industry came together to form many oil coalitions. Key geopolitical issue. There was a coal shortage during winter, and this led oil to become even more important and government controls to be implemented. The Germans desperately tried to get oil, but could not really hurt there war effort.
- The Germans posed a big problem to England, militarily and England England wanted Navel supremacy. The only way they do this was still converting shifts from coal to oil. The Man put in charge of the Navy was Churchill before World War I. He realized oil was needed because it had such a big advantage, but they didn’t have sufficient quantities so they use develop both the ships and the infrastructure to get oil. Churchill gets a bill passed that brings oil control under British rule by buying Anglo Persian oil company. Then there was a contract that the British could buy oil at a discount price from the company for 20 years. Public ownership of a company was very rare and controversial, but the value is clear and it passed almost unanimously. Not six months later when everything seemed peaceful World War I broke out with the machines powered by oil vital the conflict and success
- Henri Deterding took control of royal Dutch, and he was a man who was very simplistic had a deep understanding for balance sheets, and was emergent simplified things to their core when he analyzed them. Him and Marcus Samuel of Shell decided they needed to merge. Samuel is negotiating with deterding and standard but eventually they work out a deal but then deterding then has leverage and uses it against Samuel to gain day to day operational control. He is a great operator and Samuel becomes mayor of London losses focus and henri takes full control of the management of the company
- The Texas oil boom catalyzed oil over coal. The melons ended up financing and then something into run the new operation in Texas. Mellon comes into a failing operation and brings organizational expertise to it creating a great new company. They needed to improve operation and vertically integrated. This became gulf. The people they took over from made much but went broke in the end. Texaco was financial stable because they stored oil when it was cheap and sold it when it was expensive. Standard is losing their power and then in this loss they start getting broken up John D resigns and the progressives start their muckraking war to break up trust’s. All they did was expose the world to the excesses and the people changed. Light as a disinfectant. Oil was seen as pure gambling to oil men like playing cards.
- Oil is discovered in the Middle East and Persia and the shah pit, the Russians against the British for ownership in the region. This was a geopolitical fight between the two powers. England won but the build out of oil infrastructure took 200k when 10k was assumed and the geopolitical situation in the country was tricky. The entire thing was very tenuous. Less than three years into the Persian exploration. It was on the verge of collapse. The British government did not want to sell out to another country or person. Darcy was running the company and the Brittish government funded a saving the company by patriots who did it more to secure the Brittish empire than anything. This was the start of mixing profit and politics in the Middle East. George Reynolds was in charge and discovered oil in south Persia which was incredibly remote and very difficult to endure.
- The big oil players try to syndicate, but can’t and so they fight to get into Asia more directly and this lead to them all courting Royal Dutch shell. The Dutch refused to sell and also create an ownership structure with preferential shares sh standard couldn’t acquire them and take control. Electricity was introduced, and it took the entire kerosene market away because it was only being used for light. As light went away the idea of a horseless carriage came along. Cars went from something that people said get a horse because they went so slow to a status symbol and part of the economy a necessity. Gas, had been a useless byproduct was now the star of the show you could not even give it away now at powered cars. Standard tried to dominate the area, but the independent producers banded together built a pipeline and competed with standard. then oil which should only been a Pennsylvania phenomenon was found in other places in the US. Oil was found in California, but that mainly served the Asian market. Oil found in Texas and there’s resistance to both of these places producing oil, but eventually they do. This guy has visions of oil and believes, but no one believes in him standard doesn’t fund him, and he finds some wildcatters who helped him develop in Texas and are willing to bet the guy he found people believed he had a sixth sense for finding oil. People believe they may find oil that does 50 gallons a day but they find one that does 75,000. The idea of gushers invented and people flood into Beaumont. And that went for $10 was now worth 900,000. This creates the classic boom bust. We’re so much oil is produced that eventually it’s sold for nothing.

    - **Note:** The beginning of the oil market was a few players and was nearly killed by electricity. Standard tried to dominate the world by taking over Shell, but they changed their ownership structure to block them. At this point in the industry the people who ran the companies were conquerors and the people on the frontier were crazy risk taking wildcatters the boom and bust nature was ingrained in the industry. Stay in the game long enough to get lucky think crazy and live on the frontier. The car was considered a joke and gas was a useless byproduct to oil both these changed drastically with electricity and the car. People thought oil was only in penn but it was everywhere. People believed and took risk on the frontier and were successful. Incredible boom bust dont die. Everything was interrelated the companies wanted to expand through access to asia and the car fitting in with the gas was innovation with withered tech. Gas was right time and place commodity
- Soon after its discovery it was shipped worldwide and became the US number four export quickly. Everyone thought the US would be the center of oil, but the oil was found in Russia and the Nobel brothers went in 10 years to make it the largest oil producing area and also invented oil tankers. They produce oil in Baku eventually competition flowed into the market and prices went down and people went out of business. Then the Rothchild bought an unfinished railroad and united Russia, so oil could be shipped anywhere. Before this, it was cheaper to get oil in tablisi from Pennsylvania vs Baku. Rockefeller had dominant position, but then the Rothschilds and nobels created competition, and it was the end of world dominance Rockfeller. Marcus and Samuel Samuel were British Jews, who helped oil go worldwide with the use of telegraph, which was just put in place so you can connect with anyone anywhere. Samuel built a new tanker that was more efficient and safer, and brought through the Suez Canal with much resistance from the Rockefellers and other anti-Semitic, but once they did this, the Rockefellers had lost and oil had become global. Samuel could now sell to the far east. Samuel knew he needed to be in every market so standard cannot kill him in one market and because he went global standard, could not run the playbook of lowering prices to drive our competition. The Samuel’s controlled the Suez Canal they had no organization but this worked. It was just the 2 brothers. The nobels Rothschild and standard try to organize a coalition for world domination but never could.
- The joint stock company was a new invention of the time and the trust was formed with shared ownership. The people running the company would always meet together and discuss ideas. Rockefeller had a conviction in oil so he could always buy the dip, but he was always fin financially secure, and he assembled the smartest people in the space and they always debated. He always listened quietly and then would summarize everything said at the end very well. Remain very frugal his entire life and the company controlled cost down to the cent. John D at dinner with every item on the bill and make sure he wasn’t being over charged. Did not let his kids grow up spoiled instill values into them At this point, they were only selling kerosene and gas was just a byproduct and it replaced whale oil, but this would change soon. Standard stayed out of the production because it was booming bust. They just did the refining and a lot of the oil would blow up on people and so they wanted to be the standard to create safe trust in the product. Eventually, there was oil discovered outside of Pennsylvania in Ohio, but there was a lot of sulfur in it so it didn’t go mainstream, but John Dee believed and found a chemist who removed the sulfur he bought the oil $.15 and store it against the beliefs of many who worked with him, but he convinced them, and once they develop this innovation of removing sulfur, the price skyrocketed. he hated being exposed to the price of oil and didn’t like the uncertainty and drilling, but realized he had to vertically integrate. He created a monopoly 85% of supply but did this because he needed control or else the business was too unpredictable. He saw it as passing low prices and thought he was doing a good thing. Scale economies shared.
- Standard oil professionalized the oil industry. John D Rockfeller was a hungry businessman who learned a lot from his dad. Great mind for math and very entrepreneurial. Rockefeller was very detail oriented, and we always talk to himself and be very aware of his mental state. These businesses were always under capitalized except for Rockefeller and that’s how he dominated. He first thought producing oil was the money, but then realized refining was. After the Civil War American became a market economy, and there is a massive bull market Rockefeller took advantage of. Always maintain a strong cash position position to take advantage of downturns and never get wiped out. Flagler joined Rockfeller and their cooperation was key to their innovation. Cooperative capitalism. Their partnership was massive to their success. Rockefeller ability to get freight rebates a huge advantage. Even their competitors ended up having to pay rebates to them massive competitive advantage. Use joint stock company as way to fuel into business, which was a new invention. Standard we’re trying to buy out or crush all competition. South improvement company was Cabal between railroads and freight shipping companies. If they didn’t sell, they cut prices willing to lose money to put them out of business to make an example.
- Drake, the guy who discovered oil died poor and pennyless. He was a terrible businessman and lost everything. Man was given the power of light. Speculators flooded I n. Supply initially didn’t meet demand and a lot of people went out of business, but then long-term oil replaced all other forms of energy to power the world. Decisive victory. Price is fluctuated like crazy and money came in as many became very rich. The country needed to export oil as cotton experts with zero after the Civil War. also Wall Street speculators jumped in going crazy with new companies being developed every day. Crazy speculation. Town went from 0 to 15 K people in one year land sold for $2 million after being worth nothing then 10 years later everything dried up and that land was sold for five dollars classic boom bust. The crazy environment captured pop culture with songs being sung about oil. Teamsters unions owned transportation, and this made shipping impossible so the pipeline was invented. The team fought against it, but it was so cheap that their corruption was outdone. Complex markets developed and speculation on futures markets went rampant.
- Rise of oil led by capitalism and business where its boom bust risk and return nature incentivized people to get rich or die trying. Oil also important for its use as a fuel during war capture of oil fields and use of oil to have better machinery defined success. Oil governs how we live makes us plastic allows us to live in suburbs. We’re very reliant on oil. George Bissel saw oil could be used to replace coal but wasn’t sure. Saw this as an opportunity to be rich and engaged many scientists to learn more. The study by George silliaman whose dad was basically the inventor of American chemistry was commished to do a study that confirmed oil could in fact be used as a coal replacement. This helped them raise money. They knew that oil had value but didn’t know if there was enough in Pennsylvania to make it worth it. In ancient times in the Middle East people used oil like substances for everything from building materials to fire creation. Was in the fortified walls and baskets. This oil knowledge has been discovered but was lost to the west more or less with time with a cottage industry in Eastern Europe but nothing crazy. The Vienna lamp was the first lamp for burning kerosene. the menu oil would be great but couldn’t dig for it and they invented the concept of drilling for it. Drake was drilling for oil. People thought he was crazy. Had one week left of funds and in that week they struck oil. People flooded into Titusville. With advent of drillling there was too much supply and no demand. Barrels to store oil went up 2x. People flooded in was a crazy boom
