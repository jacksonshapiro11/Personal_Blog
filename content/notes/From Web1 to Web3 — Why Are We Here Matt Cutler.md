### Highlights

- Embrace Complexity for Opportunity
  Summary:
  Research indicates that Web3 fees reached $5.2 billion in the last year, heavily influenced by the price of Ethereum, which constitutes more than half of these fees.
  This evolving landscape presents significant opportunities for building protocols rather than products. The complexity of gas fees has increased from one-dimensional to potentially multi-dimensional scenarios, necessitating a robust system for navigating this complexity in an interoperable environment.
  The introduction of the gas network aims to create an Oracle platform for real-time gas market conditions across different chains.
  Addressing the less glamorous, foundational issues of on-chain interoperability is crucial, and there is much work to be done in this area.
  By focusing on building essential infrastructure and problem-solving, participants in the Web3 space can uncover substantial investment and development opportunities.

  Speaker 1
  We did our own on-chain research, and we're pretty confident the actual number spent on Web3 fees in the past 12 months is $5.2 billion. Another number that everybody is surprised by when I share. An easy way to think about it is every 100,000 ETH that gets burned, at $3,000 ETH, it's about $1.2 billion of fees. So ETH is more than half of all the Web3 fees, but obviously there's a lot more out there. And there's sort of three guarantees in life now, death taxes and Web3 fees. You can't escape them. And so when we're thinking about what to build, what to make a utility of, as Arjun said, we think that there's a whole bunch of opportunity around this. And by the way, at BlockNative, so I've been building for six and a half years, I am oftentimes challenged to build the right way, the new way, the modern way. And Arjun said it really, really well, which is build protocols, not products. And so we see this really interesting set of opportunities around gas is growing in complexity. Matt talked about this. Gas was one-dimensional, and then it became two-dimensional in 1559, and now it's three-dimensional in 4844. And right now, about to get four-dimensional with pre-confirmations. And as we look ahead to Pectra, it's going to get multi-dimensional. And that's just Ethereum alone. And all this stuff is going to need to get navigated in an increasingly interop world. And so we're trying to do something about it. This is the first time it's ever being talked about publicly. We're introducing the gas network. And the whole idea of the gas network is take the gas markets and put them on chain. And so it's basically an Oracle platform that you can basically get the real-time market conditions from any chain to any chain. And by the way, if you want to check this out, gas.network is the URL. I'm really proud of that one. And I talk about this in the context of this whole big picture because while there are these big opportunities going on out there, there's also a lot of small work that needs to get done. And so as you're building, as you're looking for opportunities, as you're looking for investment ideas, a lot of this sort of under the covers unsexy stuff is going to need to get addressed And there's a ton to do. There's a ton to do. And so we think this is necessary stuff for on-chain interoperability. And we're at DevNet now, we're at TestSet soon, and we really want feedback on this. And so as we think about the big picture and why we're here, I also encourage everyone to think about the problems to solve. Be labs and a shared governance model. I'll go through that. So that was my extended journey from Web 1.0 to Web 3.0. ([Time 0:24:07](https://share.snipd.com/snip/556af9d6-20fc-4872-ba25-b5cdd885d372))
