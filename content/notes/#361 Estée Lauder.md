  Is it then intelligence? Certainly intelligence helps, but it's not necessarily the education or the kind of intellectual reasoning needed to graduate from the Wharton School of Business that are essential. How many of your grandfathers came here from the old country and made a mark in America without the language, money, or context? What then is the mystical ingredient? It's persistent. It's that certain little spirit that compels you to stick it out just when you're at your most tired. It's that quality that forces you to persevere. Find the route around the stone wall. It's the immovable stubbornness that will not allow you to cave in when everyone says give up. Just before we decided to commit ourselves to cosmetics full-time, our accountant and lawyer took us out to dinner. They had something grave to tell us. Don't do it. That was the advice. The mortality rate in the cosmetics industry is high, and you'll rule the day that you invested your savings and your time into this impossible business. We beg of you. Don't. Do it. We did it. We make the business decisions. One else. We make them. Mark Twain once said, keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions. Small people always do that. But they're really great. Make you feel that you too can become great. ([Time 0:03:42](https://share.snipd.com/snip/de460b57-1ce9-442a-98f5-c5fcd182af90))
    - **Note:** Keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions. Small people always do that, but the really great make you feel that you, too, can become great. - mark twain. Business is something you marry something you love. People told her not to get in cosmetics. It was high failure. She just gritted it out and was successful. she started at a kiosk and built around things that wouldn’t change. She made beauty her life work it has been prevalent from ancient Egypt and people feel better when they look better they have more respect for themselves. People want to look good so they feel good. Love, wars and empires are built on beauty and it’s an ever present quality. She’s a world class sales person passionate about beauty from the day she was born.

  Speaker 1
  And it's obvious if you read Estée's autobiography she does not lack for confidence or self belief. You're as beautiful as you think you are, she would tell me. The secret is to imagine yourself the most important person in that room, the person everyone else is waiting to see. If you imagine it vividly enough, you will become that person. And if you could see the notes that I left myself throughout the book, a lot of them are just, I repeat over and over again, the fact that she was born for this business that she was in, that It's really important to pick a career that you have an immense passion about. In fact, I love what the advice that Charlie Munger gave, where he said, in my whole life, I've never been good at something I wasn't very interested in. It just doesn't work, there's no substitute for strong interest." He could be speaking about and describing Estée Lauder. "...My very first memory is that of my mother's scent, her aura of freshness, the perfume of her presence. My first sensation of joy was being allowed to reach up and touch her fragrant and satiny skin. Her hair didn't escape my attention either. As soon as I was old enough to hold a brush, I'd give her no peace." Estée, you've already brushed my hair three times today. I can still hear her complaining. My older sister Renee submitted to getting her face padded with my mother's cream. My sister-in was perpetually saint-like in her submission to my treatments. All of this annoyed my father considerably. Stop fiddling with other people's faces, he'd say. But that is what I like to do. Listen to this paragraph, it's insane. ([Time 0:11:03](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8d1bee65-25af-414b-bd57-9f967d78970f))
    - **Note:** Her mother instilled Self belief from a young age, and she always loves beauty from when she was child. She believed and loved beauty and was obsesssd from the age of 8. When you love something you never quit. By endure we conquer. She learned from his uncle John how to make face creams as he was a skin specialist and this was a formative experience. Power of believing in a young person. Wherever she went, she brought her creams and would put them on people. She cared about this more than popularity or anything. She gets married young and is always passionate about make up and beauty, but does it as a hobby until she’s 38 and raises her kids. She’s always going to this hair salon and then bringing people home to give them makeovers after and the owner of the hair salon notices this and invites her to have a kiosk at the salon. She asked to meet with her and get samples. The woman said Raul try them later, but essay is a master sales person and extrovert and asks for 5 minutes to demonstrate. Power of demonstration. She makes the sale on the spot gets a kiosk for rent at the salon where she has to pay rent but has full ownership. She never had partners risk taking is the cornerstone of empires no one ever became a success without taking chances. She had a deep understanding of human nature and built around simple principles.
- Risk and Reward: The Foundations of Success
  Summary:
  Successful entrepreneurship relies heavily on risk-taking, as demonstrated by Estée Lauder's journey from modest beginnings to significant achievements.

  Lauder's innovative sales strategy, involving gifts with purchase and free samples, exemplifies the power of creating customer connections.
  This approach not only enhances customer experience but fosters loyalty, underscoring the importance of cultivating relationships in business.

  No partners. I never did have partners. I would risk the rent, but if it worked, I would start the business I always dreamed about. Risk taking, this is one of my favorite sentences in the entire book. Risk taking is the cornerstone of empires. No one ever became a success without taking chances. And this is one of the most remarkable things about Estée Lauder and why, you know, I'm trying to like shout from the rooftops, please study her, like read her biography, listen to the Episodes I've done on her over and over again. She understood this by instinct, this fundamental understanding of humans, human nature, and then combining that with building her business on a handful of simple principles. One of the most important things she will ever do, again, if you're going to want to go from $50,000 of sales in your first year to, you know, multiple, you know, 16 billion, 70 years later, Customer loyalty over everything else, customer loyalty over everything else. She just understood this. And so she invents, at least she claims to, and I haven't found any examples of other people doing this. She claims to invent the sales technique of the century, which is giving gifts with purchase. And in sometimes giving gifts even without a purchase. This is so powerful. Now the big secret. I would give a woman a sample of whatever she did not buy as a gift. It might be a few teaspoons of powder in a wax envelope. Perhaps I'd shave off a bit of lipstick and tell her to apply with her fingers. ([Time 0:22:02](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9fe28f67-2194-4b4d-bd10-1df007a0103b))
    - **Note:** Her big sales innovation was giving gifts with purchases. Create an cultivate customer loyalty even if they don’t buy anything she’d give free make up when that person went home and tried it they’d love it and come back. Les Schwab would change tires for free because when the person had to come back to buy tires, it would likely come to him. Power of reciprocity. Bugatti hand built a part for an old car and sold it at cost. Sam Walton when someone returned something would give them a product for free before they left. Customer loyalty over everything. Create a devoted client. Word move fast and she was also in the right place. Women went to the salon to look beautiful and why not improve their face and hair. Being in the right place. She worked from 9-6 never take lunch. When she was traveling she was by the pool teaching everyone about beauty. She had a deep passion she was obsessed constantly working because she was passionate about beauty this made her a master salesman but destroyed her marriage. She acted quickly without introspection, which was great for business, but horrible for personal relationships. She’s constantly thinking about business never really talking to him and this leads them to get divorced but they get back together very quickly and stay together for 50 years. She called this the saddest day of her life. Her husband also runs a business which isn’t really working, so they decide to both work at her business and make it a family business so they’re constantly spending time together and have things to talk about which saves the relationship
- Persistence Breeds Innovation
  Summary:
  Despite facing skepticism from friends and family, the commitment to persevere led to the development of a unique marketing strategy for Estee Lauder Cosmetics.
  By leveraging the power of word-of-mouth among women, a potent and effective distribution method was established, enabling the product to gain traction before even reaching the salon. The insight highlights an unwavering belief in the beauty business, emphasizing that as long as women exist, there is a market opportunity.
  This confidence, coupled with an obsession for beauty and detail, informed critical decisions, such as packaging design, further solidifying the brand's foundation.

  Speaker 1
  Friends and family didn't let a day go by without discouraging us. Despite all the naysayers, there was never a single moment when I considered giving up. That was simply not a viable alternative. I had a secret weapon, this is very fascinating. Keep in mind we are in 19, I think it might be in the 1940s at this point. I had a secret weapon. There were in those days before television and high gloss advertising only two key ways to communicate a message quickly. The telephone and the telegraph. I came up with a third and it was potent. Tell a woman. Women were telling women. So word of mouth was her base. That was her initial distribution. Women were telling women, they were selling my cream before they even got to my salon. Tell a woman was the word of mouth campaign that launched Estee Lauder Cosmetics. And it's something she's going to use over and over again, as we'll see. And she makes another point in addition to this, there's just no way she's going to quit. But she says, I knew there was a business in beauty as long as there was a woman alive. Every day I touched 50 faces. So I think by now you've heard her say a few times that she was obsessed with beauty and obsessed with details. And this is a combination of the two when she's deciding what the packaging, what the jars of her cream will look like. And so this is how she makes the decision. First of all, I reasoned, where would my jars sit? ([Time 0:30:55](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7d9855b4-9be6-458c-a5b4-efdb451d1590))
    - **Note:** She created a new go to market and that wasn’t telephone or telegraph but tell a woman. Direct to consumer. Success took a while, and there was discouragement for many in the early days. She cried more than she ate. She tries to break into sacks For a while and her customers are constantly asking sacks for her products and she’s constantly beating them over the head with it and one day she gets a small order and this is the turning point in her life. She was obsessed with everything she spent months coming up with the right packaging going into every bathroom she could comparing it to the wallpaper, trying to find a color that worked in all environments. When she finally gets into sacks she bets big on Manufacturing. When she got in the first one, it worked and slowly, but surely she started to roll out and when she did, she would go to the counter personally and show the people who work there how to use the products.
- Empower Through Beauty, Never Underestimate Desire
  Summary:
  Training and commitment to detail are essential for success in the beauty industry, as demonstrated through personal engagement with customers.
  Direct interaction can create profound connections and transform perceptions, challenging assumptions about potential buyers based on appearances. Every woman has a desire for beauty, regardless of their background, emphasizing the necessity of not being patronizing.
  The story illustrates the impact of personalized service and the innovative strategy of offering free makeovers as a means to connect and drive sales, reinforcing the philosophy that true success involves understanding and valuing every customer's aspiration.

  She'd spend like a week or two there, launch every single store personally to make sure that all the people are trained right and they were doing things to up to her expectations. Slowly, a woman made her way towards us. She was short, swarthy, and definitely out of her element. She had no shoes and two gold teeth. She stopped directly in front of the counter. Then she pointed to one jar and looked up expectantly. I was about to assist her when the salesperson tapped me on the shoulder. Not her, Mrs. Lauder. Don't waste your time. She's not going to buy anything. I know her type. I whirled around. Since when do you know how much money she has in her I asked. I went to work first the cleansing oil which I patted on and immediately took off then the cream pack then the super rich all-purpose cream. I worked all of it in and then removed the excess and then handed her a mirror. She stared and stared and then smiled. She couldn't speak English. I couldn't speak Spanish. Still, at that moment, I felt such a bond with that woman and she and I both marveled at the miracle of makeup. You know the ending to this story before I write it. She bought two of everything I used on her face and the next day her relatives did the same. I never forgot her. She symbolized so much for me. Never be patronizing. Never underestimate any woman's desire for beauty. That proud woman embodies my entire philosophy. How bad do you want it? I would open each store myself. I might have to travel by bus, train, or donkey. But I'd be there for a week to train the salespeople to set out the merchandise and to create the aura. And then that was another description of this free sales, this free sample sales technique that she pioneered the free makeover she just gave that woman with no shoes and gold teeth. ([Time 0:37:13](https://share.snipd.com/snip/22fd1fef-03da-4ce3-bbae-b66ac4759d7d))
    - **Note:** A woman comes in where she’s opening a counter with a few teeth, looking rough, and the sales clerk discourages her from helping, but she gave the full demo, and the woman ended up buying two of everything then brought her family back to buy stuff. Don’t judge a book by its cover or underestimate people. She opened every store and stayed there for a week to train new employees. She used her marketing budget for free samples. Starting older gave her the advantage of focus and speed because she knew she had less time so she had to have tunnel vision. She would travel by train, and if she saw someone sitting alone should go up to them and give them a demonstration. Always selling. Starting older made her wise and focused. She still receives mail from people who she gave a makeover to on the train. Life changing moment of beauty. Those customers wrote to her also evangelized her they became her marketing department. Compounding relationships. She would go talk to other people in other departments and have them talk about her product. She would tell the person selling hats to recommend a shade of her lip stick. She’d go to other departments and give free samples and pitch her product. This gave her leverage. Have your customers evangelize you. Relentlessly resourceful.
- Relentless Resourcefulness: Transform Challenges into Opportunities
  Summary:
  Resourcefulness is a key driver for success, particularly in challenging circumstances.
  Instead of limiting efforts to a specific area, engage with various departments and create partnerships that elevate product visibility. Building relationships with sales staff across different sections can lead to cross-promotional opportunities, enhancing the appeal of products through complementary sales suggestions.
  Consistent engagement with media and influencers is crucial for maintaining a brand’s presence, regardless of external economic factors.
  The belief in finding opportunities in every business climate inspires a proactive approach to market presence and customer connection, emphasizing that persistent efforts can yield results even during downturns.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And so the relentless resourcefulness doesn't stop there. So you're you know, you're launching your Estee Lauder, you're inside of a department store, right? You're at the cosmetics counter. Do you think she stops at the cosmetics counter? No, she does not. She goes to the when she's launching a store, she'll go to every other department, say they're selling dresses or hats. What are the cases? She'll make friends the people, she'll give them free samples and say, hey, when you sell that hat, mention a new shade of lipstick might look good with the hat. I can make friends with saleswomen selling hats, and she might suggest to her customer that a free makeup at the Estee Lauder counter would enhance the new hat immeasurably. And the dress salesperson might mention to her customer that Estee Lauder has the perfect shade of lipstick to wear with the new dress. I would induce the whole store to speak for my products. More relentless resourcefulness from her. The point was to keep thinking, to keep placing the products in the public eye, to keep devising new ways of capturing the consumer's attention. During the week I usually spent at an opening promotion, I made it my business never to leave town without seeing every beauty editor of every magazine and newspaper I brought them samples Made up their faces gave them beauty advice. I promoted beauty and made friends. There is no such thing as bad time She's doing this, you know in a they were telling her during like economic downturns that she's gonna be in trouble This is her response. There's no such thing as bad times. I kept telling myself there is no such thing as bad business Business is there if you go after it. ([Time 0:42:06](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0e2209c7-b9ff-4e1c-b1e3-591b30796804))
    - **Note:** Relentlessly resourceful should we talk to every beauty editor all the people in the other departments at the store to help evangelize her product through free samples and telling her story. Constantly finding unique ways to market. There is never a bad time she was selling fine during a recession. Go out build relationships make friends no town was too small for her. Never underestimate the value of an ally. She had a woman who would refer her to other people, and then she called instantly while it was top of mind. Make the buyers your allies. Women wouldn’t buy perfume for themselves, but they would buy bath oil so she made a perfume type bath oil. Posotioned so women would buy it they’re basically selling cake for breakfast and calling it a muffin. She refused to choose business or family. Always had her children involved in the business
- Persistence Paves the Path to Success
  Summary:
  Persistence in the face of rejection is essential for business success.
  The journey of entering a prestigious market like Harrods exemplifies the power of relentless follow-up and creative strategies. Building awareness through media attention and engaging beauty editors can generate demand even before a product is available.
  Each rejection is an opportunity to refine the approach, foster relationships, and remain visible in the industry.
  Ultimately, consistent efforts can transform initial failures into future opportunities, leading to successful product placements and capturing market interest.

  But he said, you know, a million dollars doesn't sound like too much, we should keep going. And today, the market cap somewhere around $30 billion. And then when Est wants to expand into Europe, the way she does, I think is really smart. So she says, I'm going to start with the finest store in London, which at the time was Harrods. And she thought if I could get my products inside of her Harrods, and all the other great stores in Europe would follow. And so she goes and pitches the buyers at Harrods, the first meeting, the buyer is simply not interested. And so Estée does exactly what she does when she's in town to launch anything, even though at this time she was unsuccessful getting into her products in there. She goes and she says a little media attention was called for. I visited the beauty editors of various magazines. And she convinced the beauty editor at Harper's Bazaar to write a piece about her products. And they agree, but then they ask her, okay, well, what store in London would, are your products available? And she says, my products are not available in London. And she replies, okay, that's fine. I'll write a piece saying that Estée Lauder's cosmetics will be coming soon. The article comes out, it's well received. Estée goes back to the buyer at Harrods. Again, I went. Again, the answer was no, there was no space at this time. There was no call for my products. This wasn't the right time of year, maybe another time. I had to keep trying. I stayed in England another month visiting every beauty editor to make my name known I was getting write ups but no order from Harrods. The next year I go back to London and I go back to Harro She was not, the buyer was not quite as hostile at this time. She says let me tell you I have no room but as I told you before but perhaps I could take a tiny order and put it in with the general toiletries. It won't be next to the good cosmetics. That you'll have to understand. It was not a victory yet. I visited every one of the beauty editors again to remind them of me. Another round of makeups, another round of samples. Do you think you might write another piece? I asked them. Now they're were in London and Harrods. The articles appeared. Customers also appeared. Women began asking for Estee Lauder. The Harrods buyer was reluctant to notice, but she had no choice. The flush of a good week's sales, I summoned up Courage to ask if she could give me a more important counter. Oh no, she said. Other counter space is definitely not available. That's fine. Six months later, I made a third trip to London. I met with the buyer again. Well, we seem to have many London women asking for your products, she grudgingly admitted. I I'll give you a small spot at a more prestigious counter. And that is how Estee Lauder came to Europe. This relentless way that she follows up this relentless way that she draws attention to her brands and gets other other people, other customers to ask, you know, through the media, Through her own clientele is something she does over and over again. ([Time 0:48:40](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f58637e0-17b8-4203-8445-13fe50f0100b))
    - **Note:** She wants to go to Europe and no, she hast to go to Harrods first it takes her years to break in and constant persistence. She works with beauty editors to get positive reviews and create customers asking for her product and eventually the buyer has no choice, but to include her product in a good spot.
- Selling Yourself Is Key to Business Success
  Summary:
  Expanding into new markets requires adaptability and a willingness to innovate.
  When faced with resistance, proposing a consignment model allows for low-risk collaboration, fostering trust with potential buyers. The importance of personal connection in sales is paramount; authenticity and hands-on engagement can significantly influence success.
  It is crucial to not only create great products but also to effectively market them.
  A strong business foundation is built by understanding one’s voice and style, which is refined through experiences, both good and bad.
  As businesses evolve, maintaining focus on core strengths and resisting pressure to conform to industry trends can lead to sustained success.

  Speaker 1
  So she wants to expand into Canada. The buyer at this department store is like, no, like the cosmetic department is spoken for, we have all these exclusives. And she's like, okay, well, what not a cosmetic, you need bath oil. Why don't you stock my youth do so she says you need a bath oil woman would love to come into a department store instead of a drugstore to buy it. Look, buy it on consignment. If you sell it, fine. If you don't, you've lost nothing. Oh, okay, he said, but send me just a few bottles and only the oil. You know, she's not going to do that. So I was wrapping up the bath oil to send to Canada. I decided to put a few creams in with a note. Take these on consignment also, you certainly wouldn't want to have to say no to any woman who asks if you have everything if you have anything else in this line, right? And his response was what about our exclusive with other companies? What about my lack of space? What about what about what about he sputtered when I spoke with him later on? Look, you must go with the trend and with the world. Everyone is using the bath oil and these creams in America. You don't have to pay me for them until you sell them." Oh, okay fine, he said in resignation. When I came to make a personal appearance at the opening of Estée Lauder in Canada, my sales department had sent everything. The bath oil, the cologne, the cream, little boxes of powder I could give away as gifts. We sold out of everything. The buyer came down to see me after three or four days. How did you do this? He said. Don't sell cosmetic. He responded you sell yourself? It all goes back to what she said. I've never worked a day in my life without selling if I believe in something I sell it and I sell it hard. She has an entire chapter on selling It is not enough to have the most wonderful product in the world. You must be able to sell it one person with definitive ideas and pride in their product and a hands-on approach can lay the foundation for a strong business. Creating a great product is an accomplishment. Making people aware of its existence, let alone getting them to try it, is sometimes harder to do than to create it in the first place. Combine this with her unique philosophy about building a business that's authentic to her goes back to what the gentleman in Canada was saying, oh, you don't sell your products, you Sell yourself. This is what Estée said, each business person must find a style, that voice that grows clearer and louder with each success and failure. Observing your own successes and failures makes your inner business voice more sure and vivid. She continues and she states what she learned about building and beauty works for all products during the acquisition binges of the 1970s. We saw business firms becoming conglomerates. There was pressure for us to do the same. The louder inner voice said no stick to what you know best and don't change it. ([Time 0:51:25](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d6980161-8a16-4856-a1f0-b20e8af537ee))
    - **Note:** When she broke into Canada, she was selling herself, agreed for the clerk to get her one product on consignment, and then when she went to open up the entire line and sold out in three days, they had no choice, but to include her in the store. In the age of conglomerates, she always remain focused on beauty and what she did best. She listens to her obsession and never works a day in her life. Focused on what gave her energy which guided her true north. Love your career or find another. The secret of selling lies in the vendor, not the product and she loved her product so much that everyone had to buy it. Develop your own style and stick to it. Visualize and work like hell, toward it. If you spend time with pictures of failure in your mind, you will fail. She visualize success, created the reality in her mind, then brought that into the world. Believe proceeds achievement. Focus and don’t quit. She always went out and talked to customers.
- Focus Relentlessly to Achieve Your Dreams
  Summary:
  Success hinges on unwavering focus and the determination to act on dreams.
  Begin with a clear wish and couple it with passion, then engage in relentless work towards that goal. While serenity may be comforting, it lacks the thrill of achievement.
  The journey may be challenging, yet it promises profound fulfillment.
  Embrace the notion that potential is limitless and do not succumb to doubts about your capabilities.
  Maintaining a singular focus on your target—regardless of its scale—is crucial. Strive for perfection and never accept mediocrity; push yourself beyond perceived limits to attain your deepest aspirations.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And then finally she has some parting advice for you and I, which is focus and don't quit. First comes the wish. Then you must have the heart to have the dream. Then you work and work and work. From where you sit, you can probably reach out with comparative ease and touch a life of serenity and peace. You can wait for things to happen and not get too sad when they don't. That's fine for some, but not for me. Serenity is pleasant, but it lacks the ecstasy of achievement. Living the American dream has been intense, difficult work, but I couldn't have hoped for a more satisfying life. I believe that potential is unlimited. Success depends on daring to act on dreams. How far do you want to go? Go all the way. Within each person is the potential to build the empire of your wishes and don't allow anyone to say that you can't have it all. I've always believed that if you stick to a thought and carefully avoid distraction along the way, you can fulfill a dream. My whole life has been about fulfilling dreams. I keep my eye on the target. Whatever that target was, I've never allowed my eye to leave the particular target of the moment. Whether your target is big or small, grand or simple, ambitious or personal, I've always believed that success comes from not letting your eyes stray from the target. Anyone who wants to achieve a dream must stay strong, focused and steady. You must expect and demand perfection and never settle for mediocrity. If you push yourself beyond the furthest place you can go, you'll be able to achieve your heart's dream. ([Time 0:56:29](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3f07fa0b-291b-47b3-af6b-9b85e758a25f))
    - **Note:** Be focused and don’t quit you can live an easy life of happiness and serenity, but she chose to live the hard life of the American dream and worked her ass off every day to get there. Everyone has the potential to build an empire. It’s just about believing that you can and have the grit to do it.
