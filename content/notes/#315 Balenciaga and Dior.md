  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  She is the key to all of this which I didn't understand the first time I read this but as I once you finish this and you go back through you like oh she she was the key the whole time so her name is Isa. She set up as a dressmaker and taught the entire village a little village all the women in the village on how to sew Balenciaga at age three and a half. He joins her class and he winds up showing immediately astonishing skill with a needle so we saw this with Tiger Woods we saw this with Mozart you're going to see it over and over again you have some kind of level of innate talent for what you're doing and then you start unbelievably young he starts to three and a half he works in this industry till the day he dies or I guess right before he dies because he retired and then then died of a broken heart and so it says for the next 74 years he could and did so superbly and kept his hand in by doing a piece of sewing every day of his life that is insane sewing every day for 74 years I've never even heard of anything like that remind me of what Paul Graham said in his essay on episode 314 one of my favorite lines in the essay he said that being prolific is underrated in fact I said this in the Picasso episode so if you haven't listened to the Walt Disney and Picasso episode that is episode 310 that is based on the same book that I'm reading from and going over with you now this is about Balenciaga and Dior it's this book by Paul Johnson called creators it profiles I would ([Time 0:04:30](https://share.snipd.com/snip/383fbe10-57d8-4143-b60f-535f87b7a7cc))
    - **Note:** Balenciaga sewed every day from when he was 3 to his mid 70s. He makes a collar for his cat at 12 and a rich woman in the neighborhood saw it and introduced him to the right people the importance of getting your work out there. He also learned different techniques from his peers like cutting that gave him a cross disciplinary advantage. Kobe took ballet lessons. Public praises what happens in private. When he was starting up he positioned himself in the right places where his customers were this got him the attention of the Spanish royal family and he was making clothes for him then he moved to the English royal family then sacks 5th ave. You need to position yourself in the right situation for success. His dresses were built to last with ones he made still being passed down.
- Christian Dior: Standing Out and Defying Austerity
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  What a six years of war whatever it was now this is really important that I mentioned earlier industry specific talent tends to cluster in the same physical location and this is important because both Dior and Blenciaga would insist on the very best like subcontractors the people actually producing like the materials that they're using to make their creation so I'll get there in a minute but big thing that you're going to learn about Christian Dior is that you don't get to the top by fitting in you need to stand out this is the James Dyson approach right difference for the sake of it all this was in preparation for his first proper post-war collection this is Christian Dior now when his sensation was caused by an unknown designer that's Dior Dior was using prodigious quantities of precious materials and thumbing his nose up at wartime austerity And what's fascinating about Dior is he kind of comes out of nowhere right he just went from series of kind of one failure after another so let me give you background to to understand like how unique this was first of all this was fascinating so Dior's father was a successful businessman who ran a fertilizer factory his dad specialized in producing liquid manure another way to think about this is the foundation of the Dior empire was literally shit in the literal sense and what's crazy is 50 years from now right from where we are in the story Dior would be the beginning of Bernardo Knoll's LVMH empire if you haven't learned about that connection go back and listen to the the first of many episodes that I'll make on Bernardo Knoll it's episode 296 it's very fascinating and he's gonna come up a few times in Dior's story as well but back to his dad this idea where the fact the only reason that Christian Dior could afford like how he got to Paris was that his dad's liquid manure business was ([Time 0:16:12](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3dcf1709-4684-4075-9edf-8c6f1f10911d))
    - **Note:** After WW2 end people are looking for something new and fresh to turn the page and Dior comes in fresh and provides a completely counter positioned style to the austerity times of war this is a prime moment to launch something and he takes advantage. Dior was an artist but in a quick span his dad lost his entire business in the depression his mom died and his brother is committed to an insane asylum. This is his darkest time but provides him the launching pad for his career. Opportunity is a strange beast appears when you’re least expecting. This moment is when his growth is at its highest. Make yourself a big target for luck as you need luck in any successful endeavor. In his mid 40s he was just an average fashion designer, but he meets busacc who is a textile producer who wants to open a fashion house. Dior comes to him with an ambitious plan to be the best. Dior didn’t want a fashion house he wanted to go for great hiring the best most talented people and spending a lot of money deep commitment greatness doesn’t come cheap or without sacrifice and he was demanding this with basically no track record.

  Dior is pitching Boussak and this is a response Boussak like the idea and offered to set Dior up immediately with an investment of 10 million francs and this was later increased to 100 million francs and we see that Dior came out of the gates swinging remember what James laces said difference for the sake of it uh so it says Dior doubled the risk of opening a new house with his revolutionary quote unquote new look a deliberate and defiant return to the most extravagant use of material he spat in the face of post-war egalitarianism and said I want to make the rich feel rich again his first collection turned out to be the most successful in fashion history with no expense spared in endless trouble taken Dior recruited and continued to employ the best people to be found in France France men and women who would Die rather than turn out an article which was in the tiniest degree below the best in the world that is how you win the success of the house was immediate and prolonged and the volume of business continued to grow steadily in the 10 years up to Dior's death in 1957 by which time the house employed 1000 of the finest experts ever gathered together under one roof they are the Pixar of fashion houses during this decade Dior sold over 100 000 dresses made from 16 000 design sketches and using 1000 miles of fabric again another example that being prolific is underrated and another thing that being prolific does it increases your surface area of luck it was it's present and i think a lot of industries but it's explicit in the fashion industry it has to be understood that designers or courtiers never present just one Line they produce a variety of styles in each collection and though for publicity purposes they stress a particular favorite they know that in the end the magazine writers the big buyers and above all the individual customers will decide which is dominant the sheer volume that they produce being prolific increases your surface area of luck maybe think of a Picasso where you know Picasso is one of the most famous artists in history he produced 26 000 or whatever it was we only remember a few and somebody ([Time 0:23:34](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8aa6922c-8ddf-4660-ab81-8dad82bb77f4))
    - **Note:** Bousak backs him and dior goes bold turning out the most extravagant counter positioned fashion line which becomes the most successful in history he hired people who would rather die than turn out something substandard amassed thousands of experts the most fashion talent under one roof like Pixar to animation. Fashion designers produce a lot then double down on what works people forget the crap and extol the greatness. You can’t have a lot of good ideas without having a lot of bad but no one will remember the bad ones.
