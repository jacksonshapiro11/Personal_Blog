- Storytelling Principles and Self-Reflection
  Summary:
  The inner voice we possess plays a crucial role in shaping our destiny and it is essential to ensure that the stories we tell ourselves are empowering rather than limiting.
  To understand the impact of our self-narratives, we must first question if our stories are aligned with reality and if they resonate with the best version of ourselves. Additionally, it is important to evaluate if our stories lead us towards our desired goals, inspire optimism, and reinforce our capabilities.
  By deliberately crafting narratives that mirror our values and aspirations, we can positively influence our mindset and actions.
  Encouraging self-reflection on the stories we tell ourselves can guide us to navigate life more effectively and create a future that aligns with our true potential.

  Speaker 1
  But the more we have learned about the power of this inner voice in directing traffic, your inner voice pretty much as we've learned it determines your destiny. So I am every time I speak to my sons, every time I speak to my grandsons, I'm very careful that, is this what I want them to say to themselves when they start maturing in life? That was a game changer for me big time.
  Speaker 2
  What questions should we be asking ourselves to better understand if the story we're telling ourselves is empowering or limiting us?
  Speaker 1
  Again, it's there's this level of awareness. And I have tried in my career to raise the curtain so that people understand that there's something going on that, you know, maybe was purely automatic. And maybe the voice you got, you never really intentionally acquired. But suddenly you have this critic inside yourself or the storyteller that we all have. And you have to stop and reflect is this I have rules of storytelling. They're not really rules that are guidelines. And the first thing is the rule has to be true. Is this aligned with reality? So the first awareness, am I making stuff up here that just is convenient for the moment to maybe make me feel better? Or is this aligned with really objective reality? That's the first kind of principle of really good storytelling. Another one is, is this storage that I'm telling myself, is it aligned with the best part of me? With who I really want to be in life, my values, my sense of purpose? Does this story take me where I want to go in life? Does it help me feel more optimistic and hopeful about my future? Or does it in fact give me a sense that, you know, I'm not that capable, world is tough. I probably can't make it. Why am I doing this? This is stupid. And so I really want people to have this kind of automatic sensor before you allow these stories to take form that you intentionally, purposefully, orchestrate them so that these stories Are aligned with the best part of you. And if they were made known publicly to all the people that you know, or put on a jumbo Tron, you would be proud of the way you have been coaching yourself, talking to yourself about what's The storm that you're in or about the future that you're crafting. And I'm very hopeful that the more we can bring an awareness to people's lives, I have changed so many people's thinking about so many things in sport and outside of it. And it's basically the question you ask, which is how do we make our stories really, really help us navigate better in life? ([Time 0:06:07](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7a3398ec-54f4-4f2f-9107-c9e080081f71))
    - **Note:** When you’re telling yourself a story ask if this story is helping and motivating you or detracting and hurting you. These stories define us. How do we shape our stories to improve our lives. Sometimes you need people who believe more in you than you believe in yourself. We never know when we’ll do something that will have a profound effect on someone but we can only be successful through thick not thin desires. There is no greater lift than reshaping the story you tell yourself and you can do this by handwriting and recording your voice and listening back to it.
- Crafting Positive Narratives for Personal Growth
  Summary:
  Crafting positive narratives about oneself, such as changing from a limiting story to a empowering one, can help in personal growth and development.
  By rewriting personal stories from memory and listening to them, individuals can rewire their brain's neural pathways. Engaging in handwriting these stories has been found to be more powerful than typing on a computer.
  Through the process of narrative crafting, confidence, belief, and success can be cultivated.
  Writing, through methods like journaling, not only helps in reflecting but also leads to new idea generation and deeper understanding.
  Many historical figures have used writing as a tool for personal development. Journaling can transform one's mindset, turning challenging days into opportunities for growth and learning.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  He's at the University of Texas. And I mean, it's incredible the kind of success on the protocols he's had in helping people overcome trauma with their hand, with writing, with writing skills. But we found that creating the story that works for you with your hand and rewriting it several times from memory and then reading it and even using the voice memo on your phone where you Actually tell yourself over the phone, your voice memo capability, and then you play it back and you listen to yourself coaching you. It's not having someone from the outside coaching you with their public voice. You are taking your private voice and making it public and now listening to it and trying to get a new way of having these neural pathways in your brain transfer information. And eventually, over time, the story begins to change. So it might be, I hate putting. I've never been a good putter in sport. And if I could just be a great putter, I would be on the PGA tour list and one of the top guys or women. But and then the story you tell yourself is I just don't seem to have the ability to be a good putter. I've always had trouble putting and I think this is my greatest never. So I say that you can't get there with that story. That story is so limiting. Here's the story that works for you. At this point in my life, the truth is if you look at my stats and one of the poor putters on the PGA tour or the LPGA tour, that's true. But I'm an athlete and I have to tell you, one day I'm going to become one of the best putters, if not the best putter, on tour. And I'll tell you why, because I am going to devote more energy, more effort. I'm going to make this the most important part of my game. And I'm going to love doing it. And every time I see a green, I'm going to light up and say, ah, fantastic. I have another chance to practice my putting and to get it right. And if I miss a putter, three footer for a birdie, I'll simply say, thank God I got that out of my system. Now I'm going to get better. And so you develop a running kind of narrative with yourself that builds confidence, builds belief, builds this and you start by crafting the perfect story with your hand. And the more your hand works, and that actually what we found, James Pinabaker hasn't found this though. But with our data collection, we found that it's more powerful to do it by hand than it is on a computer. And so we have everybody do it, you can print it, or you can cursive writing, however you want to do it. But we prefer that you do it by hand and each new iteration you do from memory. And then you compare with the last one. And then those that you're putting new energy into this network where stories are told around putting or around your marriage or around your intelligence, your confidence. And that's what we've done over the years. We've had so many astonishing successes. And I had no idea any of this was going to surface. It all took years of practice and data collection to refine it. And I feel very grateful to have had that opportunity, what I call a living lab for helping distill a lot of the mysteries of how this miraculous human system is engineered.
  Speaker 2
  I love the nature of writing. We encourage that with sort of decision journals and as the means by which we can reflect or one of the ways by which we can reflect. And one of the ways which we can learn to think as well. So not only do we discover through writing that we don't know what we're talking about always, but we discover new ideas and we come to a new understanding. It's so powerful as a form. And if you look through it history, most of the people who would we would consider the grades of history at one point or another have journaled.
  Speaker 1
  I completely agree. And it was something that I started with after learning about this with a lot of our clients and so forth. I started journaling and I mean I get up in the morning and I have to do it. It's almost like an addiction now. And I try to program my day and look at all the things. And when anybody asked me, you know, how am I feeling today? My response is if I'm feeling a little foggy and I have a headache or whatever, I'll say, you know, I have a little have a few things that are bothering, but I got to tell you, I'm excited About having another opportunity to push the needle to learn a little bit more. I'm grateful for this day. And if you put that down in writing, something magical happens is I could change the whole kind of template, the screen, the mindset you have for, you know, dealing with all the storms That you were inevitably going to face all day long. So it doesn't become a nightmare day. And that's it's a wonderful lesson. I'm a such a believer in journaling. ([Time 0:18:39](https://share.snipd.com/snip/22cec676-3593-4055-b7f0-833aa6c231c4))
    - **Note:** Crafting your story is vital how to do it. Change the mindset for dealing with the inevitable problems in life turn a possible nightmare day into a very successful one. What is the ultimate purpose what defines ultimate success in your life. Tie this ultimate mission to your success in life failure is not possible. Link everything to that purpose. Know your purpose and hold yourself to it every day.
- The Power of Inner Voice in Parenting
  Summary:
  The inner voice parents use when talking to themselves is often passed on to their children, shaping the children's self-perception and approach to life.
  Parents should assess their inner voice - is it supportive, or is it overly critical and harsh? The way parents talk to themselves can influence the way they talk to their children, impacting how children perceive themselves and handle life's challenges.
  It is crucial for parents to cultivate a positive and empowering inner voice to help nurture their children's belief in themselves, joy, and overall happiness.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And it almost looks as if it's coded in the genes because one generation passes on that inner voice to the next. Your public voice with your children become their inner voice. And if you talk to them in certain ways that are very destructive, demeaning, critical, sarcastic, even though your response is, hey, I'm not trying to be anything but a good parent That's going to help them face a tough world. I don't want to develop wusses. I'm not going to be all kindness and love and all that garbage. I'm going to be like a drill sergeant because life is tough. And their parents before them, they say kids today have way too easy. And you have to remember I'm the guy that wrote a lot of the books on mental toughness. So I'm not for the wussification of youth. Trust me. But what's so interesting is that the voice of your parents, unless you became very aware of it and intentionally changed it, you're going to bring that voice particularly under stress To your children. So the first the first issue is I want you to tune in to what kind of coach are you to yourself? What is your inner voice? Would you want your inner voice to be somehow incorporated into the head of your children? The way you speak to yourself? Are you proud of it? Is it helpful? Or is it a very almost sadistic adversary that's all you're never good enough? You never you never live up to what you really should. You're always falling short. You are a dumb head. And if you look where that probably came from, if you came from a very tough culture that may have been the way parents thought for a long time, that's how you raise tough kids. You just have a tough language, not realizing that that's really, you know, it's not what the evidence shows. You want them to be truthful, straight up. You may want them to have a voice that's, you know, at times really tough. And they pull themselves up by their bootstraps and they they don't they're not wimps. They're going to be strong and handle life's stresses in ways that would make them very proud. But it's not this harsh inner critic where they're actually fighting two battles all the time, one with the outside world and one with themselves. It's an exhaustive two front battle. And so we're trying to help parents understand what is your inner voice saying to you? And be very careful. If you don't think that's what you want in your son or daughter's head, be very careful what you're saying publicly to them. Because your public voice will one day be their inner voice, which controls their destiny, their belief in themselves, their joy and happiness in life. That's where it all plays out. ([Time 0:29:24](https://share.snipd.com/snip/08421411-c585-4993-bb84-fe69865af183))
    - **Note:** Parenting advice for kids. Your shaped by the stories your parents tell you and you shape your kids with the stories you tell them. You can’t fight on 2 fronts with the outside and inside world so you need to befriend your inner voice life is hard enough as is. The inner critic helps no one.
- Effective Communication with Kids
  Summary:
  To effectively communicate with kids and reach their inner core, it is important not to preach or give direct advice but rather share personal anecdotes and stories.
  By sharing experiences and different perspectives, parents can influence their mindset gradually over time. With the prevalence of social media affecting kids' self-esteem and vulnerability to online criticism, parents need to limit social media exposure and provide counterbalances to help them navigate these challenges.
  Building resilience and self-esteem can be achieved through mentoring programs where kids who have overcome difficulties can guide and support others.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So the issue is how do you get through to this inner core of a person to their inner voice, this control central? Because your kids can just shut you out. They hear you, but they don't really, it doesn't register. And sometimes they hear their peers much more powerfully than they're going to hear you, particularly after they reach a certain point where they're starting to strive for independence. They kind of lock out a lot of adult messaging. But what kids don't want to be is preached to. They don't want to be preached to the great wisdom seekers in our history when they were trying to, let's say in the American Indian tradition, they would tell stories. They tell stories that actually don't bring defensiveness. What defensiveness does, it means I'm locking you out. I don't, you're threatening me with your bloody preaching. And so the more parents can say, I'll just give you a quick little anecdote here about my life that I learned. And you give them a mindset, say, you know, I had, I was not a good student. I actually hated school. And one day I had a teacher who took me aside and said, listen, I don't know what your issue is, but you seem to be angry every time you come in the classroom. And you don't want anyone to call on you. There's no joy here. And I would just like you to think about this. I've had lots of students like this. And you know, there is a joy in learning if you, if you can dig it out. And you provide them with a little different perspective, you know, Carol Duac, the brilliant developmental psychologist who developed this notion of mindset. There's a way to look at something. And they may not really look like they're hearing it the first time you say it, but it may register because even when you're saying it, they may not allow it into the inner recesses of this Command center. But you're hoping that over time that mindset will begin to change as opposed to being a victim. Kids don't like me. And what's happening on social media for so many kids is actually, it's a tragedy. They're getting so beaten up. Their self esteem is so fragile. You know, kids are not held accountable for what they say. And they can't see them when this digital criticism comes across. They can't shake it. That's why so many kids today are struggling. Their self esteem is like so fragile. They're only as good as the last post that came up. And when someone just gives them a chilling source of feedback, no matter how untrue, you can't stop it because it comes from their peers. And they're so vulnerable. Parents have to be very careful about, particularly in the early years, how much time they allow their kids on social media. And they have to be able to put some counterbalances in there in ways that they don't get blocked out because that's what happens. Parents, we're working on a board and a program for young people. It's called the Youth Performance Institute. And we're recruiting kids who've been through all kinds of really challenging moments. And really have come through on the other side of it. And we're using them as mentors for kids who are struggling. And so we believe that the best way to get to kids is through the mentoring of other kids who have been through the wars and have figured out answers. You know, the more you realize that there is such a powerful destructive force, there are some positive benefits from social media. But it's like touching a hot stove. You can use a stove to cook and to do all kinds of great things with, but it can burn the hell out of you. ([Time 0:34:05](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f11f354c-96ed-4032-ae76-5eb76cf315d4))
    - **Note:** The best way to express a belief is not through a direct message of you should improve this but an anecdote from your life that the person can understand and apply to their world less attaching more beneficial long term sympathy. People don’t want to be preached to. The way you present the story and how you bring in someone to the conversation walk them through your thinking don’t give decrees. Frame the conversation saying how would you feel if you got hit or friend killed by drunk driver instead of saying dont do it. Most really successful people had no clue they’d be successful it aaa right place and time with the right set of skills doing what they love. Fall in love with the learning process try a lot of things and find joy in seeking mastery if something you love.
- Unlocking Learning Through Personalized Interest
  Summary:
  Personalized interest plays a crucial role in enhancing learning outcomes, as seen in examples like children getting excited about reading Harry Potter or being encouraged to play music they enjoy.
  Providing children with the books or materials they are interested in can significantly impact their willingness and ability to learn. A real-world example illustrates how supplying classrooms with books that cater to the children's preferences led to remarkable improvements in their engagement and learning.
  Tailoring learning materials to individual interests can cultivate a genuine passion for learning and foster better educational outcomes.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I had a couple grandkids who were not that excited about reading, but their parents got them into Harry Potter. And Harry Potter is not an easy book to read. And all of a sudden, they had so much excitement or Star Wars reading about that stuff. And all of a sudden now they're reading books like crazy because they got them started into things they wanted to do. And maybe a music teacher wants you to learn all the classical music and you just roll your eyes and go, I hate this. And then you go, well, let's learn something you'd like to learn. And so they start playing things that really excite them and all of a sudden the learning curve goes off the charts. And maybe at some point, they're going to go back and want to play the classics. But if you start with something they're not that interested in, you may kill the golden goose.
  Speaker 2
  A real world sort of example of that in a different way. We used to buy books for classrooms. And so for schools that wouldn't buy the kids, the books that they want to read, because often the books in the classroom in grade two and three are sort of like hand me downs from like a Decade, but they have no relevance to the kids. So not the books they want to read. I realized this with my own son in grade three, which is a different story. And so we offered to buy classrooms like all the books the kids wanted to read. So they just had a selection of them. And we did I think we did this for 50 or so classrooms per year for like five years. And I still get emails from those teachers saying how unbelievable the difference in the children was when the books changed.
  Speaker 1
  That is absolutely brilliant. That's a brilliant way to intervene in a young child's life when they're so open to the possibilities that they could become something. That's exactly it.
  Speaker 2
  And I got this idea from my son who always never wanted to read. It was a huge reader. I think he read before he talked basically and still is the most prolific reader. I know, but he never wanted to read anything the school was telling him to read. And I always asked him why because I always thought it was like an authority thing. And for him, it was just like, no, it's really boring. Like, I don't want to read that. And I thought that was, well, what would make it more? And why aren't the books that you love to read? Because you clearly. And that was the that was the stimulus for you to do that for five years to bring all those books into the school. Yeah, because I was like, well, if this impacts him that way, it's probably and he was lucky because he had no problems reading. And I was like, well, all these other kids who are struggling. ([Time 0:49:28](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4e9a5f45-b358-4cf3-8df5-fba9e5cab38d))
    - **Note:** It’s important to find what you love and meet people where they are. Don’t get people to read philosophy but Harry Potter. Time only has value in its intersection with energy it becomes priceless with extrodinary energy you have full engagement. You need be engaged. With the time you have infuse energy toward the objective don’t go through the motions. Going through the motions doesn’t lead to success you need to be engrossed in it. It’s not about time it’s about energy or being present. Don’t focus on time but energy. We need to spend energy and recover a lot of energy. The healthier they are the better they do so how can you recover quickly to stay at it. Train recovery. Chronic stress is killing you but stress is life. So you need to maintain stress to build up your tolerance for it then build it more flywheel. Embrace and train your stress to raise your ability to compete at a higher level if you go easy eventually even easy model will be too hard.
- Intentional Rituals and Habitual Change
  Summary:
  Rituals, defined as intentionally acquired habits, serve a mission or goal, like enhancing performance or managing health.
  Humans are creatures of habit, wired to follow routines automatically, but possess the unique ability to pause between stimulus and response to create novel responses. By developing tiny intentional habits, individuals can rewire circuitry, introducing new behaviors that align with their desired missions and goals.
  Redirecting habits requires a significant investment of time and energy, driven by a powerful purpose, to break free from destructive routines and take control of personal outcomes.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  A ritual, as we define it, is an intentionally acquired habit that serves the mission, whatever the mission is. So to become a better tennis player between points, to become destabilized blood glucose during a match, what should you be eating? Maybe a banana drinking lots of water and some specific hydration elements between games on changeovers. You can have a ritual for getting up in the morning that you intentionally develop. It's kind of a tiny habit that you decide is going to help you navigate in life more successfully and the things that matter to you. We need rituals. I will tell you, it's called the unbearable automaticity of being. We are creatures of habit. And some of those habits just destroy us. I mean, they don't help us at all. We don't even know how we got them. We just some one day we won't woke up and this is how it is. We love to sleep late. We don't like to get up in the morning and on and on and on. And a lot of things just, you know, they just happen. But our days pretty much unfold automatically. You're going to do tomorrow pretty much what you are wired up habitually to do. Now, the beauty of being human is that we have the ability to pause between the stimulus and response and create a novel response. And that takes a certain amount of time and a lot of energy infusion until we rewire the circuitry. And it is a, it's basically it's a neurological loop that enables you to continue doing certain things. And in the animal kingdom, they're completely wired up with instincts and routines that enhance survival. But human beings actually can stop and reflect. I don't want to be 40 pounds overweight. I don't and then you have to link this mission, which is maybe very difficult to get off of drugs or whatever. You have to get a purpose that is so powerful that it just it just grabs you and ushers you into the storm and you will not surrender. And most of the time, it's these little tiny habits getting up at a certain time, setting the alarm and having breakfast always at a certain, even if it's a small amount, you get yourself Started rather than having a big lunch and then a huge dinner and going to bed. You start understanding, you know, you don't have to be a victim of your environment. You actually can intervene, but it takes a lot of heavy duty lifting. And it's all made possible by your energy investment intentional. ([Time 1:09:55](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a6e4590e-898c-45b2-a55d-b4da1e1c35f0))
    - **Note:** Humans can pause between stimulus and response and reprogram your brain. Rituals are habits that serve the mission. You don’t need to be a victim of your environment but you need to intervene and be mindful to intervene well. 70% of tennis your not playing he studied the biology in this 70% to understand who would win the 30% of playtime the ability to recover physically and mentally in between games and points was vital and predicted more success than anything that happened during a point. Recovery is everything. Mental toughness isn’t just mental it’s having a fully integrated mental physical and emotional body system that prepares you best for a situation. It’s not as much toughness as positioning and past experiences. When you want to be fearless you must look fearless you must project on the outside how you feel on the inside. Bullfighting.
- Control Fear with Physical Presence
  Summary:
  Fear can be controlled by exuding physical presence, as exemplified by bullfighters who display supreme confidence and dominance through their every movement, walk, and gaze in the arena.
  By projecting fearlessness outwardly, one can influence their internal chemistry positively. The emphasis on physical demeanor, such as posture, eye contact, and movement, can significantly impact one's ability to achieve their potential, showcasing the importance of integrating mental, emotional, physical, and spiritual elements to attain success in challenging situations.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  You have to really have the system has to bring out this amazing chemistry formula, which is not easy to mobilize, particularly in the context of pressure. So it's not mental toughness. It's mental, emotional, it's physical. It's actually spiritual as well. We are a fully integrated species. And we've got to understand that everything we do affects everything else. And even the way you speak to yourself, the way you walk, the way you carry your shoulders, I flew all the way to Spain because I got a fabulous opportunity to interview one of Spain's most Famous bullfighters, Martin Vescuas. He's now just passed away, but he was a superstar. And I begged for the opportunity to meet with him because I wanted to know how a matador controls fear when they know that there's this massive bull who is going to do everything possible To kill them and to subdue this potential threat that the bull is seeing. How do you control fear? How do you keep from being paralyzed? Because when you choke, you're very likely going to get gored and can very possibly die. And he smiles and he says, not obvious, Jim. And I said, no, I came all this way. It's not that obvious. And he said, have you ever seen a bullfighter in the ring show anything but supreme confidence? Have you ever seen them mope around with rounded shoulders saying, I'm having a bad day. I don't feel like I'm on my game today. The, you know, being negative or a little bit pessimistic and irritated at the ball because the ball is just not cooperating or whatever. You see nothing every step, every movement. He said, we start training as a young boy at a very early age on how to walk, how to turn, how to carry our shoulders, where to put our eyes. Every single detail is done meticulously. And he said, the bull can see that and knows that you have no fear and that you dominate the bull by your presence. We control fear by our physical presence. I was mesmerized by the whole thing and we looked at videos and it was really quite so I brought it back to the states to the Nick Voluntary Tennis Academy. And we showed all this video of bullfighters. And we developed what I call the Matador walk. And I would take tennis players out in the court and teach them how to walk, how to turn, how to look, how to control their eyes. And I will tell you, it had a profound effect. They thought it was a little weird in the beginning, but they saw the results they were getting and how they felt much more. If you want to be fearless, you look fearless. If you want to control the chemistry, you have to look on the outside the way you want to feel on the inside. And that was the inside. It's powerful.
  Speaker 2
  It also relates to the stories that we were talking about earlier. It sort of comes full circle.
  Speaker 1
  Right, exactly. You can control your chemistry from the inside out or from the outside in. You can work with meditation, with thoughts, with ideas, with private voice, you know, or you can work from the outside working with your actual physical muscles and the way in which You carry yourself all of it can either contribute or undermine your ability to achieve your potential.
  Speaker 2
  That's a really powerful way to take control, no matter where you where you are in this particular moment, you can always do something to sort of move forward. ([Time 1:16:17](https://share.snipd.com/snip/be89731f-af56-48df-ab12-4b1e06de45c1))
    - **Note:** When you want to be fearless you must look fearless you must project on the outside how you feel on the inside. Bullfighting. You can control your chemistry from the inside out or outside in meditation or working out and how you carry yourself
