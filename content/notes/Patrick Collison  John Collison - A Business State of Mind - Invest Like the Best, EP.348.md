### Highlights

- Episode AI notes
  1. Cultivating a high agency culture is important for a company to succeed and attract ambitious individuals. Examples like Apple and SpaceX demonstrate how strong cultures can continue even without their founders.
  2. SpaceX and Tesla have a high agency culture that focuses on what is possible from an engineering perspective. This culture is deeply ingrained within the company and goes beyond the influence of Elon Musk.
  3. Good cultures are unique and have strong beliefs and actions that differentiate them from other companies. They create a clear idea and attract others who resonate with their culture.
  4. Apple's success proves that a strong culture can persist even after the departure of its founder. ([Time 0:00:00](https://share.snipd.com/episode-takeaways/6986bf24-5713-47f5-8c2b-ce2c5b1e2f70))

    - **Note:** Crafting a company culture is vital you want high agency smart people running the show and deeply instilled in your culture. This organizational muscle lasts long after the founder is gone.
      Culture is strong and intentional and you need to build the foundational beliefs then grow. Good cultures are intentional and unique.
- Cultivating a High Agency Culture at SpaceX and Tesla
  Key takeaways:
  - SpaceX and Tesla have a high agency culture focused on what is possible from an engineering point of view.
  - Starbase, where SpaceX is located, faces issues with mosquitoes, so they breed dragonflies and build their own housing.
  - The high agency culture is not just associated with Elon Musk, but is deeply ingrained in the culture of the company.
  - Good cultures are often differentiators, with strong beliefs and actions that set them apart from other companies.
  - Apple has shown that a strong culture can persist beyond a founder.

  Speaker 1
  I think yes and no. I think yes, in the sense that I think a company should be the resonant frequency of some tuning fork, clearly run. Presumably, the founders are chronologically the first people to respond to that wavelength. But I think it has to be, it's only going to work if it then becomes an adlamoration of people who share that idea and turn the Apple example around. I think it's hard to argue that Apple hasn't pretty meaningfully sustained Vash, which Steve stood for. And so I think a company has to stand for an idea, but I don't think it's going to work if it's overly individuated.
  Speaker 2
  Another way to think about it is sometimes whilst people interpret as a very strong cultivar founder is just a company having a very strong culture, that the founder is a metonym for. Apple has this extremely strong design focus and the designers are quite central in the organ. It's this very functional design and there's probably, I don't know, 50, 100 designers who are extremely important in all of the products that happen. And Steve was a big part of inculcating that culture, but that's a culture that can, and indeed, Apple does exist separate from that. Another example I like is, Pash and I both visited Starbase for a launch. No, I haven't been to a launch. I'd love to go to a launch. On an on launch day, this is before they got their launch. You don't want to go to launch until all the flying conference. Exactly. Figure out that part. What really struck me is at SpaceX, I presume, as you know, Tesla and other companies, this is obviously very much the focus on what is possible from an engineering point of view and SpaceX And Tesla and various companies are customers. We kind of get this exposure at Stripe as well. But it's a really high agency culture. And so, for example, at Starbase, they're in the middle of nowhere, right on the border in Texas. And so they've all these issues with too many mosquitoes. So they're breeding dragonflies in paddling pools to eat the mosquitoes and obviously there's no housing there. So they're just building their own housing and they need energy. So they're deploying a solar farm and everything like that.
  Speaker 1
  The guy giving us the tour at some point, say, who's nominally the site manager?
  Speaker 2
  So walking past them building, they say, wait, who built that? I was just very impressed by the high agency culture, which, again, people associate with Elon, I think correctly. But at this point is cultural. We were asking, how do you solve problems? Who do you go to when you can't solve something? And the person we asked it of was confused. They're like, well, you just figure it out. And you just solve it. And so again, there's one that comes from talking to Elon. This was just something that now deeply exists in the culture. And so good cultures are often not regressed to the mean. They are differentiators. They have something that people strongly believe in a way. They strongly act that is different from every other company. And that's, again, Apple shows that it can certainly persist beyond a founder. Maybe you need a founder to get a going. I don't know.

    - **Note:** The founder imparts the culture but it’s vital to engrain a high agency culture deep in the organization. Steve Jobs with 10k lives. High quality and high agency culture. Friction in business is a massive drag on gdp as a whole. Friction can cause points of gdp to be lost. Software is hard because it’s not very legible sometimes what you want to do will take a week or a year and it’s not clear at the beginning. Most software engineers run at 20% because it’s so abstract hard to reason. The creates moats because even with 1bn you might not be able to create a better product. Power laws. Tacit knowledge is so vital in these creative areas more than anything. Important to care deeply about the details and treat the customer with sympathy and as an adult. Management by walking around but for customers. There are increasing returns to elegance and beauty banks are nice for a reason.
