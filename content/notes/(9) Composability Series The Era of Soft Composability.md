### Highlights

- Altogether, we’ve progressed somewhat like this:

    - **Note:** Moving from one time smart contract deployments to forming a DAO that creates a company around a token, so uniswap v1 can now be uniswap v2 under the uniswap name and protocol. Soft composability is using hooks and off chain proofs to create consensus and alignment by going up the trust stack again and relying on social trust. Trust the code trust the dao trust the social layer. protocols like Jokerace, Farcaster/Bountycaster, points, ZK proofs/ML, and Uniswap v4 hooks all create flexibility and efficiency by relying more on “trust” within the social layer.
