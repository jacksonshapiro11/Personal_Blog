  Five million dollar revenue companies and yeah there was a sense of adventure around the way that firm was built is a great book that one of Patrick's hodcast put me on to I think he was Speaking with Toby the Shopify founder and recommended a book called Infinite Games which is a great read and one of the concepts in there which is really interesting is this idea of Poesis and poema poesis is the creation process and poema is the creation the thing that you then look at and I think when you're looking at the industry it's very natural to just look At as the firms as they are today and there's a lot of narratives that get built around that and a lot of perceptions around oh that's what these firms are but what's really fascinating Is you go back to what was the process of creation what were actually the steps that got taken to build it and often the story it's not neat it's about perseverance and then eventually Connecting with opportunity and a lot of discipline and refinement of what those firms are doing and that's been my experience we do get this so gratifying sense of compounding that Initially it's very much the flywheel turns very slowly step by step and you do start to get a sense that investors investing in operating talent and importantly respected portfolio Companies start to regard you as a leader in your segment and there's huge opportunity that comes with that but I don't think you can jump to that I think it requires a lot of patience and Almost the more patient you are in getting there maybe the more durable it will be when you get there because I think you do hear about situations where businesses just get created a great Scale overnight but I tend to think that the hard patient road and it's not to say it's not a very enjoyable road a road of daily application and trying to recent yourself and make sure Each week is generative not depleteive and I think if you can find that cadence where you're accustomed to a lot of hard work and you've got the outlets where you can have your life in balance ([Time 1:00:02](https://share.snipd.com/snip/67d095f6-2e7a-42dc-a8ad-aec2b83be80c))
