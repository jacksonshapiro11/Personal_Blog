### Highlights

- 1. Question every requirement. Each should come with the name of the person who made it. Never accept that it came from a department. Then you should question it, no matter how smart that person is…even if that requirement came from me.
  2. Delete any part of the process you can…if you do not end up adding back at least 10% of them, then you didn’t delete enough.
  3. Simply and optimize..after step two.
  4. Accelerate cycle time. Every process should be sped up.
  5. Automate. That comes last.
- Comradery is dangerous, makes it hard for people to challenge each others work
  It’s OK to be wrong. Just don’t be confident and wrong.
  Never ask your troops to do something you wouldn’t do yourself.
  When hiring, look for the right attitude.
  A maniacal sense of urgency is our operating principle.
- The only rules are the ones dictated by the laws of physics. Everything else is a recommendation.
