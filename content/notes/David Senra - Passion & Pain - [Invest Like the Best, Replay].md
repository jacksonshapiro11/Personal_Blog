- Embrace Extremes, But Set Boundaries
  Summary:
  Pursuing exceptional experiences over a moderate approach involves a commitment to push personal boundaries and realize one's potential.
  Living in moderation may lead to unfulfilled potential, so it’s crucial to recognize one's obsessive tendencies. Instead of cramming work into a conventional five-day week, spreading tasks over seven days allows for a balanced lifestyle.
  This strategy enables the pursuit of passions while maintaining boundaries to prevent obsession from overwhelming one’s life.

  Speaker 1
  I've had this quote since 2017. I'm not a fan of moderation. I'm attracted to extremes. What do you want your life experience to be? Do you want to be exceptional? Do you want to push the boundaries of your capabilities? Do you want to walk around in a fog, butting up against your potential but never actually realizing it? Then knock yourself out. Be moderate. I'm not interested in that. So I can't do the podcast less than I do. All I can do is say, hey, this thing, this obsession of mine will overtake my life because I've seen enough stories where it can ruin my life. So I have boundaries. I have a balance every day. The only thing I figured out is because I'm an obsessive person, obviously, you are a ton of people are that are listening to this as well. So what I realized is like, okay, instead of working like ton of hours, five days a week, I'll just spread everything out and have a balance seven days a week.

- Embrace the Pain on the Path to Excellence
  Summary:
  Excellence in entrepreneurship is fundamentally about the ability to endure pain and face challenges head-on.
  Every individual harbors aspirations for significant achievements, yet the journey is riddled with difficulties that test emotional resolve. Successful figures like the founder of Four Seasons and James Dyson exemplify this struggle, revealing moments of despair and the will to persist despite setbacks.
  It's crucial to recognize that feeling unmotivated is a universal experience, but commitment to the cause must supersede personal feelings.
  A business is primarily about serving others, not fulfilling one's own comfort.
  The notion of expecting an easy path in entrepreneurship is misguided; embracing struggles is part of the ride. Entrepreneurs must accept the inherent unpredictability of their journey, akin to sailing through storms when aiming to reach their destination. The pursuit requires resilience, dedication, and the acceptance of hardship as an integral part of the process.

  We may not talk about the most important. And that's the best maxim in the history of entrepreneurship was said by the founder of Four Seasons that excellence is the capacity to take pain. Anybody trying to do something difficult, how many people want to do like a great achievement with their lives? Every single living person that has ever lived, no one's like, oh, I don't want to do anything. I'm here and I'll just die. No, they have ideas. They may never pursue. They may have the courage. They may attempt. They may fail. Think of it like the difficulty he had to do of trying to make knowledge as a hotel chain, but it's time the best hotel chain in the world and all the struggle that he had to get to in his autobiography, His wife would wake up in the middle of the night, see him like staring at the middle of the ceiling, just wracked with guilt. Anybody that's ever done anything difficult, whether it's a company, anything, knows the euphoria and terror. It's the entrepreneurial emotional roller coaster. And the reason that I think it's so important to talk about is because it is supposed to be hard. There's not a book that you're going to pick up where the guy's like, our woman, hey, I have this idea. I started it. Everything went great. And the end of the book, it doesn't happen. And so, what's fascinating to me is I never know what books are going to resonate with me either. What I really try to tell people is like, there were so many times I'm like, no one gives a shit about founders. This isn't going to work. I'm trying to grow a podcast that doesn't have interviews. I don't have social media. And I'm introverted as hell. And then you have to make a commitment like a podcast. It's like choosing a friend. I'm asking you to spend an hour, hour and a half with me. It's not like a 30 second TikTok, dude. This is a high bar here. And so many times it's like, man, I'll just give up. And a lot of what pushes me is these stories like, oh, okay, this is normal. When James Dyson says in his autobiography that there's many nights in his 14 years that he came in, he had two mortgages in his house, he spent the whole day trying to build a prototype, Blew up in his face. It didn't work. At the end of that book, the reason it's so important, it's against the odds and autobiography of James Dyson. It's hard to find, but if you can get a copy, order it. And he says, listen, it's easy for me to celebrate my doggedness now. I made $300 million a share, but I'd be lying to you if there wasn't times where I went inside my house, had my wife look at me in the face like I'm a failure and I'd cry myself to sleep. And I got up and did it again anyways, because excellence is the capacity to take pain. I apply this to like, I don't really feel like working out right now. I don't feel like doing cardio. I don't give a shit David, what do you feel? How you feel is irrelevant. That's an idea I got from Henry Ford. You read his autobiography. He goes, I feel sorry for these, I think he calls them soft and flabby men that can only do great work when they feel like it. That was one of the first episodes of Founders Ever Dead. There was like 200 people listening at that point. I read the quote, and I go, so essentially, Henry Ford is saying, fuck your feelings. That line for some reason resonated because I didn't know people were listening to this. And what Henry Ford's point was, listen, a business exists to serve other people. So how you feel, there's going to be days where you get out of bed and you cannot wait to get to work. And that's great. And there's going to be days where you don't want to go to work. And that is irrelevant because the business is not about you. The business does not exist for your pleasure. The business exists to serve other people. What's surprising to me is in Readwise app, I can segment books by author, when's the last time I read it? What's fascinating is I segmented it by what book has my highlighted the most? Who shocked what it was? It was the autobiography of Ed Catmull, Creativity Inc., which is the founder of Pixar. One thing that is in that book that I think is the perfect illustration of this idea, the excellence, the capacity to take pain, and that it is supposed to be hard. I just heard Stanley drunken Miller. He talked about it's the exact same phenomenon. I think he said he was working for George Soros. I don't know, I might have this wrong, which is kind of crazy. And he's like, lost a bunch of money. He just went away for a while. He's like, I can't do this anymore. I'm not good at it. I'm an idiot, completely depressed. He's like, I just got to go away. The difference between Stanley and a million other investors and entrepreneurs is like a million other people did that. They went away and they never came back. But he overcame. He's like, I'm in pain. I'm going to keep going forward. So there is a filmmaker that works for Pixar that put this beautifully. And he used the metaphor of doing anything difficult, but for your eye purposes of building a company. And he says, if you're sailing across the ocean, and your goal is to avoid weather and waves, then why the hell are you sailing? You have to embrace the sailing, means that you can't control the elements, and there's going to be good days, and there's going to be bad days. And whatever comes, you deal with it, because your goal is to eventually get to the other side, you will not be able to control exactly how you get across. That is the game you decided to be in, which is exactly what Henry Ford was telling us. Then don't run a company, dude. That is the game you've decided to be in. If your goal is to make it easier and simple, don't get in the fucking boat. ([Time 1:15:05](https://share.snipd.com/snip/88ae4c06-6c25-4e53-8edf-ae6fd666100d))
