  The book that I want to talk to you about today is the presentation, Secrets of Steve Jobs, How to be Insanely Great in Front of Any Audience, and is written by Carmine Gallo. So a friend of mine founded a company and he raised money from some of the best venture capital firms in the world. And he sent me this book because he says that they told him, his investors told him that he should read this book before his next round of fundraising. And apparently they give this advice to other founders in their portfolio as well. This book makes the case that Steve Jobs was the greatest business storyteller of our time. And so I think the ideas in this book are really important because essentially if you read the book, it tells you how to sell like Steve Jobs. And since business is sales, I want to dedicate an entire episode to going over some of his ideas because think about it. You're selling when you pitch an idea, you're selling when you talk to customers, you're selling when you're trying to recruit people to come work for you, you're selling when you try To raise money for your business. And I think when you study the life and career of Steve Jobs, it's very obvious that he believed all these things. It's why he spent so much time and effort learning how to sell. In fact, in this book, he said that he considered his keynote presentations competitive weapon and he considered a competitive weapon for Apple. There's a great quote in the book about why this is so important. And it says a person can have the greatest idea in the world. But if that person can't convince enough other people, it doesn't matter. And so what I did is I took the ideas in this book and I organized them in the way that the book recommends. So there's three things that I'm going to talk to you about today. One, what are you really selling? Two, how Steve Jobs made his presentations? And three, the importance of developing a messianic sense of purpose. And so I want to start with, what are you really selling? Because I really do believe this is the most important part of the entire book. So if you would ask Steve Jobs, he wouldn't say, Oh, like, what do you do for a living? Oh, I sell computers. No, he would say that he sells tools that unleash human potential tools that change the way that you work and that change the way that you play.

    - **Note:** What are you selling how you present that and what is your purpose. Start with the customer experience then work backwards to the technology. Uses simple but unusual words. Problem is current computers create slow crummy products Steve creates a simple fast product. Explain what you do with peoples money or your product in clear English. No jargon simple and direct language focus why customer should care about your product and what the product does for them. Sell the improvement your product makes. Figure what your selling through what you’re improving in others lives. You’re selling an improvement to others. Describe idea in one line then repeat it constantly. Mac book air words thinnest notebook continue to repeat we forget what we forget and forget constantly. Figure out what problem your solving then come up with a simple message to market it.

  So the second thing that I want to talk to you about is how Steve actually made his presentations. And the first thing he did was that he planned his presentations in analog. He would use pen and paper before opening keynote and using any kind of software. And he loved drawing out his thinking on the whiteboard. In fact, I was telling my friend Rick Gerson about this book as I was reading it. And something that pops up in this book popped up in the book from last week, which is called Insanely Simple. And then another book called Creative Selection, which is all about people that worked very close to Steve Jobs describing how he worked. And this idea that he would act as his own slideshow, that he would jump up from a conversation to the whiteboard appears over and over again. And so I was telling my friend Rick about this. And he's like, Oh, that's funny. That's that he did the exact same thing when I met him. And Rick told me, sorry, when he went to meet Steve Jobs, this is when Steve Jobs was running Pixar, they were thinking about making an investment in Pixar. And so the conversation quickly went to the whiteboard and then Steve just essentially built like this hub and spoke model. And he was talking about all the different businesses that you could launch off of a single movie, just like Disney did. So you have merchandise, you could do theme parks, you could branch into other forms of media. And the way Steve wanted to explain this point was to draw on the whiteboard. And so the way the book describes how Steve structured his presentations, is another three point list is a number one, create a list of points you want your audience to remember. ([Time 0:15:03](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ee387de8-3216-4f77-b1aa-9d3dcf5180a1))
    - **Note:** How Steve presented create a list of things you want your audience to remember distill that list to 3 points and under those 3 points use facts stories and social proof. Rule of 3 in communication. Art of storytelling money flows from story telling. Don’t put too much information in a presentation and start with the problem. Tell a story show a demo use a picture. Add context to how numbers. Use simple memorable words in presentations audience should be informed and entertained. He puts numbers in context asked why he was only 5% of the pc market he compared himself to bmw who was only 5% of the car market. Use simple fun words like jokes and insanely great products they’re more memorable talk colloquially. Social proof is vital. Steve also practiced a ton. Great presenters talk 90 hrs for 1 hr of presenting. A lot of effort goes into things appearing effortless.
- Effortless Presentation and Messianic Purpose
  Summary:
  Effortlessness in presentation requires meticulous effort and rehearsal, demonstrated by Steve Jobs who dedicated hours to refining every detail.
  Developing a messianic sense of purpose, like Jobs, entails being driven by a zeal to create new experiences for customers and passionately building tools to improve their lives through innovative technology.

  He was also, as we already know from all the books we've read and the podcast we've made on him, he was involved, of course, in every detail of the presentation. And that's exactly how he made it look effortless. It takes a lot of effort to make something look effortless. And there was very few speakers that would rehearse more than Steve Jobs would. In fact, there's a hilarious story in the book where he comes, he arrives four hours late to an interview one time because he was practicing his presentation. And in this book, they quote another book, which is called the Second Coming of Steve Jobs. I also have that book, but I haven't read it yet. And it says every slide was written like a piece of poetry. We spent hours on what most people would consider low level detail. Steve would labor over every presentation. Again, marketing is theater. So practice your presentations. And number three, develop a messianic sense of purpose. Steve was an evangelist. He was driven by this messianic zeal to create new experiences for his customers. He was clearly passionate about building tools for other people. Steve dedicated his life to building technology that made other people's lives better. The greatest definition of technology I've ever come across was actually in Peter Thiel's book, Sarah to one, where Peter says properly understood any new and better way of doing things Is technology. Steve truly believed with all of his soul that the products that he created was a new and better way of doing something for his customers.

    - **Note:** Tech is a new or better way of doing something Steve had a messianic sense of purpose. Steve said he was making tools for geniuses to change the world from when he was a kid Steve wanted to change the world. Passion is infectious. When Phil knight sold encyclopedias he couldn’t but he sold shoes easily because passion is infectious and belief is irresistible. Inject your passion into others. He was crying watching and Apple ad to think different because he loved Apple and believed so deeply in the mission.
