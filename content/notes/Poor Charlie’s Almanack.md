### Highlights

- Incentive caused bias and man with a hammer syndrome cause many issues we need a broad education. Need cross disciplinary connectedness in education we. Need many models. Learning more than just what we need but also keeping skills sharp seeing things further and backward. Seeing big ideas from different fields. 15 mins left. The best answer often comes out of a different field. Interconnectedness of knowledge. Latticework of models. Use critical approach and scientific method. Take fundamental ideas seriously.
    - **Tags:** #incentive-structures, #latticework-of-models, #critical-approach-(conjectures-and-refutations), #perspective-taking, #man-with-hammer
    - **Note:** Power of incentives in outcomes. Latticework of models get fundamental ideas of society. Man with hammer syndrome. Many models critical approach many perspectives
- Curiosity is vital. Reciprocal and social rules like lining up or letting someone pass you in traffic are vital to human. We do this because of kantian fairness tendency. Envy and jealousy tendency higher to those closer to you. Envy not greed drives the world. There is a taboo around saying people are envious. We believe strongly in reciprocity. We reciprocate anger and love. It’s important to defer reaction especially when negative. People want to reciprocate kindness so do small favors. Sam Walton said buyers couldn’t accept any gifts because of this issue. Concessions are important chaldini asked people to supervise a zoo trip got 1/6th yes then separated asked to work with those kids for 2 years got 100% no then swapped in the zoo and the acceptance rate was 1/2. Concessions and reciprocal. Influence by associate like Jordan shoes or raising prices to raise perceived quality advertise things with pretty and attractive people. Like going back to the casino after winning split luck from skill by analyzing past success. This don’t shoot the messenger syndrome. Welcome bad news to avoid this.

    - **Note:** Welcome bad news don’t ignore it. Envy drives the world and we envy those closer. Reciprocity and concessions are what keep relationships strong. Mimetic completion and models associate yourself with greatness and compete with neighbors.
      Defer anger sleep on the problem.
- Instead of working hard create a system for thinking and knowledge acquisition from the big models big disciplines. Synthesis over disparate ideas. Contrast based perception putting your hand in warm and cold water then putting them both together they don’t feel the same such is with contrast in judgement. Incentives are vital like the fedex fallacy incentives create outcomes. Incentives rule the world but don’t over optimize for one area balance is needed. Same as aresdotle is nichomachean ethics good people behave with the incentives. Dont blame people but the bad incentives. Design better systems to get better outcomes. Prompt rewards are important. We have people we like or love or dislike or hate who have a larger effect on us than the average person choose these people wisely. Man has a strong doubt avoidance tendency. We also hate change and inconsistency. We hate lack of clarity and change. We rarely change our minds. Avoid confirmation bias. People prefer to stick in their ways. Initiation ceremonies enhance commitment. We assume these roles then we become them over time because we assume the identity. Teaching something to others even if wrong makes us understand and believe it more. Modern education teaches bad politics who the students then push on us when they’re young and influenable then they’re a communist for life.

    - **Note:** Create a system of knowledge. Incentives influence the outcome more than anything. Synthesis of knowledge. People behave how they’re incentivized to. Perspective taking is important in life. Good system design and don’t over optimize. We’re the sum of our 5 closest friends. Humans avoid uncertainty and rarely change our minds. We assume roles and identities over time masks and identity bind us. Teaching things to others creates leverage orangutan theory.
- Know the big ideas from the big professions. You need to insource not outsource thinking and have a diverse group of mental models. Create a strong brand and get everywhere what’s great about Coke is that everyone needs to drink water is boring sugar is good and caffeine is nice to have which all point to soda being popular but to really develop it into a trillion dollar idea you need worldwide distribution through brand and constant shelf space. This leads to the Lolapoloza or power law victory as the biggest side player with 50% of the market. Market everywhere and create a Pavlovian effect of strong reinforcement from sugar that hacks the brain and great brand image. Hacking the flavor and create social proof and cultivate desire with a secret formula. Coke also outsources the capex bottling and focuses just on selling the syrup as wide as possible. Need cross disciplinary thinking that education doesn’t have psychology and other fields have no synthesis. Cultivate the critical approach.

    - **Note:** Big ideas from big profressions don't outsource thinking. Power of a brand . Power law effects and create hacks for brains and focus on cross disciplinary thinking and what makes your beer taste better.
- Ideology distorts cognition. Avoid dogma. Heavy ideology pounds bad ideas in without thinking. Envy drives the world. Get the main models use them as a checklist pay attention to lalapoloza and psychology is broken and incomplete. Captain cook modeled behavior before people followed him. He wanted people to eat sour kraut but there was a bias against German food so he first had the officers eat it then the men one day a week then every day and this cured scurvy by modeling this desire. Create good systems if it’s easy to cheat even good people will align incentives. You need to stop slop early don’t let it compound. Create a culture to embrace reality and resist dogma allow people to change their mind. Mistakes are part of life success = mistakes well handled need to know when to fold the cards. Constantly learning even in old age. You can’t know everything about everything if you don’t know just say it and don’t give an opinion. Appeal to interests. Use common sense as a macro filter on ideas to acid test them. First ask does this model even make sense. More cross disciplinary learning and less organizational dogma more synthesis and common sense less bs. Choose the life you want to live not one chose for you but you have the extreme agency to choose. Best of what others figured out.
- Benefits of scale in business don’t go to airlines but do go to cereals and by is that. Probably because branding trumps commodity and commands more value. Investing in commodities leads to long term death because and capex doesn’t go to you but the consumer so it’s just competition to the bottom but no projection uses this second level thinking. Ride the waves of technology and stick into your circle of competence. You can’t know everything about everything so you need to bet big when you see a clear advantage otherwise stay reasonably market is generally efficient. Investment management is confusing because incentives are backwards. Best businesses are incentive allignment fedex paid not by the hour but by the shift and problems went away. Bet on high quality businesses and concentrate. Holding for 30 years vs selling short term has a 2.5% compounded effect on returns. Find great business small or large and hold forever. Envy drives the world. Paramutual race track view of markets. Spend each day trying to get a little wiser than you woke up. Constant compounding live with humor have low expectations and surround yourself with love from others. Live with change.

    - **Note:** Branding is better than a capex competitive business like airlines that has no edge. Stick in your circle of competence bet big when you have an edge. Use second level thinking. Understand incentives compound for a long time. Investing and Mr market.
- Have a wide array of mental models that you see the world through. Be able to think probabilistically with permutations and combinations. Understand accounting. 5 ws who what where when and why. Give people all these when giving direction and the why is vital to informing people. People need justification. Psychology drives the world and bias is everywhere it’s important to see what’s happening at the surface and the biases influences the situation below it. Micro economics and scale economies economies ecosystems and business have advantages to scale. Scale allows specialization and creates social proof through distribution allows advantages to compound abs can create network effects. Narrow casting can be a big benefit especially with the internet and scale companies get destroyed by beuracracy. Balance between beuracracy and scale. Sam Walton started small then scaled.
- How to be unhappy take drugs or drink be envious resent others. Ben Disraeli gave up vengeance you should do that. Be reliable to others this is vital. Learn from others not experience. The best of what others figured out. Get up quickly failure is a given we’re defined by our response and quick reaction how many time we get back up not get knocked down. Invert problems and be constantly open minded even seeking out disconfirming evidence and testing that looking at that closely not looking away. Reliability is the most important quality

    - **Note:** Give up vengeance and envy. Be reliable and learn from others not experience. Failure is inevitable but we’re defined by our response. Get up quickly no matter how many times you get knocked down. Be open minded and seek disconfirming evidence.
- Multiple mental models approach to business and investment that looks at the asset and the wider ecosystem. Looks through economics psychology lenses ect to come to a justification. The world is interconnected and our thinking frameworks should be too. To get the sense of the system to reduce to the first principles. Created his own system of big ideas from the big disciplines. Very large and concentrated bets with high conviction long term holding. Need the right intelligence but also the right temperament. Reduces stupidity to make more time to think by avoiding bad things. Thinking widely using different models while staying within his circle of competence. Finding and assessing moats. Separates process from outcome. Looks at incentives sustainability and the system. Need to be non consensus and right and constantly working and learning. Ask why be intellectually humble and prepare don’t be falsely precise. Expose your surface area of luck embrace change and embrace reality. Keep focus don’t get lost in the sauce. Have a personal philosophy

    - **Note:** Multiple mental models approach to business which sees the asset within it's ecosystem and uses different connected frame works from other disciplines to assess competitive advantage. Reduce things to first principals and create the right system
      Temperament and betting big when you have an edge is vital avoid stupidity more than anything and understand incentives and moats
      Remain humble to the unknown world increase your focus and surface area for luck embrace change and reality and develop your personal philosophy that works for you.
- “Acquire worldly wisdom and adjust your behavior accordingly. If your next behavior gives you little temporary unpopularity with your peer group… then to hell with them”
    - **Tags:** #internal-locus-of-control, #learning-(global-vs-local)
- “His essays extol the virtues of free enterprise, yes, but also of doing business the right way, with integrity and rigor. Of taking your work very seriously, but never yourself.”
  “simple frameworks that produce more reliable analysis than complex financial statements”
  “ode to curiosity, generosity, and virtue”
  “thrift, duty, hard work, and simplicity”
    - **Tags:** #simplicity-(power-of), #integrity, #curiosity, #buffet/munger
- “based on fundamental human nature, basic truths, and core principles from a wide range of disciplines”
  understand the basics of human kind—how humans think, act, behave, react throughout history—and use that to shape what will happen again; all knowledge can be useful knowledge; change is inevitable but perhaps humans never really change at their core
    - **Tags:** #cross-disciplinary, #human-nature-remains-constant, #the-best-of-what-others-figured-out
    - **Note:** Develop a cross disciplinary understanding human nature which never changes
- “unconventional way of thinking and his extraordinary work ethic”
  - difference of thought allows new truths to be unlocked, a different way of thinking that others way have missed, but no amount of knowledge or intelligence can beat hard work; tenacity to learn and ability to digest as much information as quickly as possible
- the importance of curiosity
  question everything; a yes-man is the easy route but not the route to success
  “a person’s word was trusted implicitly”; “understood and respected the value of one’s word”
  - actions proven time and time again build a reputation for oneself; one’s word and reputation are the single most important thing possessed
  do the job right the first time; be responsible
    - **Note:** Have to evaluate and criticize everything to form own view; don't just follow the masses. But while you can't trust everyone's word, make a point to deliver on everything you say you will do to create implicit guarantee of delivery. Add value by being the go-to person for something specific, built through repetition and consistency. Take responsibility for yourself by working hard from the start, the rest will follow. Better to spend more time doing it right the first time then having to do it twice. Reputation starts from first impressions but is built over time through consistent performance.
- Much of Franklin’s success was due to the essential nature of the man— most especially his appetite for hard work, but also his insatiable curiosity and patient demeanor”
  “to identify potential “yes” candidates, Charlie looks for an easy-to-understand, dominant business franchise that can sustain itself an thrive in all market environments”
  don’t lose sight of the big picture via the maximization or minimization of one single factor so as to make that one factor overwhelmingly important
    - **Tags:** #simplicity-(power-of), #circle-of-competence, #hardworking, #curiosity, #ben-franklin, #systems-thinking
- long screen process; self-discipline
  his investing checklist: risk (avoid unnecessary risk and always be compensated for risk you do take on), independence (in thought and actions); preparation (lifelong self-learner through voracious reading, cultivate curiosity); intellectual humility (accept you don’t know things); analytic rigor; allocation (proper allocation of capital is investors number one job); patience; decisiveness and conviction (when the right circumstances present themselves); change; focus (simple, remember the end goal)
  - those who wish for instant wealth are destined to fail

    - **Note:** you have to get rich slow. Take calculated risks think independently be prepared remain humble act with conviction and focus
- multidisciplinary approach to thinking and learning; become better in a specialized discipline by knowing more about others
  “much Pavlovian conditioning, powerful social proof effects, and a wonderful-tasting energy-giving, stimulating, and desirably cold beverage that causes much operant conditioning”
  “the company that needs a new tool and hasn’t bought it is already paying for it”
    - **Tags:** #big-ideas-vs-getting-lost-in-complexity, #social-proof
- “uncommon common sense”
  - pilots must undergo regular and original training, constant checklist routines—just like pilots one should regularly be going back to the basics and checking in to see if they are hitting the basic targets; expand outward from there, take a step back to see what may be missing from the equation
  - digging deep into one topic has its merits—success comes from specialized training as well—but cannot remain in that deep state forever for so many of the simple ideas may be forgotten in the process
  “broad scale problems, by definition, cross many academic disciplines”
  “1) take a simple, basic idea and 2) take it very seriously”
    - **Tags:** #checks-and-balances, #first-principles-thinking, #simplicity-(power-of), #complex-adaptive-systems, #seriously-(taking-simple-ideas-seriously-can-lead-to-amazing-things), #cross-disciplinary
    - **Note:** Focus on the simple, basic things because often that is where the problems will arise from and where improvements can easily be made; important to the broader picture.
      Having a multi disciplinary understanding of the world creates better orientation for how the world actually works, every problem is complex but the drivers behind them are simple and basic.
      Power of simplicity start with first principles to serve complex problems with cross disciplinary answers.
- “1) take a simple, basic idea and 2) take it very seriously”
  “fatal connectedness, leading to man-with-a-hammer syndrome, often causing overweighing of what can be counted”
  “grab with full attribution and full discipline, using all knowledge plus extreme reductionism where feasible”
  over emphasis on macroeconomics; microeconomics can improve understanding of macro
  importance of synthesis of information
  the foundations of good businesses and good investing can be found in psychology
  too little attention to second and higher-order effects

    - **Note:** Take simple ideas seriously think bottoms up not top down and think about second order effects. Simplify things as much as possible without being too reductionist.
- go through life anticipating trouble so as not be caught surprised and unprepared
  generalized, evolution-based approach to thinking
  - humans are social beings, extremely susceptible to their environments, with most of their behaviors linked to a biological response—respecting authority, desire to be liked, creating hierarchies in society, their own groups, and themselves
  be less tricked by circumstance
    - **Tags:** #reherse-suboptimal-conditions, #emotions-cloud-judgement, #emotional-consistey, #accept-life-as-is, #evolution, #authority, #pity, #envy-runs-the-world
    - **Note:** Always being prepared for trouble so that when a problem arises it can be solved far more efficiently and effectively--no emotional response by being caught off guard, get right to work. There is always going to be both good and bad times, simply deal with what you are given and make the most of it. He believed that feeling sorry for yourself and envy were the two cardinal sins of evolution based mindset. Respecting authority and desire to be liked is not a bad thing, in fact it benefited Munger and Buffet several times, but it's about just being aware of it.
- “to be a great investor you need to fish where the fish are”
  - but know where all the fishing boats are—and take your road and reel elsewhere
  good incentive structures are so powerful—cognitive drift
  a tendency to ignore faults, favor people/product/etc., and distort facts to facilitate love
  loving admirable persons and ideas with a special intensity has a huge advantage in life and being a nice person can too
  hatred is part of our everyday lives, seen in war, politics, elections, etc.
  religion solves the question of puzzlement and stress (doubt) for many
  avoid quick decision making merely to avoid the uncomforted of doubt and nonconformity to own ideas and actions
  - constant reexamine your conclusions and attitudes, see if new evidence has arisen to prove what you currently believe wrong in any capacity
