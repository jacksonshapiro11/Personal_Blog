  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So I want to start with his father. He's going to have a rather tumultuous relationship with his dad. They actually are strange for quite a while, and I think Jimmy wasn't until Jimmy was in his 30s that he actually reconciled with his father. And I think you could trace Jimmy's desire to live an interesting life and to have a treat life like an adventure to his grandfather, because that's exactly what his grandfather did. Jimmy Buffett wasn't the first Buffett to set out for adventure. That would have been his grandfather, the former sea captain. His grandfather ran oil and ammunition to Europe during World War I. He had hustled oil to Japan for the standard oil company, and he had been a seal hunter in the Indian Ocean. His grandfather spent a lot of his life exploring the world by sea. Jimmy would do some of that later in life as well, and said life would loosen up when his grandfather was gone and tidy up when he returned. He was the moon controlling the tides. To his grandkids, he was the key to the universe. Everybody around Jimmy lived a conventional existence besides his grandfather, and his grandfather changes the course of his life, not only by his example, but in one of these conversations. So says on one day, the captain pulled out a nautical chart and led his grandson to the pier. Where are we, he said? Jimmy responded, Jimmy's a little kid with a sevening. We're on the crab pier. Look again, the captain said, pointing to the chart. Slowly, his point came into focus. ([Time 0:08:41](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4fabc4ef-fa84-4034-baa7-1425cf822432))
    - **Note:** Everyone in jimmys life lived conventionally except his grandpa who was a navy explorer and motivated him to be more than ordinary. The only thing standing between you and the world is a lack of imagination or over abundance of caution. All you need to do is leap and the world will be yours. His grandpa came from coal miners and jumped out a window to avoid the life of a miner. His dad wanted him to be conventional jimmy wanted to be a carrebian cowboy. Had an innate aura. He sets out in his early 20s performing on the street working for tips. Sees everything as a jumping off point and opportunity and this leads to his first gig. He went to New Orleans because a conventional existence was krytonite to him.

  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Bill Williams was the editor of Billboard's Nashville headquarters. And this is what he taught Buffett. He knew the town and the business that turned its gears. A hit song was nice. But owning the publishing on a hit song was even better. So they would hang out. They would drink at the end of the day. And Bill is just sitting there schooling a young Jimmy Buffett to the game. And so this is the first time in the book that this is mentioned, but it's mentioned over and over again. It's the fact that artists are disposable commodity. There's always another kid coming to town who can sing. You've got to handle the business end of the music business. You cannot think of yourself as just an artist, as just a musician. You will get taken advantage of. It talks about, you know, yeah, you have a hit song, but the guy that owned the publishing is making all the money. And Buffett is going to take these lessons and put them to use maybe better than almost any other musician in history. Like, there's been what hundreds, maybe tens of thousands of musicians. How many of them are billionaires? How many of them build businesses bigger than their music? You're talking what? 10, 15, 20. The number is less than 20. And Buffett is one of them. And when I'm reading this part, this part reminded me, I did an episode on Jay Z's autobiography, which is absolutely excellent. The book is absolutely excellent. It's episode 238 if you haven't listened to it. But there's a time where Jay Z's in his early 20s. This is reminding me of the lesson that Buffett, that Jimmy Buffett's getting his early 20s. Jay Z's in his early 20s when he reads this book called The Hitman. And The Hitman is essentially a history of the music industry about how artists get taken advantage of by executives and the people that actually control and own all the valuable assets. And so Jay Z in his 20s is just like Jimmy Buffett in his 20s was like, okay, I'm going to learn this and I'm going to make sure that doesn't happen to me. And the interesting thing is if you fast forward 30 or 40 years into both of their careers, they both apply these lessons to the point where they both built multiple billion dollar fortunes. Where their stories depart is Jay Z's first album was a success. Reasonable doubt is still considered a classic to this day. Jimmy Buffett had, you know, a decade and a half, two decades of struggle. So he's in Nashville. He gets his first record deal. He's putting out songs. He's putting out music. Nobody is knocking on the door. Nashville is not interested in Jimmy Buffett's sound. And so you'll see a bunch of sentences spread out through the book describing this time in his life. And I'll say something like the album didn't do anything. Nothing happened. He was completely stiffed. Jimmy Buffett got turned down by every single label. And the bad times were not just in his career. He got married young. It was a very hard time. They were young. It was very hard on them because they had no money and nothing was going well. And so he winds up at the same time he's failing professionally, right? He winds up getting divorced. And so it's just year after year of struggle and rejection. So he's like, all right, I got to get out of here. He said he hated Nashville. He's like, I need a change of place. I think I need a change of place. And so he goes, where can I go? He goes to the furthest place he can think of and he goes to Key West. And so there's two things that came to my mind when I was reading this part of the story. The first thing that came to my mind was that excellent, excellent quote by Steve Jobs. He says, you cannot connect the dots looking forward. You can only connect them looking backwards in life. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something. And the thing that Jimmy is trusting in is himself, his instincts, his intuition. He does not yet know this is going to be the most important decision he ever makes because he's the first person that is able to actually package up and sell this Key West lifestyle. The second thing that came to mind is this maximum that has been on my mind a lot and that is obvious in hindsight. Now that I've read 330 or however many books I'm on, when it comes to life of an entrepreneur, your experience is likely to be very similar to Jimmy Buffett's experience up until this Point, where everybody's saying, Jimmy, we don't like what you're doing. There's no market for that. We're not going to sign you. We're not going to help you in any way. And so the maximum is, is that you should believe that your opinion on what you're working on, right? Your opinion is greater than the opinion of everybody else around you. Jimmy Buffett believed in himself and his music. And I'm going to use a parallel that keeps hopping on my mind as well. Jay Z did too. Everybody else would not sign Jay Z. He went to other record labels. They wouldn't sign them. ([Time 0:16:19](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b49d687b-e7fb-4533-a420-4b6817610258))
    - **Note:** Buffet started small stuck to his sound and compounded his advantage he also understood the game on the field well. He worked at billboard because he needed money where he met top music executives young artists and got schooled in the understanding that to get rich in the music industry you needed to own your distribution. This is how he got rich. Jimmy thought Nashville was his ticket to music fame but no one liked his sound so he moved as far away as he could key west. You can’t connect the dots looking forward but this was a key decision in his life. At this point his music is getting rejected he has a failing marriage his life is struggling. No one will sign him because no one understands his sound. Your opinion on what you’re working on is greater than everyone else’s. Don’t compromise on your vision only you truly understand it.
- Key West's Wild Party Lifestyle and Jimmy Buffett's Role
  Key takeaways:
  - The party lifestyle in Key West during the described time period included prominent individuals and illegal activities.
  - Jimmy Buffett capitalized on the wild culture of Key West and marketed a more moderate version of it.
  - Key West at the time was known for heavy drinking, drug use, and a carefree attitude.
  - The isolation of Key West contributed to Jimmy Buffett's success as a musician.

  Speaker 1
  The mayor was there. The police chief was there. The fire chief, the city attorney, and the state attorney, you could get arrested, bonded, tried, and get a building permit all in the bar. This is the beginning of this party lifestyle that Jimmy packages up and sells. He sells like a more moderate version of this. I mean, there's insane stories about this, like this guy is walking around the bar. He has an aspirin bottle. He took out all the pills and filled it up with cocaine and put a straw in it. There's a line later on describing all the citizens of Key West at the time. They said they were dedicated to two pursuits, inebriation and fornication. There's a story in the book where somebody spikes all the alcohol with LSD. So everybody's drunk and then tripping on acid. And so at the end of the night, one of Jimmy Buffett's friends goes out to the sheriff's car and the sheriff hands the keys to Jimmy's friend and says, Hey, you have to drive. He's like, why am I? We're both like drunk and high on acid. Why am I driving? He's like, well, because I can get you out of trouble, but you can't get me out of trouble. Now, to the end of the story, there's a great line. It says, if you want to know what Key West was like back then, there you go. And so Key West at this time is the opposite of Nashville. It's isolated. It's cut off. It's the last place on earth you're going to move to if you want to make it as a southern or maybe country musician. But it's because of the decision and in part because of the isolation that makes Jimmy so valuable. Jimmy understood at a very young age that you should not try to be the best. ([Time 0:21:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6d13c313-7993-4f69-8c93-bd52c3a65cde))
    - **Note:** Don’t be the best be the only. He went to key west which was a different place than it is now. The entire city was run out of one bar that jimmy played at for tips and booze lived on the beach for $150 a month. One night someone spiked the booze with acid and the sherif made someone else drive his car back because he couldn’t get himself out of trouble but could get the other guy. This was a misfit backwater that jimmy exported to the world. He made his own genre. He kept his costs low and just wanted to practice and perform. Because he had few expenses he just focused on hitting the road and performing when he was free. He needed to perform. To practice his craft. He’s running his business out of the bar he’s playing in. He constantly works. He couldn’t get on the radio and executives didn’t like signing him because you couldn’t project him. He wasn’t categorizable but because a category. He couldn’t get radio play but has a great concert following beginning of a movement. Like Bob Dylan who had no category adequate singer great performer world class entrepreneur
- Bob Dylan's Unique Sound and Perspective on the Music Scene
  Key takeaways:
  - Bob Dylan saw himself as unique and didn't compare himself to others in the music scene
  - Jimmy Buffett had to create his own path because he didn't fit within the industry system
  - James Dyson faced rejection when trying to sell his cyclonic vacuum to a company that made vacuum bags
  - Jimmy Buffett persisted and believed in his work, playing his songs for anyone who would listen
  - He remained true to his own style and lyrics, even when others wanted him to change
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And he was talking about the people were asking him because his sound was just so different and so odd. And so it says, he was asked, like, who do you see yourself like in today's music scene? And this is what Bob Dylan said before he was famous, before he was successful. I told him nobody. I really didn't see myself like anybody. Well, really set me apart in those days was my repertoire. It was more formidable than the rest of the players. There were a lot better, better musicians around, but there wasn't anybody close in nature to what I was doing. Don't try to be the best, try to be the only in that documentary. Jimmy is very self-aware. He says, listen, I'm an adequate musician and I'm a fair singer, but he's a great performer and a world class entrepreneur. And those kinds of people cannot work within a system. They have to create their own. Here's a great line on why Nashville was not right for Jimmy Buffett and why every time he went there, he got rejected. No one's ever eager to fix a cash machine that isn't broken. Go back to episode 300 James Dyson. Still my favorite book against the odds and autobiography by James Dyson is still my favorite book out of every single book that I have ever read for this podcast. What was James's mistake? Oh, great. James, you invented the world's first cyclonic vacuum. Who did you try to sell to? You tried to sell to a company that made $500 million a year selling vacuum bags. You eliminated the bags. Of course, they're not going to buy it because no one's ever eager to fix a cash machine that isn't broken. And so James, just like Jimmy, had to find their own way in and the way you find your own way in is you do it yourself. This metaphor about to reach you, this metaphor is a is the way to think about Jimmy and his approach to his career. It is written about a poet and a painter named Kenneth Pachin. I am going to read it to you taking out Kenneth's words or Kenneth's name and putting in Jimmy's and it's perfect. It fits perfectly. So this is my version of the story that I think will illustrate the point I'm trying to make to you. Buffett was accomplished, if not exactly appreciated. Many critics found Buffett naive and romantic. Even the most generous praise was usually grudgingly as if Buffett had somehow won his place through sheer wrongheaded persistence. Sure of who he was and what he was doing, he kept at the job of being Jimmy Buffett until people came around or didn't. He didn't worry about it. And so what is Jimmy's response to being told no by the industry, being told no, you're not categorizable. We're not putting any marketing dollars around you. We're not putting on the radio. Well, his response to this sounds a lot like if you listen to the episode 3 14, Paul Graham, how to do great work. I love this. Paul Graham says something that grows exponentially can become so valuable that it is worth making an extraordinary effort to get it started. The Jimmy Buffett version of that idea sounds like this. He made up his songs when nobody was looking and played them from anyone who would listen in coffee shops, student unions, and listening rooms. And so even when he was a young man, he had this relentless self belief in himself and his work. And he was trying to make a product that only Jimmy Buffett could make. And so he releases this album. And so he has a song in there called Why Don't We Get Drunk. This is his first what we would call like a hit, like a middling hit. But at this time, it was the biggest song they ever had. And what was fascinating is people around him were trying to change the lyrics of the song. Because why don't we get drunk? If you leave it there, that's going to, that'll play on country radio. Nashville will play that. But he adds in the lyrics, it's Why Don't We Get Drunk and Screw. Remember, Jimmy is living in Key West. They are dedicated to the twin gods of inebriation and fornication. And so he's writing his lyrics about how he's living his life at this time. And so people around him will say, Hey, you got to take those words out of there. ([Time 0:28:05](https://share.snipd.com/snip/05528321-86d7-4699-8046-53155b7db5f7))
    - **Note:** Nashville wasn’t right for him because they didn’t want to fix a cash machine that wasn’t broken he needed to build his own world. He stuck to himself always being himself never giving in to the Nashville sound. People want to make you ordinary but keep your unique differentiation. He didn’t compromise who he was. Anything that rises above without some giant hype cycle is a success his first successful album was a record only he could make. When he was on stage he would talk to the audience for 10 minutes in between song barstool philosopher and drunk friend more than just music. People were there to here him talk and sing. Blue collar work ethic learning machine and won’t quit. He was a popular jukebox song but never saw a dime because those were owned by the mob. Own the distribution. He performed at noon on Monday for free at a Purdue students center because he loved the craft.

  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And so this article is several years old, but it says over the past four years, the rock band Fish has generated over $120 million in ticket sales. They are one of the most lucrative touring acts in America and have generated well over a quarter billion dollars. Yet by other measures, the band isn't popular at all. Only one of their original albums has ever made the Billboard Top 10 rankings. None of their 883 songs has ever become a popular hit on the radio. Are you starting to see the parallel? If the traditional band business model is to generate hype through media and radio airplay, and then monetize that hype through album sales and tours, Fish doesn't fit that model at All. Their album sales are minuscule and their radio airplay is non-existent. That is exactly the same for Jimmy Buffett. Fish doesn't make money by selling music. They make money by selling live music. And that, it turns out, is a much more durable business model. This wasn't some brilliant pre-calculated strategy by the band or its managers. It's the business model that sprung forth from the kind of music the band makes. The band developed the kernel of this musical style during their first five years when they played almost exclusively in bars. Slowly and organically, they grew their audience the same for Buffett. Another thing that's the same as Buffett is this sentence. During this period, they maniacally focused on improving the quality of their music through intense practice and frequent gigs. At first, these gigs were relatively unsuccessful. Over time, their audience grew. They were profitable before anyone in the music industry knew who the hell they were. We haven't even got to that part of the story, but that's exactly what's going to happen above its career too. And with profitability came the freedom to make music on their terms. Jimmy made music on his terms. He lived life on his terms and he built businesses on his terms. And so let's go back to his fierce work ethic. One of my favorite lines from as I mentioned earlier by Paul Graham on how to do great work is being prolific is underrated. Jimmy Buffett was definitely prolific. In a little more than a year and a half, Jimmy Buffett had recorded. I'm just going to count them. One, two, three, three full albums and then a soundtrack for a movie. He played every coffee house, beer joint and student assembly room from Boston to the keys to San Francisco and back. He continued to work Nashville, whether Nashville liked it or not. He could make a living in Texas. He had a beat up truck, a nice little boat and a minor hit. He'd grown his one man band into two. He had his wit and his charm and went right back to work. And so in addition to being a workaholic at this point in his career, he's also a control freak. Jimmy did everything. Buffett didn't think that the art department could present his music better than he could. He didn't think that someone else should write the line notes on his album. He had a case file full of evidence that record companies didn't get him and couldn't figure him out. Listen to what he says. So he's reflecting on this time of his life. He's saying this in 2015. He says at that point in his life in his career, there was nobody out there but you. And so multiple decades later, he's defending himself. He says against charges of narcissism. Yes, I'm a confirmed narcissist because there was nobody back there who gave a shit at the time. You were on your own and you better be good. He was the most take control artist that have ever been around. And so when I got to this section, I've said this before, but if I had to distill every single thing down to one sentence, right? What have I learned so far in the seven years, 300 and something books, all these episodes about the kind of mentality that these founders had. And I would say you need to combine the work ethic of Kobe Bryant with the self belief of Kanye West. Jimmy Buffett had an intense work ethic, but just as important was his relentless self belief. And I think this point is so important to internalize this self belief access fuel. Everybody around them at this point saying, Jimmy, don't do what you're trying to do. Jimmy, don't chase your dream. What's wrong with you? No, we won't sign you. No, we won't play you on the radio. And Jimmy saying that belief was my fuel, what you call narcissism. I needed because there was nobody back then who gave a shit at the time. You were on your own and you had better be good. And so the reason I point this out is because this is happening to Jimmy in the 60s and 70s. It happened way before that. It happened to Henry Ford in the 19th and it will happen to people today. One of my favorite lines or one of my favorite songs about this is actually by Kanye. This is why he popped in my mind. And on his first album, he has a song called last call. It's 12 minutes long and it tells the story of him trying to achieve the dream that he had just successfully achieved with the completion of his first album. The parallels between Kanye's own story and Jimmy is spooky. Listen to what he says. Some say he's arrogant. He's talking about himself, okay? Some say he's arrogant. Can y'all blame him? It was straight embarrassing how y'all played him. Last year's shop in my demo, I was trying to shine. Every motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhyme. I'm going to pause there. Some say he's arrogant. They're saying the exact same thing about Jimmy, right? It was embarrassing how you guys treated me. Jimmy was embarrassed over and over again by record executives, by radio people, by everybody in Nashville. Kanye was shopping his demo, meaning his demo tape. Jimmy was trying to play his songs. They were both after the same thing. And everybody around them, they use different language, obviously, but everybody around them saying, Nope, you're not good enough. But here is the difference. And this is what Jimmy Buffett, Kanye West and all these entrepreneurs that you and I talk about have in common. They have this relentless self belief. Belief comes before ability. Now, I could let these dream killers kill myself esteem or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams. I use it as my gas. So they say that I'm gassed, but without it, I'd be last. So I ought to laugh. He continues, I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more. That's Kanye. What is Jimmy saying? I'm not listening to you. You don't get to define what I work on. You don't get to define if I succeed or not. And you could tell Jimmy believe that through his actions because everybody's telling him, no, and what do you do? The guy refuses to stop. Oh, you want to sign me cool? I'll go play this free gig in a student union at Purdue at 12 o'clock on a Monday. And the similarities between Kanye and Jimmy Buffett continue. So I don't listen to the people to the suits behind the desk anymore, right? You can't say shit to ... ([Time 0:36:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7e8f2527-a481-4cc7-8f73-aa93ed255aa7))
    - **Note:** Buffet is like fish they were selling a live music experience most people only heard jimmy if they had gone to a concert or bought a record because he wasn’t on the radio his music spread by word of mouth. Fish likewise never had a hit song but refined their act over time and practices to cultivate the perfect live act making hundreds of millions a year. He was extremely prolific putting out albums constantly and playing everywhere he needed to do his own marketing because no one understood him. Work ethic of Kobe and self belief of Kanye. No one believed in him they wanted to change him but he believed in himself. Belief before achievement. Obsessed with cost efficiency and had customers that loved him. He had a massive fan base but Nashville didn’t see him that way so he just built his own world.
- The Smart Business Approach of a Music Icon
  Key takeaways:
  - His record label was not spending much money on promoting him, but he still turned a profit.
  - Music was his first product, and live music was particularly successful for him, earning over $800 million from tours.
  - He was known as a benevolent dictator, being detail-oriented and in charge.
  - He prioritized the 90 minutes on stage each night above all else, believing that if they took care of that, they would achieve everything else they wanted in life.
  - By watching costs and staying committed to his craft, Buffett was able to make a small profit that gave him an infinite runway.
  - Buffett's success can be attributed to stumbling onto a successful business model and staying in the game long enough to get lucky.

  And because that his costs remain manageable, and he didn't have to sell that many records to make money, and his record label was not spending much money on promoting him that he was Actually turning a profit. In other words, he was building a successful business. Music would just happen to you to be the first product, the first of maybe hundreds. We talk about, I've tried to collect all the different things that he produced under the Margarita brand and all the licenses, Margarita Ville brand and the licenses. Yeah, like I can't even, you can't even find them all in one place. It's incredible. But music, more specifically live music was the first product. And when you hear this description of this live show, right, his first product, I think they said he made over his career, I think the number I pulled from like 2021, he had made over $800 Million from his tour. This is the beginning of it. So see pretty much stayed on the road, jamming more hours and miles into each day than the laws of time and space would seem to allow. He had proven himself capable of writing and recording music, putting together a band and keeping that band on the road and getting it on stage each night, no matter what, everybody Working for him and everybody around him calls him the benevolent dictator. That is the name that he gave himself. And that's how he approached his business. He liked being in charge and he liked being detail oriented. He is a benevolent dictator. That's what he calls himself. And you can tell right from the jump that he's smart. He keeps the main thing, the main thing. This is so smart. The ground rules as he explained to everybody around him was simple. I don't give a shit. What happens 22 and a half hours of the day, the only thing that matters is the 90 minutes that we're on stage. If you had a shitty day or if you're just dragging ass, I don't want to hear about it. Don't complain. What matters is the 90 minutes on stage, the main kept the main thing, the main thing. If we take care of this 90 minutes every night they're on stage and we do that for a long time, we'll get every single other thing that we want out of life. The 90 minutes on stage every night is what made Jimmy Buffett tick. And so it's because he stumbled onto this business model. It's because he watches costs. It's because he was maniacal while practicing and making his life so better and making a profit, even though it was a small profit, right? But that profit gave him an infinite runway. And what that achieved is another maxim from the history of entrepreneurship. Stay in the game long enough to get lucky. He is about to do that.
