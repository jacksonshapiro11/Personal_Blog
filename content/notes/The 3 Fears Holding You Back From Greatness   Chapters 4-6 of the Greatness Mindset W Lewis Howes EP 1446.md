  Of saying the wrong thing and being embarrassed while people laughed at me. I thought I would start stuttering and fall all over my words if I didn't fall on the stairs on the way to the stage. A few hours before one of my big events, I told one of my coaches, Chris Lee, about my fears. He challenged me to flip the script running in my head by pointing out that my fears were all about me. How I might look, how I might feel, how I might make a mistake. What if I made it all about serving other people? Why was I speaking in the first place? For me or for the audience? That shift in thinking about service began the wheels turning. He followed it up by asking questions and what I call the then what exercise. What if I forget what I'm going to say next? Okay, then what? Well, I'd be embarrassed. Okay, then what? I might run off the stage. Okay, well then what? Then everyone would laugh? Okay, then what? I'd probably not leave home for a week. Okay, well then what? I'd probably eventually pick myself back up and keep moving forward. I realized what Chris was getting at with this exercise. Even in the worst case scenario, I'd eventually be okay. And like Spanx founder Sarah Blakely mentioned, I'd have a funny story to tell. So why not just skip all the anxiety in the middle and start with everything will be okay in the first place? After that awakening, everything changed for me. I realized the power of what Sukhinder Singh Cassidy, president of StubHub calls the choice after the choice. And I knew that if my focus was on serving other people, then all my fears about what might happen to me became relevant. What can failure teach you? There are two general types of fear. The first type is a healthy fear of something dangerous. There are some things we should fear, things that will in fact harm us. That is when our fight or flight instinct comes in handy to protect us from harm. But the second type consists of wounded fears that hold us back emotionally, spiritually, mentally and physically, from making decisions that will make our future greater. These fears keep us living in the past. They are psychological fears as opposed to being driven by real life danger. Our fear of failure usually falls into this psychological fear category rather than the threat of real life danger. Even though it sometimes feels like it, the world probably won't end if you fail at most things in life. Some notable exceptions might include skydiving, atomic fusion, landing on Mars, but I digress. Remember, there is something worse than failing. The regret of not trying. On the other hand, failure can help us learn and grow. You might fail and may even receive criticism, but if you take that failure as an opportunity to learn what didn't work, you'll create something better, maybe even great the next time. For example, after his wildly popular book, The 48 Laws of Power, Robert Green worked on another book he just knew would be a breakthrough success. He labored over the manuscript for a year, but when he submitted the manuscript to the publisher, they dropped the project. Robert was stunned. The feedback he received was that his audience wanted to hear more of his thoughts, but he collaborated with rapper 50 Cent and made the book more about his collaborator than his own perspectives.

    - **Note:** Even if you fail eventually you’ll get right back up and do it again so you might as well just embrace failure because it won’t kill you and you will get over it so you shouldn’t be anxious. Two types of fear genuine fear of things like lions that could hurt us then there are psychological fears that paralyze us and bound our decisions when they’re really not material there is no real life danger we just feel there is. Most things are not worth fearing. The regret of not trying can be worse than failing and we can grow through failure. Take failure as opportunity to learn.
