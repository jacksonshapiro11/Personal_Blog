### Highlights

- He was faced with seemingly insurmountable challenges and overcame them. He remained positive in his disposition always. Had little formal schooling but read books his entire life to learn. He had an incredibly difficult life but realized he had as much time as anyone else so he could do anything. He runs away to soul and his dad tells him he needs to come back to take care of his family. He’s just a poor farm boy with no education he believes but his dad doesn’t and he’s scared he’ll fail and let the entire family down it’s a reasonable fear. He was incredibly poor he had to come home to poop so his family would have fertilizer. He runs away from home 4x because he can’t stand being a farm boy.

  Now back to a direct quote from Chong. I was born with the ability to accentuate the positive rather than the negative. Since I was 10 years old, I worked with my father under the scorching sun. His father was a very poor farmer. I worked all day, ([Time 0:08:23](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ac9ec2c8-ba0f-4b1d-a40f-8f91ab4a54cb))

  Do it until nothing more can be done. Give it your all until the very end. This thought is the very essence of me as a person and the fundamental principle of my life. The important part here too is he's applying this as, at simple tasks, to be a rice delivery boy. And yet he does that same fundamental principle. He applies when he's running a giant Fortune 500 multinational corporation. ([Time 0:22:25](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b72e3ed8-6bb2-4a1c-b469-125dcb544986))
- **Bedbug Analogy**
  - To illustrate the importance of persistence, Chung Ju-yung shares a story about bedbugs that climbed walls and dropped from the ceiling to bite people sleeping on tables.
  - He uses this as motivation, stating, "If these bedbugs can do it, why can't we men do it?"

  I want to just describe to you, now he's back, and his living conditions. And the reason I want to point this out is because this is right before he starts Hyundai. I was officially unemployed for the first and only time in my life. At that time, my family of 20 lived in a small 700 square foot house. So that's the conditions he's enduring before he starts Hyundai. Before I get into the birth of Hyundai, he's got this fantastic story in here. It's about what you can learn from bedbugs. So I want to take a short tangent because I love the story and then we'll get into Hyundai. Whenever I tell people that it was bedbugs that taught me nothing is impossible if one puts in one's best effort they think i'm exaggerating but this is the truth so to make ends meet he's Taking any jobs you can imagine taking any job he can possibly get and it's all manual labor he's back to where he started so it says the bunkhouse where i slept as a laborer was teeming With so many bedbugs that it was almost impossible to fall asleep. Some of the other workers tried to think of ways to avoid the bedbugs. But even when they slept on top of dining tables, they were still bitten as the parasites could climb up the legs of the tables. We put our heads together and came up with an idea of placing a steel pot filled with water under each of the four legs of the table. It worked. Unfortunately, uninterrupted sleep lasted only two days. Then things went back to normal the way they had been before. The bedbugs were biting us again. We wondered how could this be possible considering the bedbugs would fall into the pot of water if they attempted to climb up any of the legs. One night we decided to stay up to see how on earth they survived the water and managed to bite us. We were completely dumbstruck by what we saw when the lights were turned on. The bed bugs were climbing the walls and dropping from the ceiling onto our bodies. To this day, I cannot forget the shiver down my spine that I felt back then. This made me stop in my tracks and think. Even bedbugs think long and hard and use every bit of energy they have to achieve their goal, and ultimately they succeed. I'm no bedbug, I'm a man. These bedbugs can surely teach a man a few lessons. If these bedbugs can do it, why can't we men do it? We just need to stick to it and not quit. We need to emulate bedbugs. Okay, so we're going to get into the birth of Hyundai, which starts out first with the Hyundai Auto Service Center and then Hyundai Construction.

- Make full use of your time by living diligently. You can achieve more in a finite time than you can imagine don’t waste time. This dude has it rough sees money in construction and gets into it despite knowing nothing. He never knew anything but believed in his ability to learn. Another war destroys his company but he stays steadfast works with the us military this eventually becomes Hyundai. He was a tough boss very driven person. He sets incredibly high standards. He expands abroad because Korea is bad they lose money initially on the expansion because they know nothing and underprice their bids but the knowledge they gain fires them to success he remains very optimistic. He is just building has a ton of confidence. He only had one speed go. He creates a partnership with ford but realizes that he needs to make control. They start building domestic cars built for Korea not the us terrain he thinks his first car is very ugly but it sells very well so he can’t complain. True knowledge is only uncovered through hard work and innovation. He makes big mistakes constantly but acknowledges them and works to get better. Constantly learning.

  I think there's nothing more foolish than living a life according to the mantra of doing enough to get by. Not knowing how precious one's time is. In one lifetime, we can become a revered, immortalized politician, a scholar, a revolutionary, a writer, a musician, a painter, or a businessman like those we admire. ([Time 0:36:38](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4f3ccd7f-adfc-41f3-bb3d-b4e082dc1ed3))
- Determination over Intelligence. He decides to build a shipyard despite never doing anything like that and he goes to Japan and the us and can’t get the materials. He goes to the president of South Korea who motivates him and says he must be successful this leads to him becoming even more relentless and eventually successful. Sometimes you need people to push you when you give up support from others vital in tough circumstances. Philosophy find something you love to do and do it forever time is precious. Believe you can do things when encountered with something new and difficult start with a belief in your agency. Don’t covet luxury. He always sees himself as a worker. After luxury comes corruption. He has a distaste for waste.

  So when I got to this part in the book, this made me think of an idea. There's a podcast I listened to one time with Paul Graham, and he said something in that podcast that I've never forgot. It's about what is more important to succeed in life, intelligence or determination. Okay. Because we just got done, ([Time 0:52:14](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ee3aecd0-4c26-458c-8344-ff23f7b72f78))

  * Those who live with an open heart and positive mindset in the present live good lives outside of any external circumstances.

  These are special people, very special people. The businesses that they created are still around over a hundred years later. There is a lot we can learn from them. But what's interesting is the people in the company, and a lot of times the people in the company today and running the company today, they are not even learning the lessons from the people That started the company that they work at. That's bizarre to me. There's a ton of information and knowledge that if we keep applying and don't forget. And there's something in human nature. You know, last week when we were talking about Sam Bronfman, you know, he was hell-bent on building a dynasty. When he was talking to his family and his company he kept referring to that old axiom or maximum shirt sleeves to shirt sleeves and three generations not this family is what he would say Over and over again he talks about you know you have somebody who's extremely poor they in one generation they build their these generational election points they change the course Of their family and their company the second generation builds onto it like his sons did. And the third generation spends and wastes it away. And that's that cycle of life that we see over and over again. The reason that there's a maxim for it is because obviously there's something in our nature that that's going to occur over and over again. And by going back to the fundamentals, going back to the founders of these companies, why is this podcast called founders and not CEOs? Because founders are special people. They build things from nothing, from scratch. I just really like his idea here. You know, I've never come across a company that thrives under a luxury-loving, wasteful owner. But you've come across tons of companies that have been ruined by luxury-loving, wasteful management. So to that degree, his next point to us, be diligent. Now here he says, there are those who live their entire lives without doing one-tenth or one-one of the amount of work they are capable of. I found that those who complain of being tired and bored are the lazy ones. I strongly believe that people must work to live a full life. If you are diligent for a day, you will sleep comfortably for a night. You are diligent for a month, the quality of your life will noticeably improve. If you are diligent for two years, ten years, your whole life, your accomplishments will be recognized by all. The diligent lead lives a hundred times more productive than the lazy. Their lives are thus more fulfilling. Unless your life goal is wasting time, then the first thing I recommend is to be diligent. Being diligent forces you to move a lot, to think a lot, and to work a lot. Diligence mirrors your sincerity about living a full life. I don't trust anyone who is lazy. And this next section is that positive of thinking is the never once did I complain or slack off. When I went to the market to sell wood, it was difficult to take my eyes off of the rice cakes, noodles, and other delicious treats. I still remember how my shrunken belly growled with pangs of hunger. Moving to the city was not an easy decision. After all, I didn't have a proper education. I didn't have any friends or anyone to rely on. I had to do hard labor. But despite all of this, I never once regretted leaving home and never complained. If you inherit good health from your parents and learn the value of diligence and hard work, nothing can stop you. Tomorrow will be better than today, and the day after tomorrow will be even better. Knowing this, I've always been happy and full of life. Throughout my 80 years, there have been hard times of frustration and harder times of humiliation and defeat, when all I could do was clench my teeth and bear it. But if we set those times aside, I believe 90% of my life has been full of joy and meaning. I have truly lived well. What does it mean to say someone lives well? What circumstances a person was born into, what position he is in, what he does for a living does not matter. Only when he gives his best and lives fully in the present is a man truly happy. A man who lives fully in the present while dreaming of a brighter future, a man who enjoys his work and who finds happiness in the smallest of things, that man will find success in whatever He does. Such a man is one who lives well, whether a mid-level or highly skilled engineer, a Chinese food delivery boy, a student, or an executive. It's the same. Those who live with an open heart and positive mind are respected by society and play an important role. On the other hand, there are people born with healthy bodies, but who live useless lives because their perspective towards life is negative. Everyone has the ability to solve his or her own problems. But to do this, positive thinking is critical. We should always remember that every major achievement was led by people with positive attitudes. A life without daily self-improvement has no meaning. We live in order to make ourselves better. No one can control where they're born or what kind of family they're born into. These conditions are naturally unique. But there is one thing we have in common. Our future will be determined by our effort. Thus, our future is our own responsibility. No matter how hard things seem today, with a positive attitude, we can all find joy in the midst of our troubles. ([Time 1:04:08](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5ea080b5-d434-4a16-91c0-ea16894edc9e))
