- Getty was born rich and his father showed him the way and he used this knowledge to build his empire. Always credited his father with his head start. Gettys dad teaches him self reliance and character. His dad gets oil fever and 44 of his first 45 wells hit and becomes rich. He hires his son but makes him start at the bottom living in a bunk house doing the dirtiest and hardest job in the business making $3 a day working 12 hours living in a bunk house this teaches him hard work and he loves it. When he was getting bad grades his dad sent him to military school and taught him the importance of reading and physical tasks from a young age. Was reading advanced books when he was 12 but dad also taught him about manual and hard labor. He learned the business from A-Z then his dad financed him to do wildcatting but gave gum the option to do anything. He choose oil but did not drill a good well in his entire first year and considered quitting. Old people kept encouraging him and eventually he drills a successful one this feeling of elation for success never left him.

    - **Note:** Gettys dad instilled hard work into him despite being born rich he worked as a laborer on the oil fields where he learned hard work self reliance. He also learned the business a-z which helped later. Was very curious always reading a lot. Dad gave him money to go out on his own and he failed for the first year until he finally struck gold. He never quit. He needed support and encouragement from others but the richest man almost quit before he started. Support from others in tough times can be vital.
- He becomes super rich at 23 and decides to retire and party, but then realizes it feels empty and gets back into the game. When his dad dies he never gets over it must continue the legacy of the greatest man he ever met. He’s a micro manager, workaholic, knows business a-z you can solve any problem , relationships run the world built business on these, he’s an autocrat he needed control. He needed to be a business the only thing that made him feel fully challenged and alive. He’s a learning machine self directed life long learning is the key to his success. He’s always got his hands in the details needs control. He needed full control because the box stopped with him and took full responsibility for his actions. Full agency. He’ll drill the wells if he needs to. Him being in the fields and being an oil man inspired his men who hated oil people we never visited the rig or didn’t know how to do the job. That accepted him as a member of the fraternity ([Time 0:15:27](https://share.snipd.com/snip/56cdab5f-b4dd-4c85-942e-6395e2929732))

- Financial Wisdom and Business Advice
  Summary:
  The importance of prudent financial management is highlighted through the example of managing air conditioning costs in museums to emphasize the prudent use of resources.
  The entrepreneur advocates for reinvesting in the business, maintaining a cash reserve, and using debt cautiously. Success is seen as linked to using credit sparingly in business endeavors.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  That's what, 5,000 miles away from you? And so I just want to read this to you. Air conditioning. I'm not impressed with the argument that our art objects will be ruined if air conditioning is not available 168 hours per week. I seem to remember that air conditioning was invented only a few years ago and that all of our 18th century objects necessarily passed a great many decades without the benefit of air Conditioning. My instructions are that air conditioning in the museums shall be turned off at all times at night and shall be used during the daytime only on those days which are exceptionally hot. We should have very little need for air conditioning." And then he obviously applies that to the finances of his business. He talks a lot about, he gives advice for fellow entrepreneurs throughout this entire book. And one of this is don't be like William Randolph Hearst. You should reinvest in your business and you have to keep a fortress of cash and use debt sparingly. This is what he says. I like to keep a lot of financial fat under my belt. There's nothing that can ever take the place of cash. The overwhelming majority of business problems and so many recent business failures result from businessmen exceeding themselves too far. There is most definitely a place and a need for the use of credit in business. However, I have always believed that the businessman who uses credit the most sparingly is the one who has the greatest chance for achieving success. And he talks about the fact that he lived next door. Oh, this is hilarious. ([Time 0:28:48](https://share.snipd.com/snip/85e81a61-ab6c-40ba-9411-f32b609c7fe2))
    - **Note:** He never used too much debt was cost-conscious and always used. Leverage sparingly kept cash. He always always reinvested in his business. Hearst would take money to buy $3 million homes and he would have a. 100 K Home. In 10 years he doubled hearst wealth. Always be reinvesting in the business. Innate capacity to think on a large scale was his jis great entrepreneur trait. Not in it for the money thinking long term view the business. He loves people who are resilient self starting and self restarting when they get knocked down. Autocratic tendencies made him a bad husband too needed control was very open about that. Had many wives success in business failure in marriage. 5 total marriages. Hatred of failure is what drove him and he had deep concentration on what he was doing, which created his success. Concentrate on what’s important to the exclusion of everything else not easily distracted.
- Acting Daringly Against Major Players
  Summary:
  A great businessman acts on opportunities despite financial constraints and advice to the contrary.
  In one case, an entrepreneur decided to buy shares in Tidewater Associated Oil Company to gain control, unaware that it was owned by Standard Oil of New Jersey, controlled by the powerful Rockefeller family. The businessman admitted that had he known this, he would not have pursued the shares, realizing he was too small to compete with such a major industry player.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  A good businessman feels these moments like a fall in the parametric pressure. A great businessman is dumb enough to act on them even when he cannot afford to. So going against the advice of the people advising him, right, and going against the current economic climate, he starts buying shares in this oil company called Tidewater Associated Oil Company. His idea was to accumulate enough shares so that he could win control of Tidewater. Now this is hilarious. Listen to what he says. Tidewater actually belonged to Standard Oil of New Jersey, which was controlled by the Rockefeller family. He didn't know it at the time because if you listen to the multiple episodes I've done on Rockefeller and his family, they constantly would hide. They'd have secret ownership in companies over and over again. They did not want people to know how rich they were. They did not want people to know how powerful they were. They love this network of secret allies. It says they actually belonged to the Standard Oil of New Jersey. Standard Oil of New Jersey was controlled by the Rockefeller family. Had I known this originally, I would never have begun buying Tidewater shares. For a pygmy independent operator such as I was, could hardly stand a chance against one of the world's largest and most powerful major oil companies.

    - **Note:** His dad dies and the lawyers tell him it’s during the depression. You need to consolidate your wealth, but he has the opposite opinion he sees this as a time when assets are cheap and he must expand Sam very few times do these key cards in the deck become available, that may never become available again you need to be bold and dumb enough to act. Take advantage of the crisis. It’s not easy to do this takes incredible temperament. He’s able to buy some of Rockefeller’s Empire at a discount through his cunning and focus, then decides to expand to Saudi Arabia, which had a ton of oil and had to build out all the infrastructure. This is when he unlocks his wealth to become the richest person ever. He need a tanker, super tankers, basically the entire infrastructure and decided that he was going to do it and did it was an immense task. Moves his entire life to Europe to be more in the business. It’s one thing to know what to do in a crisis it’s another thing to do it. It’s hard to overpay for a truly great business Charlie munger. He was going to buy land in Iraq, but a market panic spooked him and missed his opportunity, which would’ve made him very rich and 17 years later and another panic when he gets the chance to buy Saudi Arabia he doesn’t make the same mistake twice. People thought the deal he signed was horrible and it’s the deal that makes him the richest man in the world you can’t overpay for quality no price too high. He misses his biggest opportunity of his life and it takes him 17 years to get another shot. These opportunities are rare but when they come up no price is to high.
- Lessons from Family Tragedies and Building Relationships

  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Absolutely devastating. He experiences multiple family tragedies. His 12 -year -old son dies from complications of surgery. He had survived having a tumor taken out and then had a series of ongoing surgeries and died from complications of one. One of his grandsons gets kidnapped and he's famous or infamous for trying to negotiate with them. His whole point is like, I got 15 other grandchildren and if I just keep immediately paying out money, I'm signaling to the world that if you want to make money, just kidnap one of my kids. Different books on Getty, one of which is dedicated to like what happens, like this danger of, you know, he says, I wanted to create a dynasty. And much like the Kennedy family, the Kennedy family dynasty, because Joseph Kennedy had similar instincts, desires, there's just a lot of tragedy that happens there. So I'll read the book. I'm not sure if I'll make a podcast on it. If there is some lessons in there for you and I, then I will. But this guilt is present. He mentions it multiple times. He definitely had to live with doubt and guilt over the role that he played in his son's lives. And so moving on to another, I would say, tenet of his career is the fact that relationships around the world, he went out of his way when he's not working, and I guess this is considered Work as well, to build relationships with, you know, world -class entrepreneurs. He knew especially every single US president, nearly all the leaders of the countries in Europe and Middle East. But he did this intentionally.

    - **Note:** He put a lot of pressure on his sons and thinks that may have lied to his son, drinking himself to death. He was never the dad his father was and he regretted this, but it wasn’t in his personality. He created a building to build relationships and made his best deals with his friends relationships run the world. His best deals were with his friends who he trusted the most like Aristotle Onassis. It wasn’t greed that made him become a billionaire he just enjoyed the chase that came with oil didn’t love money just the game. That love of the process made him rich. Wanted to continue his dads hard work. Learned from history.
