  Speaker 1
  I'll just trade and broker and building up a business organically. But since 1989, I've been doing roughly about 500 acquisitions. I've done a lot of M&A. I love M&A. I love M&A as a way to create value for shareholders because I don't know of another way on a risk adjusted basis on a certainty level that is more likely to create massive shareholder Value than doing sensible M&A. In order to understand how to create value, I have to understand how am I going to scale up the business. I only know how to create tremendous shareholder value by growing a business tremendously. That's how I know how to do it. Of course, it's organic. I've had very good organic growths. The companies I've led have been well-performing companies that have had good market share and growing market share. We've taken customers away, we've taken business away from our competitors who aren't managed as well. But the real growth has been through M&A through acquisitions. What's been my secrets on acquisitions? It just is you first have to select an industry. You can't just do M&A. I spent the last year going around studying dozens of industries looking at hundreds and hundreds of acquisition opportunities, mostly with Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and some Other sequoia and some friends, figuring out, could I apply my playbook to this industry? Is the industry big enough? Is the industry fragmented enough? Is there M&A to do? Is bigger better? That's not always the case. Are the economies of scale? Do you have an advantage by being bigger? Is there a way to apply technology? My companies have always been tech-forward to the industry because the industry is a little sleepy on technology. Is the way I run a business, the way I do the intake of people and the culture and the way we interact with each other and so forth that we've been talking about during this interview. Is that something that will work in this industry? Is it applied in this industry? Is it something related to something I know about? Industrial services for example. My companies since 1989 have been industrial services. I looked at many, many different industries and I settled on the one that checked every single box which was building products distribution and then in my company it's going to be QXO. M&A will be a big, big component of what we do. There are 800 billion dollars of distributors in Western Europe and in North America, which is where I want to plant my flag. I want to build a company that's called 50 billion dollars. I can do that. If there's an 800 billion dollar size, I can take 6% of that through acquisition and through organic growth. I can get to 50 billion dollars. There's many other industries that are nice but I'm not going to be able to get to 50 billion dollars. I want to get to 50 billion dollars. This industry there's a clear path of how I can do that and there's roughly about 7,000 distributors here in the United States. There's about almost twice that amount in Western Europe. There's roughly about 20,000 distributors. You've got to be very careful about who you buy. There has to be a reason why you're buying that company. There has to be a compelling strategic reason of why you're buying that company. What makes sense for that? Why is that good for customers? Why is that going to make our business a better business? Why does that fit with the other things that we've already bought and put together? How's it going to integrate? I like to look at the multiples that I pay for an acquisition. The price that I pay for an acquisition is very, very important because when I look at the levers of how we create shareholder value, what contributes to that? The biggest lever, the biggest component is the differential between when I raise capital at, due to my relationships with mostly institutional investors and because of the track Record, and what I can deploy that at on doing acquisitions. The second biggest lever is how much can I improve the businesses that I buy? There's many, many levers, but those are the two biggest levers. I pay close, when I've studied all these different industries, I've studied historical acquisition multiples. One of the reasons I like building product distribution is I believe that I'll be able to buy companies at lower multiples of their profit, then I'll be able to raise capital at. That's going to be a big, that decagio, that spread, that difference, that delta is going to create value, boom, just right away, right from the first day. Integration, you asked about integration. Integration is extremely important. Anybody can buy a company. It's not that hard. You send a document, you sign a document, it's a few dozen pages, lawyers have gone over it and you wire the money and you own it. That's not the hard part. The hard part is after you've selected the right industry, after you've selected the right companies within that industry to buy, after you've had disciplined so that you don't, so That you pay the right price for all those, then you have to integrate them. I've never run companies that have like hundreds of different companies all running separately with different names and different systems and different back offices. There's some level of decentralization where you need to be closer to the customer, but I have a very strong appetite for standardization. Standardization of the ERP system that you close the books with. So you close the books promptly right after the close of the month and then you can have standardized dashboards. All the managers have the same format of the numbers they're looking at, the KPIs, and they see them graphically very easy to understand. I like to see so they can benchmark every location to every other location, every district to other districts, every region to other regions. And for that you need standardization. I like to have very standardized HRIS, human resources system, where all the people in the organization and we'll build this company up. We'll have hundreds of thousands of employees. I need to have a standardized data system for all of our employees. Everyone's on the 401k. It's the same exact way of doing all the benefits are the same, all the performance appraisal is the same, compensation I can see right away. And every time we do an acquisition, I need to pull that information up right away while we're studying it quickly. So we have a competitive advantage against other bidders to see what would the synergies be. So I need standardized HR technology throughout everything. I need a standardized CRM, customer relationship management system like salesforce.com or this, several of all this as well, to be able to make sure we're looking at customers, the Attractiveness of those customers, the profitability of those customers, the size of their spend, so therefore the potential of those customers going forward.
