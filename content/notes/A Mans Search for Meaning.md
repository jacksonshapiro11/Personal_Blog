### Highlights

- Live as if you are living for the second time. Put meaning into your day and never give up hope. Before pows died they would just stay in bed and smoke cigarettes knowing at that point they had chosen pleasure over meaning

    - **Note:** Put meaning into your life choose meaning. Marcus said the same thing live as if you were living for the second time
- Replace fear with a wish that the item of your anxiety happens through this you can conquer. Approach the problem as a joke and embrace it the only way out is through. Man is nit a machine but a self deterministic being who can act different ways in different situations looking at a man as a simplified machine removes meaning from life and hurts the person making the simplification do his job because he doesn’t even understand the issue
- The meaning of life is subjective and changes moment to moment the meaning to life is the current meaning at the current time and will different. Meaning is something you find and grasp as it is ever changing. Past that initial meaning we can look to find meaning in love or find meaning in our suffering. Suffering is no longer suffering once we find a meaning for it. Suffering isn’t needed for meaning to suffer unnecessarily isn’t finding meaning it’s self destructive. Envision yourself on your death bed and see what regrets and meanings you derive from there a short life can be more full of joy and meaning than someone who lives to 100. The meaning of life is not meaningless but maybe to complex to grasp for our monkey brains so we just need to be optimistic and try to find meaning. Instead of living with every passing day actively attack the day and put meaning in it then at the end file the days meaning away with a physical or mental journal as a day well lived. Don’t let your life become a self fulfilling prophecy if you go in with an opinion f what will happen it is more likely to happen. Pleasure should be a byproduct of doing something you enjoy not a goal. You should not chase pleasure. Hyper reflection can have negative effects ie overthinking. Anticipating anxiety from what we read will happen will make us believe that will happen to us even if it is very unlikely ie reading webmd. Instead of having sex for an organism focus on the partner and the rest will come. Same model with other things in life

    - **Note:** The meaning of life is an active not a passive thing that we are responsible for creating and instilling in our days. Meaning is constantly evolving and found in everything love and suffering. We shouldn’t chase pleasure but seek to live form strong relationships and do what we love and pleasure will follow. We often oversell our anxiety and when the moment comes it’s never as bad. Keep a journal. Be open minded to life and live assumption free it’s often the most unbelievable things comes from places we don’t believe. Regret minimization framework and suffering and finding meaning in it but not doing it unnecessarily. Life is not meaningless but maybe too complex to grasp.
      Contemplate death. Don’t be an arm chair philosopher be a doer
- Striving to find meaning in your life is the primary motivational force in man vs the pleasure principal of the will to find pleasure. Everyone’s meaning is unique to them. Living with meaning is all that matters. What man needs is something pushing him not a meaningless or easy life to a challenging one with constant stressors and pushes

    - **Note:** Meaning vs pleasure. Finding meaning and living with it is more important than constantly being happy and satisfied. We’re meant to do things not be nothing and we need to find and grab those things

    - **Note:** Human nature remains constant through time some people want to help others want to destroy in the end everyone gets what they deserve. Shows people have ethics and virtues bad times reveal character.
- If there is a meaning in life there must be a meaning in suffering and death because those are apart of life. The way in which a man accepts his fate gives him the ability to give meaning to life. Whether he accepts suffering or forgoes it demonstrates whether he is worthy of his suffering. Those who lost their moral hold on the situation were as good as dead. A man who cannot see the end could not goal set and ceased living for the future. In robbing the present of its reality lead people not to see the good things in the camp and have no future orientation tough situations allow for spiritual growth. People who can look to the future positively have a future but those who give up faith and hope have none. He who has a why to live can bear this almost any how. People died more around Christmas because they hoped they’d get home by then and when they didn’t they lost hope never lose hope

    - **Note:** Meaning in all parts of life. He who can find a why can bear almost any how. Growth through hardship. Those who did not remain optimistic about the future or lost hope were as good as dead. Keep the faith. We need to be worthy of our suffering see meaning in it and grow.
- No one can judge unless he asks in a similar situation if he would not do the same. Everyone had an inner freedom a freedom to choose ones own attitude in a given set of circumstances to choose ones own way. No matter what happened you still had to make a judgement at the end of the day. The inner freedom to make choices is what gives life meaning. The person soMeone became was down to their inner choices whether the play thing of circumstances or your own person. The sort of person someone became was a result of inner decisions. Therefore any man can decide what should become of him mentally and spiritually. Be worth of your suffering. The last inner freedom cannot be lost

- An abnormal reaction to an abnormal situation is normal. When you get pushed past your point there’s always another level you think you need things you don’t you will survive. When all is lost it all becomes a joke or a game when they were taken to the camps they soon didn’t fear death because life was so bad and then all there was to do is live. Even at the camps when someone was struck what hurt was not the blow but the unreasonable nature of it. We aim to find patterns to actions the fact that none could be found was the worst part because everything meant nothing and pain and suffering were arbitrary nothing mattered everyone was completely apethety
- To live is the suffer to survive is to find meaning in the suffering. If there is a purpose in life and there is a purpose and suffering and dying which each person must figure out for themselves. He who has a why to live can conspire to any how. Don’t aim at success the more you aim the more you’ll miss it success cannot be pursued it will only ensue as a side effect of ones personal dedication to a cause greater than yourself or the surrender to someone or thing other than oneself. Let it happen by not caring about it

  Understand your situation and have sympathy for other’s situation. The last thing you lose in your inner freedom no one can tell you what to think or make you act in a certain way. No one can judge unless he asks in a similar situation if he would not do the same. Everyone had an inner freedom a freedom to choose ones own attitude in a given set of circumstances to choose ones own way. No matter what happened you still had to make a judgement at the end of the day. The inner freedom to make choices is what gives life meaning.
  Imbed meaning in your life do not flow through the days without meaning
