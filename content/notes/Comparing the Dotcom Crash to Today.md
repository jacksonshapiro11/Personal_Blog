### Highlights

- The Importance of Flexibility in Investment Management
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  If you're comfortable sharing, who else does that besides Berkshire?
  Speaker 1
  In terms of holding cash?
  Speaker 2
  I mean, holding gigantic near majority positions of your portfolio and cash for extended periods of time and that being completely okay.
  Speaker 1
  The important point there is, and sort of goes back to the context of why we set up TDM the way we did, our view like Buffett's view is you need that flexibility. And so most fund managers, certainly on the listed front, most fund managers have constraints. They can only have a maximum 10% cash or 90% invested. And on the private side, same thing, they've raised a fund with a time frame as a fund life. And so there's pressure to invest in a certain period of time. We don't have that pressure. That really goes to the heart of actually why we set ourselves up the way we have.
  Speaker 2
  This is sort of the natural effect of the phenomena that's been studied and tons of academic research about how individual investors always outperform institutional investors. You've sort of brought the flexibility of the individual investor to an institution.
  Speaker 1
  100%. ([Time 0:38:03](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d2b1f987-3362-4323-9891-eb780d524bc3))
    - **Note:** Importance of investment flexibility to take the right time frame. Median Bessemer cloud valuation was 15x revenue and to achieve 20% return they’d need to grow 30% a year for 10 years. The base rates are very low happen 5 times ever so when that’s you’re average case you’re hosed. At that point they were in 50% cash which the average fund manager couldn’t do. Then they went back in a couple months too early. Didn’t call the bottom but roughly right. Deploy capital slowly at that time.
- High Growth Tech Companies that Quickly Recovered from Market Crash
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Correct. So when you go to the situation where obviously the NASDAQ is market cap weighted, the largest companies have a very large impact on the outcome.
  Speaker 2
  So people might be wondering, wait, so for some specific set of companies, it only took three to four years to get all the way back to January 2000 level valuations for these high growth tech companies. What were the companies? What were some of the standouts in that index that we would know today?
  Speaker 3
  Actually, I have the list up in front of me. I have the appendix from the memo. It's pretty interesting to see what these companies are. So let's see, we've got Oracle. Apple is actually in here in the index. We talked about Microsoft taking forever. Apple recovered.
  Speaker 2
  Apple is already 25 years old.
  Speaker 3
  Yeah. Western digital. Intuit is in here. Adobe. Paychecks. Net app.
  Speaker 2
  Yeah, David, it's interesting. I guess I'm still kind of in the place of if I was trying to apply that lesson of making sure I stay in the high growth companies through this period of time, trying to sort of equate it to what it is today. And maybe Tom, is the Bessemer Cloud Index exhibiting some of these same signs of like the fastest to recover?
  Speaker 1
  It does look like history is repeating itself again. You got the fast growing index or the BVP index is up around 35%, which compares ([Time 0:54:27](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e31eb88f-b760-4250-993f-f03f5acbb883))
    - **Note:** The high growth tech companies at this time recovered much faster than the average and these were 50mm revenue companies growing at 20% (I think) so not just the shit companies. These were the companies that recovered quickest in the first 12 months and within 2 years were up 1.4x off the bottom. Correlation high initially then dispersion. Over time the best fundamental companies still outperform which is what this proved. Value creation over the long term. They put prime importance on valuation. Buffet made 25% in coke in the first 10 years but over the life they stock is only up 10% compounded so you need to reasses and valuation does make a difference you need to let go.
- Why ethical considerations guide VC investments
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So well, they're not for us, that's probably the simple answer to that. We only have to invest in 10 to 15 businesses, and we want to be proud of those businesses that we invest in. We want to be proud to own them, we want to be proud the way they behave. In simple terms, those businesses are not for us. In time, though, I would say our view is that we'll unwind, and so they may have a very powerful position today that allows them to do that. It allows to treat their people in that way, but ultimately, we would argue over a long period of time those businesses regardless of their power, so to speak, will most likely be disrupted. It's hard to be durable when you're... Correct. Very hard to be durable if you treat your key asset, which pretty much in every single business is your people.
  Speaker 2
  Well, I think this is a great place to leave it. We will put the link in the show notes if you're interested in checking out the full memo, and Tom, I'm curious for you, any other parting thoughts to leave folks with as we settle in here.
  Speaker 1
  Well, I think my parting thought is investing is hard, and I think when you live this every day, it's not easy, and I've said it a number of times, but the thing that we focus on a lot and certainly would advise anyone we speak to around investing to focus on is that emotional stability front. You have to be able to wear the volatility to get wonderful returns over long term, and from an investor's perspective, that's probably the key thing to think about as we think about these tough times.
  Speaker 2
  Well, Tom, that is a great, great place to leave it. Where can people find you or TDM on the internet?
  Speaker 1
  So, where can you find me? ([Time 1:09:24](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e96ed0bd-7cc2-4e2f-9a1b-7cf48f097fe2))
    - **Note:** Investing is hard and much of the differentiation comes through emotional stability. The people at a company are a key source of differentiation you need to treat your people very well.
