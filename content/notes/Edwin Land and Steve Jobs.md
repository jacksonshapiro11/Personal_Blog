### Highlights

- Cultivating Curiosity and Creative Confidence
  Summary:
  Encouraging exploration and hands-on learning in childhood fosters creativity and innovation.
  Both Steve Jobs and his son exemplified this through early experiences of building and manipulating devices, highlighting the importance of understanding that everything is constructed by someone. Moreover, depth and breadth of knowledge are essential; cultivating diverse interests, from science to the arts, enriches personal and intellectual development.
  This holistic approach counters the stereotype of introversion, showcasing that confidence in ideas can coexist with a broad cultural understanding.

  And when Steve was five years old, he took Steve in the garage, cleared off a part of his workbench and said Steve this is now your workbench and he showed his son how to build things that You could manipulate the devices and the things that are in the house and that everything around you was made by somebody else and they had to learn how to do that and so his father encouraged Him to take things apart to realize that you can build new things you can combine new things in interesting ways. And it's fascinating that Land is doing this at six years old, because Jobs was doing the exact same thing at that age. The second thing I want to point out to you is that they both optimized for breadth as well as depth. They did not, this is one of the biggest criticisms that Steve Jobs had of Bill Gates. He has a hilarious quote where he's like, he would have been a broader person if he would have dropped acid. So it says, Land was introverted in person, but supremely confident when it came to his ideas. Accustomed as we are today to the Silicon Valley style, this may imply that he was a big nerd, but that is not right. Alongside his scientific passions lay knowledge of art, music, and literature. He was a cultured person, growing even more so as he got older, and this is why that's so important, ([Time 0:08:01](https://share.snipd.com/snip/08b15950-7c59-444c-afe5-5cc9daf4a494))
    - **Note:** Always breath and debts they had and valued technology, but also arts always a tinkerer from my young age. He wanted to work with artist, not just engineers. The rennisance men were did this too. Lande looked for the smartest art history department. They were hiring women who were overlooked by others He hated being told what to do. He found what he wanted to do and then did it until he died. Follow what gives you energy he loved light from a child. By the time he’s 37 lande has achieved everything but success. He has many acts and completely redefined his company multiple times. Missionires create better products. They started doing polarizers for cars then went into cameras. Focused on road safety but when he sold to the government, they didn’t want it because they weren’t the ultimate buyer so he always went direct. He over optimized his professional life at the expense of his personal life. Great inventions are obvious after the fact. Perseverance. The great products are sold by demonstrations. Nothing is better than a demo.
- Eerie Coincidences Spark Publicity
  Summary:
  The accidental similarity between a Polaroid photo and the subject's actual appearance generated significant media attention in 1947, demonstrating the power of strategic publicity in enhancing commercial success.
  This incident mirrored the publicity generated by dynamic figures like Steve Jobs, emphasizing the value of dramatic demonstrations in marketing. Polaroid's achievement rested not only on their patentable invention but also on their exceptional ability to capture public interest, ultimately positioning them at the forefront of a minimally evolved amateur photography landscape since Kodak's inception.

  It may have been an accident that the 8x10 camera produced a photo almost the same size of his actual face, but it only added to the eeriness. There was Land sitting at a table in his striped tie displaying a fresh picture in which he sat at the same table wearing the same striped tie. This is happening in 1947. A gasp rippled around the room. Newspapers all over the country ran the story. So again, I just got done saying how much free publicity did the media give Steve Jobs because of his dramatic demonstration skills. Same exact thing is happening here. This has built the success, the commercial success that Polaroid enjoyed was built on this. The fact that not only did they have an invention that was patentable, right? The one they own completely and the one they can sell directly to customers, but they were gifted at getting publicity. One day I'll learn how to pronounce that word. And the reason that it was such an important story is because it was a genuine technological advancement. And they talk about this. Remember that amateur photography in 1947 had come along only a modest amount since George Eastman, that's the founder of Kodak, first film in 1888.

    - **Note:** Demonstrations create free publicity. Hire a paid critic lande hired a famous photographer, and kept him on the payroll for life. Had the best photographer on retainer. Lande was a dictator. She would like himself in rooms, intense Focus hour after hour. Marketed Paul as an aspirational product
- Inevitability of Decline: Adapt or Perish
  Summary:
  Market windows are finite, and timing is crucial for the success of innovations; being ahead of the curve is essential to avoid losses that can mount into hundreds of millions.
  The failure of Polavision exemplifies how even pioneering entrepreneurs like Edwin Land can falter when market demand cannot sustain development costs, emphasizing that eventual failure is a certainty for all businesses. Historical evidence shows a grim outlook on long-term business survival, reinforcing the need for a realistic approach toward success while remaining dedicated to one’s craft without succumbing to despair.
  Succession planning is vital, as shown by Polaroid's decline post-Land, highlighting that leadership transitions can significantly impact an organization's fate.

  And a demonstration was arranged. So after the demonstration, Land asked Morita, well, what do you think of that? Morita responded, ah, well, you could sell $50,000 of anything. It's an unbelievable scientific development, but you're too late. He was right. The number of buyers couldn't begin to cover the development costs. The ledger showed a $68 million write-down. I've seen other estimates that the number is five times as large, that they lost hundreds of millions of dollars on this. For the first time, Land's ego and high handedness were backed up by a perfect sense of what people wanted. And so the two notes I had was Akia Morita knew PoloVision was too late. The other was eventual failure is inevitable. No one stays on top forever. And that is something I learned from grandpa Charlie Munger. And so think about how many businesses and founders Charlie has analyzed over his extremely long career. And I think it adds weight to what he says here. Over the very long term, history shows that the chances of any business surviving in a manner agreeable to a company's owners are slim at best. So I read that a long time ago. That comes from the book, The Towel of Charlie Munger. I saw the note I left myself a few years ago when I read that. And it says, you should take your craft seriously, but don't make yourself miserable. None of us get out of this alive. So again, Charlie says, over the very long term, history shows that the chances of any business surviving in a manner agreeable to a company's owners are slim at best. Edwin Land is one of the greatest entrepreneurs to ever do it. But if you live long enough, failure is inevitable. And so as a result of the failure of Polavision, there's a reorganization. Land still is there, but the president is now Bill McCune. And so this is where Land and Polaroid break up. In 1978, Polaroid had more than 20,000 employees. By 1991, it had 5,000. A decade later, Polaroid was bankrupt. Was the problem simply that Polaroid did not work without Edwin Land? Ken Olson, the chairman of Digital Equipment Corporation and a longtime Polaroid board member, said that Land was teaching him how not to do succession.

    - **Note:** Failure is inevitable don’t be too serious we don’t get out of this alive.
