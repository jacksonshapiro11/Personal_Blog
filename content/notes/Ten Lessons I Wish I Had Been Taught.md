### Highlights

- a. Every lecture should make only one main point.
  The German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel wrote that any philosopher who uses the word “and” too often cannot be a good philosopher. I think he was right, at least insofar as lecturing goes. Every lecture should state one main point and repeat it over and over, like a theme with vari- ations. An audience is like a herd of cows, mov- ing slowly in the direction they are being driven towards. If we make one point, we have a good chance that the audience will take the right di- rection; if we make several points, then the cows will scatter all over the field. The audience will lose interest and everyone will go back to the thoughts they interrupted in order to come to our lecture.
  b. Never run overtime.
  Running overtime is the one unforgivable error a lecturer can make. After fifty minutes (one microcentury as von Neumann used to say) everybody’s attention will turn elsewhere even if we are trying to prove the Riemann hypothe- sis. One minute overtime can destroy the best of lectures.
  c. Relate to your audience.
  As you enter the lecture hall, try to spot some- one in the audience with whose work you have some familiarity. Quickly rearrange your pre- sentation so as to manage to mention some of that person’s work. In this way, you will guar- antee that at least one person will follow with rapt attention, and you will make a friend to boot.

    - **Note:** Delete most of b. lectures should be clear in their ideas and concise in their message. Don't get lost in the sauce and relate to your audience
- Riesz would publish the first rough ver- sion of an idea in some obscure Hungarian jour- nal. A few years later he would send a series of notes to the French Academy’s Comptes Rendus in which the same material was further elabo- rated. A few more years would pass, and he would publish the definitive paper, either in French or in English.
  Adam Koranyi, who took courses with Fred- erick Riesz, told me that Riesz would lecture on the same subject year after year while meditat- ing on the definitive version to be written. No wonder the final version was perfect. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hegh1edec70caq1k97ssbg1g))

- sentially an updating of some paragraphs from a book by Edmund Husserl, with a few examples added. While I was waiting for the worst at the next meeting of the Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy, a prominent phe- nomenologist rushed towards me with a smile on his face. He was full of praise for my paper, and he strongly encouraged me to further de- velop the novel and original ideas presented in it.

- It so happens that the fundamental treatises of phenomenology are written in thick, heavy, philosophical German. Tradition demands that no examples ever be given of what one is talk- ing about. One day I decided, not without seri- ous misgivings, to publish a paper that was es- ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hegh8ds93tq6yhbheyvft0qc))
- Use the Feynman Method Richard Feynman was fond of giving the fol- lowing advice on how to be a genius. You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems con- stantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit, and people will say, “How did he do it? He must be a genius!” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01heghj6dgcna1x5wtppt861r5))

- Be Prepared for Old Age My late friend Stan Ulam used to remark that his life was sharply divided into two halves. In the first half, he was always the youngest person in the group; in the second half, he was always the oldest. There was no transitional period.
  I now realize how right he was. The etiquette of old age does not seem to have been written up, and we have to learn it the hard way. It de- pends on a basic realization, which takes time to adjust to. You must realize that after reach- ing a certain age you are no longer viewed as a person. You become an institution, and you are treated the way institutions are treated. You are expected to behave like a piece of period furni- ture, an architectural landmark, or an incunab- ulum.
  It matters little whether you keep publishing or not. If your papers are no good, they will say, “What did you expect? He is a fixture!”; and if an occasional paper of yours is found to be in- teresting, they will say, “What did you expect? He has been working at this all his life!” The only sensible response is to enjoy playing your newly found role as an institution.
