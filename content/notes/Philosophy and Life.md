### Highlights

- We shouldn’t just live to jump through the hoops of normativity with as little trouble as possible betrays our ability to be and do much more through education/ self education and reflection and aim for something higher ethically and morally. Normativity abuses humans and the planet by not letting us realize our full selves in this life. The good life isn’t just knowing but also rises to the higher level of understanding. When we make acquaintances with thoughts and reflect on them. Knowledge and understanding are importsnt but insufficient it not applied. The ethical and political are connected you need a good society to live a good life. Those who don’t take action in politics are doomed to be ruled by the lesser men of their time. The government must transcend politics. We must inquire learn and reflect its our duty to the world. Social beings wither without good relationships. What is the more you want to pursue in your life to contribute to society. We live to make sense of things and improve the world. Short life with width not narrow life with length. Live a curious life with a desire to learn and know is powerful. We must think what matters to us in our universe and create a personal circulum to live it. Accept responsibility to choose. To think is to grasp the implicit choices of seeing things in a certain way. The act of existence in a conscious way embodies the responsibility to choose. Struggle against nature and the world to find meaning is the same success is not the essence of life but lies in the journey you take. Philosophy of life is a product of one’s agency it must be a product of one’s own so it can be authentic to us and our life is our own chosen and lived. We all live an unconscious philosophy. Philosophy is preparation and living. To prepare for life and what the future holds. Hoping your life will turn out alright isn’t philosophy seeking to make it turn out alright is Philosophy. You may fail but real success is in trying not outcomes. Living a life of repetition means you live less than a full life but likewise living a life of deep meaning and creativity in every day can lead you to live many lives in one.

    - **Note:** The goal of life isn’t to live in normativity but to be an active agent. To both learn and apply that knowledge to live a wide not narrow life. To have meaningful relationships. Find out what matters to us discover the intentional life and live it with vigor. Success is in the process not outcomes.
- Philosophy is about implementation and constantly repeating things to yourself meditating on the life that you wanna live. Philosophy is a way of life you are someone who is a philosopher. anchoring to externals is not holy wrong like the stoic, etc., but it’s about letting the right externals in. You get to choose what hurts you. There is what is necessary and sufficient necessary and excess and unnecessary excess like food, eating to indulge, and social status. Philosophy teaches rules but we should become active agents not automita to these rules. 2 theories of philosophy one says detach from the world avoid negative externals others say we need to live and impact the world positively so we must accept the negatives in the world. We should have an eclectic philosophy that pulls from many ideas don’t become dogmatic to one school but everyone is different and we should pick the parts of each school that word and adapt to a life that is uniquely us. We must borrow the best from other schools to form our philosophy. The best teachers are the ones that inspire scholarship and teach people how to learn. A bad teacher destroys confidence and good tester inspires a student to teach themselves

    - **Note:** Philosophy is about figuring out the life we want to live and living it. It is a way of life. Don't anchor to externals but choose what you let in and what hurts you. There is what you need, air, what you sufficiently need, food, and things you dont need like status. We must learn the rules but live dynamically. Good teachers inspire scholarship bad teachers hurt knowledge. Our philosophy should be a non-dogmatic amalgamation of the best of every school that works for us. We can either withdraw like a monk or live positively and impact the world despite the negatives. Break rules well
- We pursue things and lose ourself beyond ourselves, with transcendent aims that allow us to exist. We surpass ourself through ourself. We can only grasp objects relative to their surpassing and we are the center of our transcendent universe. We realize ourself by realizing our humanity. Reject normativity which leads to absence of normative values in a freedom of choice. Inescapablilty of choice. This really is a good philosophy for young adults reaching the agency inflection point in their life. The idea that rapid responsibility and autonomy meets people after graduating college and leads to a crisis in meaning. Go from dependency to freedom with a ton of autonomy that leads to fear. What is exposed in these person crisis is what one should do who one should be how to see and live life itself. Once they are asked they must be answered they can be delayed but they will always arise later like a mid life crisis. These questions will always haunt you until you answer them. This comes in the divorce the diagnosis or realization that your career is over. You’ll often have competing desires and there is no one coming to save you to make this answer you must decide for yourself. Our ultimate choice is our own. We must choose and our choices. Us our first choice is whether to live or die. To live is to pursue a life of meaning. Some people pursue a normative life and are constantly distracted by continuous nonsense. Never thinking of the world. We live a distracted life which prevents us from finding meaning. We get martialed by the joint effect of our many conspiracies in a faceless crowd down a faceless road. When those seeking meaning reach the end of the hallway they don’t fall but fly. They see a world of something more than normativity and reached for it. Humans slip into rote habit with capacities underutilized. What kind of life are you living in? Why and is it enough or not enough? If it’s not enough what will you do. The search for meaning aims to change the ships course on the ocean.

    - **Note:** We can only transcend ourselves through ourselves by asking the important questions of the examined life and living not the normative path but choosing our own. Once we start to consider the deeper questions of life we must answer them or they will linger forever in our heads. We have inflection points in our lives where we must make choices and no one is coming to save us we must take agency and choose our lives. Sometimes factors choose for us like divorce or death other times we choose before that but the choice is ours and not choosing is a choice in itself. We distract ourselves from the meaningful life by random hobbies but the search for meaning is a directed life. We live in a distracted world how will we rise above that distraction and live the life we want. How will we be enough for ourselves
- Nitzche the meaning of life is to strive and overcome to be a Superman. To live as positively as nobly and courageously as possible. He was not a nihilist or pessimism, but he attacked when people removed religion without substituting in anything into the hole in his life. He saw rejection of traditional values as people losing faith in themselves. People need to keep the faith in man. Nitzche didn’t believe everyone could achieve the Superman, but did so with regret, hoping that everyone could but realistically viewing it as not possible for everyone. Many who start with high hopes fail it is a regretful thought. Hiediger to be is to be part of the world. Disclosures is brought out by anxiety and care. Anxiety is a general mood of dread or anguish, not fear. Disclosure is care which is achieved by 3 components throwness projection, and fallenness. We are thrown into this world without knowing why here why now, projection using things around us to release our anxiety and fallenness, distracting ourselves from reaching authenticity. Only by achieving authenticity can the anguish of existence, be overcome. Existentialism is an idea of optimism that humans exist before they could be defined. We discover ourselves and we create ourself. Man only exists when he attains who he wants to be. He is not responsible just for himself but for all man. Jean Paul satre ideas are included above. People need to find the answer of what should I do? We cannot obtain anything like spiritual or enlightened without association to others. Human kingdom is a pattern of values. Not choosing is a choice. One can choose anything in the plane of free action. Existentialism is an optimistic doctrine of action and only by losing ourselves beyond ourselves do we exist.

    - **Note:** Man only exists when he attains who he wants to be. Nitzche the meaning of live is strength to overcome yourself and be the super man live nobly and courageously. He was sad for the rejection of traditional values and people losing faith. He saw value in religion and believed everyone could achieve the superman but few would. Anxiety is dread not fear. Were throwin into the world use things around us to release anxiety and this distracts ourselves from reaching our authenticity. Only by being ourselves can we overcome our existence. We only exist when we attain the person we want to be. We need to be associated to others. Not choosing is a choice.
- Distractions of religion and consumer culture keep us distracted from distraction by distraction, constantly fed information never allowed to think. Distraction alienates us from ourselves. Existentialism we are dropped in this universe with no plan. I need to figure out our lives for ourselves. We have no blueprint so we must create ourselves and do so honestly and authentically to us. We are in bed value in our lives through self creation. The world is absurd and meaningless we create ourselves by rising above the limits of facitcitly authentically our values emerge from creating ourselves. Key tenants are radical freedom, self creation authenticity choice responsibility facticity effort to transcend and the subjective feelings when we transcend. We come into the world without a blueprint and need to create who we are. Existence proceeds essence. Freedom is anchored in the fact that we are constantly out of choice and we must make a choice whether it’s doing something or even passing on the choice. Freedom is that constant force. Choosing is self creating. Camus myth Sisyphus the one philosophical problem is suicide in an absurd world. Why should we not just kill ourselves? What meeting can we find in the absurdity? Kamu says we should rebel against uncertainty and in someway conquer it. Our fate belongs to us. This philosophy addresses how we deal with uncertainty and was very popular during World War II.

    - **Note:** Consumer culture keeps us distracted with distractions from our self constantly running from who we are inside and are inability to see ourselves for who we are leads us to lose side of who we are. The world is absurd and meaningless and freedom is something we give ourselves. radical freedom, self creation authenticity choice responsibility facticity effort to transcend. We need to truly see and believe in ourselves. We come into the world confused without a blueprint and spend our lives struggling to find one. Freedom anchored in our agency our life belongs to us. No one is coming to save you. Dont waste life make use of your time. Every moment gives us a choice and not choosing is a choice.
- The meaning of your life is what you make it. Take individual responsibility for every interaction. The ethical life is a creative experience for you within your life. Normative the idea of making it through life with the boxes ticked good job good mortgage is a good life even if we have to give up some of the dreams of our youth. Most people are content with this instead of rebelling against it. Accept practicalities of life blunt youthful dreams. We need to accepted disappointments life will never be perfect. Normative life accepts money and status are natural things to get in society where classical values reject that. Want to pursue eating well/ being healthy/ exercising meaningful relationships contribution to family. Is contentment enough a life worth living. 3 levels of life question 1. What is the meaning of life 2. What is a life worth living 3. What is a life meaningful or impactful to society. The Stoics rejected society seeing impact on it as vanity while now we look at success as positive meaning like changing the world as good which they would have seen as a vain pursuit. All humans search for meaning and a lack of meaning leads to neurosis in the work of Frankle and Jung they think meaning is center to a good life. The people who die the many nameless is cemeteries might not have world changing meaning but maybe they found meaning in raising a family. Finding meaning to some degree is vital to a meaningful life. The normative and religious life can give and create meaning in life.
- How to exist in society cites prisoners dilemma on cooperation and having social rules around manners in dining is good so we’re not shitting at the table. We’re driven by self interest but also cooperation and empathy is what leads to species surviving. Empathy is a vital human emotion understanding others walking a mile in their shoes is how we exist in society some people like cynics and stoics rejected all society but we must live in it so we must choose how to exist within it. Society is the element of humanity like water to fish we constantly swim in it. Silence can convey meaning it’s not just not saying words silence has meaning.
    - **Tags:** #this-is-water, #social-creatures-(humans), #social-order, #empathy/sympathy-(understand-others-perspective), #silence-in-conversations
    - **Note:** There are many societal rules and things like empathy are key to existing in society. We need to empathize with others and society is much like water. It’s always around us and unseen. Silent can speak volumes.
- Historically the idea of duty was ingrained in who we are in society through explicit social classes peasants and lords had duties and a way to act based on their class. We no longer have these explicit duties but still must conform to implicit duties and actions to conform to our society. While we live in a free society inability to conform to dogmas of society will make us look weird and different effectively ostracizing us from society implicitly. Society expects certain actions that becomes our duty that we have no choice but to conform to. The structure still exists and we need to live in societies bounds if we want to eat and make a living. We are constantly making choices and it gets harder with time we can always change. Choices are mostly made when we’re young and inexperienced and it’s hard to change our minds once we commit to something but it obviously can be done. It gets harder with time and we can change. We have options and we can change our mind and make new choices. How long will you delay to become wise. It is never too late to become wise. Ownership is liberating and empowering. Cynic would say wisdom comes from changing practice of what you do stoic attitude toward situations and we should be indifferent to what we can’t change own your life. We should use our imagination to create our world. We need to use our mental freedom to expand our life.

    - **Note:** Duty used to be an explicit thing but now it is an implicit thing. We live in a free world but our duties almost bind us more because they are soft rules with hard consequences for breaking them. Societal duties are implicit. We are forced to conform or starve and be excommunicated.
      We are constantly making choices and always have options but these ossify over time and become harder the change. We can always change. Wisdom waits for everyone. How long will you delay becoming wise. It is never too late.
      Agency and ownership is liberating and empowering. Wisdom comes from changing practice (cynic view). Stoics say wisdom is through acceptance and indifference. We should use our mental freedom to create our own world. Attack life
- We view luck and morality differently if 2 men accidents had their gun go off one bullet hit a tree the other killed a girl we view one as worse but luck drives a lot of moral beliefs we have about the world. Moral luck is a massive problem and very difficult to argue either way. Being born into crime vs wealth we hold someone responsible for actions and following a path in one regard and praise the other but both are luck. Our society accepts lock as part of moral judgment when it’s unchangeable in the case of the shooting example but many more. Can we be a good person by accident. We put ethics above morality we have to punish people who do wrong even though it wasn’t their fault. likewise being born in the wrong place has a big effect on your happiness, but you don’t get any special rules to commit crimes. We have to accept the possibility of having a good life is outside and agents control. However we can find good in bad situations like concentration camps through sheer will. He who had a why can bear almost any how. Moral luck is at the center of a lot of life. We need to reflect on harder times and apply them and their lessons like what learned in concentration camps to ordinary life because once we integrated in our ordinary life, we can create it in and call on it when we need it. There is always trouble ahead and philosophy prepares us for this trouble. We will experience loss grief and failure and bad luck or an accident that changes our life. We needs a compromise on the hopes and ambitions we had at the beginning of our life. Life can be changed in a chance accident. Reflect and formulate your response to random horrible accidents. You’re not a victim of bad factors just the subject of them and you shape them how you will that is the point of contemplation and philosophy. If Socrates, question can be answered in Auschwitz it can be answered anywhere we can be a good person in any situation even the worst.

    - **Note:** Luck and morality is something we accept and we have to a society only functions when we punish bad luck to some regard. Further this does not rob of of agency happiness can be found everywhere and we need to accept our lives will not turn out how we dreamed and then live them to our best. We need to be a good person and sperate the process from the outcomes and accept the outcome. We get no second chances at life and we need to move past the unfortunate and accept the situation good and bad for as it is. Accept life dont postpone regardless even in failure and bad luck. Were defined by our response to failure
      Morality and luck is tied. We must accept life as is and move on we have no excuse for bad behavior. We will lose and fail but thats life
- 3 definitions of good life 1 the life of pleasure 2 the morally right and pious life 3 good to live because the person living it feels it’s meaningful ie a meaningful life. It’s very tough to live a good life in a war zone or heavy poverty you need initial conditions. In terrible times like concentration camps there were 3 people the ones that gave up and died the ones that difected and helped the Nazis as a kappo or prison guard who was a prisoner these people were especially harsh and needed to be to hold their position then there was the people who dug deep and used mental strength to persevere you couldn’t accept the life and meager rations you needed to use agency and active intelligence to survive. They used all their self control to survive the ones who died easily accepted their situation and what the guards told them. The nazis who ran the camps were given alcohol to cope and justified these killings as someone less than human they were also chosen from there people available but it wasn’t easy to cope so the nazis even himler himself couldn’t deal with the pain from watching it only in the 3rd person. The nazis really just gave into a rote repetition of things the holocaust was more about doing your job and logistics than murder making lists rounding up people everyone doing their small task refusing to see the bigger picture created this atrocity. Rote going through life. However the thing was humanity didn’t die in the worst circumstances. Power reveals character and many men were made worse but some kappos looked the other way when there was extra bread or soup to be had. Some prisoners gave extra food banned together showing beautiful humanity in the worst time. Logotherapy people struggle most with loss of direction and values. The men who survived didn’t protect their body but risked it and put it on the line constantly through courage and risk they survived.

    - **Note:** There are three types of people the ones you give up the ones who move with society and the ones that moved with their inner clock and transcend. Live for pleasure morals or meaning. It’s tough to find meaning and suffering, but people are able to. Normative life of people looking the other way from atrocities that’s not how you’re supposed to live. Power reveals humanity and character. When you’re in a tough situation, you cannot protect. You need to risk even when you’re afraid.
- Happy marriages are all alike in the same way the result of individually found solutions to circumstances. while unhappy marriages struggle from insufficient money resentment alcohol brutality infidelity. Love and marriage have traditionally been very different with the 2 only becoming joined recently. Also people have an idealized person in their mind and their partner just fits that. People love an idea and work to find the closest thing to that idea in the real world. Romance in the classical sense was rare but it was revived in novels and 1800s literature. Wisdom comes from clarity and a clear understanding of the world and pain comes from confusion of the world. Most marriages fail > 50% humans are polygamous and marriages only survive because of massive compromise or finding friendship above love. Classic marriage usually fails and passionate love is only a small amount of a relationship. Marriage was traditionally a financial property and uniting families to have kids not a sexual thing affairs were accepted but must have been secret. Friendship is the highest calling and genuine mutual love through the ages all genuine relationships and marriages must be rooted in friendship. Friendship is the highest relationship calling my. When a friend dies our relationship doesn’t end but transfers to another dimension or world. Nothing can replace those we lose or cease to grieve but we learn to live with grief. We learn about love through losing love we see how deep it was.
- Death isn’t an internal thing it’s something experienced by others through grief. To us death is nothing, we die and experience nothing. The anxiety of an event we fear death but it’s nothing to us. Learning to die or fear death is irrelevant because it’s not part of our lives experience. We must look death in the face. Everyday is no different than one day. We can experience all the happiness in a lifetime in a day. It’s wrong to live under a constraint. The fact you must die should focus you on what you can control your life. We experience dying but not our death. Death seems bad because of what it takes away from us. Prospect of loss is what seems bad but loss in it of itself. Coward dies 1000 times over. The wise man mediates on life not death. Because we only see the world through our eyes and can’t see ourselves as dead we’re immortal. When we die we lose our present moment. Were the sum of past experience and future hope. We’d rather in society escape death and pretend it doesn’t exist rather than live accept it and integrate what those people say into our lives so they live through us and remember their love. We reject and are a society intolerant of death and leave dying to doctors in hospitals it’s not something that happens in normal society. We struggle to deal with death alot more than older people. Sorrow is natural and if we died we’d want people to move on so we should too. Although sorrows comes from outside it’s up to us how we receive them is up to us we must bear and master them stoic idea. Absence is a large presence in our lives that’s why bereavement is so hard. We can forget and move on but it never fully leaves us. We must accept the opportunity of loss as the contract we make with life. Death makes us create value in the life we live the end gives purpose to it all.

    - **Note:** Death isnt a part of our lives but only others experience of our lives. Death is meant to inspire life. We must make our peace with it and invest in our life so we live it to the fullest. We can live so much life in a short time or live with fear and die many times over. Accept death and live the life you want. Understanding it ends means you must be in a hurry to make it happen while you still have a shot. Also, our societies rejection and discomfort with death is very notable and shows some lacking tolerance with it for some reason which makes it harder for us to deal with. We must accept life for what it is
- Courage can both be an action and life description. It’s dependent on situations fleeing from battle and retreating are very similar but one could be considered courageous. To be a courageous person doesn’t mean you always do the courage thing. Coward dies a thousand deaths through anxiety it saps confidence and destroys opportunities. More things frighten us than crush us don’t be unnerved. Suffer more in imagination than reality. Justice is a civic virtue while mercy is a warrior virtue. You can do the right thing even when it’s against the law like pardoning someone from stealing bread. The right ethical move is doing your moral best in a situation. Being a vegiteran not a vegan isn’t as good but if it’s the best you can then it’s your moral best. Likewise this can justify a lie like when someone asks if they look fat. We need to do our moral best answer to a higher calling but obviously you can’t just use this to saying killing someonevwas my moral best. Ethics vs morals. Virtuous life transcends actions to craft your nature to be a person who performs actions. You’re not a person who did the utilitarian thing you are a good person. That’s the core of virtue not doing good but being good.

    - **Note:** The core of a virtuous life is being doing not doing good, but being good is the product of doing good actions. You are the sum of your actions at the end of the day. Morality isn't always clear sometiems the moral thing is to lie, but good morality is obvious and situationally dependent ie relative morality. Courage can be both an action and way of life. A coward dies many deaths and anxiety is worse than the event. Do your best. We suffer more in our heads than real life. Virtuous life means trying your best to always do the right thing and live your life how you best can achieve happiness
- Happiness isn’t a feeling, but it’s a life situation. Everyone can feel joy, but happiness is much deeper and ingrained in your life. It’s a condition of life. Happiness can’t come for deception and ignoring unwelcome truths but embracing and dealing with reality. Happiness is a situation not a feeling. Happiness comes from feelings of agency and worth/ contribution. Status chasing often leads to unhappiness. Happiness is an epiphenomena from things that are intrinsically worthwhile. You must use your autonomy to find something intrinsicly worthwhile. Happiness is living with reason in pursuit of virtue. Happiness isn’t pleasure but an emergent property of a life well lived true to yourself.

    - **Note:** Happiness is a life situation that comes from embracing your life. When you have feelings of agency and work and you’re doing what you enjoy. Live with reason pursue virtue. Happiness isn’t pleasure but emergent from the aligned well lived life.
- Buddism 4 noble truths. Life is suffering, suffering comes from ignorance and desire, suffering can be escaped, one can achieve liberation through meditation and an ethical life. 8 fold path - right vision/understanding, emotion, speech, action, livelihood, right effort, mindfulness, and meditation. Desire is the source of suffering. Meditation is meant to quiet the mind, empty at all distractions and promote/become more mindful. Primary existence is pure consciousness fully in tune with the mind and requires emptiness. Clear mind. Losing the self. Deep consciousness. Consciousness is extinction of the self. Djanism understand the self so you can transcend existence. Accept reality is infinitely complex and many sides so every viewpoint is not fully true and fallible, but has some level of truth in it as well

    - **Note:** We’re prisoners to our desire but we can liberate ourselves. Meditation clears the mind so you can see the world and be present through your mind. Deep consciousness and loss of self. We exist in multitudes and we should transcend ourselves.
- Motzi Indian philosopher preached utilitarian ethic/ anticipated it and brotherly love. Harm caused by hating others and trying to injure them it comes through selfishness. Thinks we should elevate the successful shiners of people. Daoism the world is one by those who let go when you try and try you can’t win. Just go with the flow the philosophy of the way. Way leads to transcendence of society and desire. There is no ways though there are many ways not just one. To follow the way is to unlock your potential. Before organized society people behaved effortlessly and society is what made us need to put effort to achieve the way. The way is doing things in a relaxed, non-striving manner. It’s like water blowing around rocks, acting without effort, accepting and being a part of the flow going with the flow honestly. This philosophy is going with the flow. Not getting stressed. Evolution of schools doesn’t mean improvement.

Being the water flowing around rocks and being the water with rocks flowing around you. There is no one way to live life there is just life and we must accept it. Life is a process not a thing. Realizing your potential.
- Aristotle see politics as in how to govern as the highest calling and the goal of life being udemonia or happiness this is an end in of itself which is the goal of life. Fully human person is someone who lives with reason in accordance with the 4 stoic virtues wisdom courage temperance and justice instead of giving into the instincts. Virtue makes the goal right and practical wisdom makes it achievable the golden mean. Pleasure and contemplation is vital in life but it’s not an end in itself. Epecurianism pleasure is the aim of life, but it’s not just pursuing pleasure but they’re broken into 3 groups the natural and necessary ones like eating the natural and unnecessary ones like sex and the unnatural and unnecessary ones like status or wealth. Efforts to acquire the third group leads to many anxieties and difficulties, and should be transcended and rejected. Pleasure as the goal of life is defined as the absence of pain in the body and trouble in the mind. Answer of living a good life of pleasure is through sober reasoning and banishing anxiety. We must understand the world is a material realm. Pursuit of pleasure is the pursuit of temperance, moderation, balance, and rationality not what we would think of his pleasure today. Death is not an evil. Placed a very high value on friendship. Socrates the point of life is to find a rational foundation for life. Happiness comes from within through self mastery.

    - **Note:** Happiness is an end in itself and politics is a high calling of human action. Living an active virtuous life is vital and achieving the golden mean. Pleasure and contemplation is vital but the are unnatural and unnecessary pleasures like wealth and status that should be avoided at all costs because they will destroy you. Pleasure if a clear mind and a full heart. Live a life of contemplated reasoning and free ourselves of anxiety in a balanced life. Have a personal philosophy and live up to it.
- Stoicism happiness comes from living with nature and is an offshoot of self-discipline and mastery. The external aspects of life don’t matter commit to your internal duty. Stoic internalize things and didn’t reject wealth, but treated externals with indifference. Those didn’t matter in what really mattered which was living with courage in the face of life challenges, which was aging death, pain illness and natural disaster and mastering the desires within ourselves. Happiness is reaching in equilibrium, which is a result of living with nature. Things that are always good are prudence, courage, moderation, and justice. Everything else can be sometimes good or sometimes bad and should be viewed within indifference. You can prefer things like wealth if they make your life slightly better but those are proximate goods which you shouldn’t seek over ultimate goods. Actions what we do passions are what we endure we must be apathetic in the face of these hardships. Master what lies within our control and face externals with courage. Stoic teaching it is our own attitude that makes something good or bad not any external agency. Perception vs interpretation. Epictetus is about self knowledge and self mastery delineating what is within and outside our power so we can find the good which is always within ourselves. Everything turns on our attitude and these lie under our control. Acceptance of inevitablity is freedom. When someone makes you angry it’s your judgement of the situation causing that anger. So don’t let your impressions carry you away. To learn to philosophize is to learn how to die frees us from the fear of it for whoever is free of the fear of death fears nothing and can live a full free life all anxieties in the world are useless you become free of all dispassionate pleasures.

    - **Note:** Life with nature treat externals with indifference. Live with courage in the face of life's challenges. Happiness is a golden mean living with nature. Virtue ethics of things always good. Prefer the good but understand these are not the root of happiness just a proximate cause. Grow through hardship and master our minds. Perception vs interpretation just understand what is in your control and what isn't accepting the inevitable is freedom. Learning how to live starts with accepting death because then we are free of anxiety and fear nothing. Courage indifference and perception. Freedom in surrender
- Philosophy in antiquity told people to think where religion told people to accept and obey this completely biases our world view to start with acceptance not doubt. The reformation pushed back on the church power and rediscovery of the Stoics and epicureans in the mainstream has led to the best answer we currently have to the Socratic question. In 2k years we haven’t gotten a better one wtf. These ideas of how to answer the question are put forward by advertising marketing ect of how to live a good life leading to our more consumer culture but ultimately the core philosophy remains unchanged. Socrates encouraged only that people think for themselves. His 2 real tenants were the examined life is the good one and knowledge is virtue but otherwise thought people should live the lives they wanted. Argues that people must consider and develop their own life philosophy there is no cookie cutter answer that is promised by so many religions and ideologies. The only answer is you think for yourself. Cynics are about living with nature virtue comes from actions and requires few words doesn’t concern the law but what is morally right. Rejecting convention and becoming very self disciplined. Goal of life is contentment and clarity of mind not conforming to societal dogma. Live without shame but didn’t move to the desert like others but live the cynic life in the middle of the city with all its desire. Simple life is route to happiness these people are viewed like hippies.

    - **Note:** Philosophy told people how to think religion what to think. We do not have a much better answer to the Socratic question of what life we should live now than we did 2k years ago.
      Socrates 2 main tenants thinking for yourself/ the examined life and knowledge is virtue.
      Everyone must create their own life philosophy there are no cookie cutter answers no one is coming to save you. You need to create and embed meaning in your own life. Don’t be dogmatic be creative.
      Cynics lived the simple life but did it in the city not in nature to show people it could be done.
- Free will may or may not exist which is a very important philosophical point. Likewise we don’t experience reality just how our brain interprets reality. Jackson view is better to assume free will or else nothing else matters anyways. We also in society agree the world is in party deterministic think assuming people are born not choose to be gay being accepted form of determinism. Even nurture is deterministic insofar as we’re shaped by community and cultural surroundings regardless of our choice. So there is deterministic nature and nurture. Indian schools source of suffering is essence of existence and they come up with ways to alleviate or avoid suffering. Humans are extremely vulnerable to suffering but also incredibly capable in its ability to transcend. Indians must save us from ignorance through knowledge Christianity is saving from original sin. All religions assume people have some kind of free will and agency to impact the world in some capacity. Ultimately we’re free to make choices in our life.

    - **Note:** Free will and determinism is a spectrum and a version of Pascal’s wager for free will makes sense. Path dependence in life. All religions allow some free will. Indian philosophy is we liberate from ignorance through knowledge by transcending suffering which is essential in life.
- We all have an implicit formula of life that we adopt from our society rarely do we ask the question and develop and explicit philosophy. Takes a big negative point in our lives, to ask questions and think ourselves there’s no reason we can’t do it without that negative experience. Socratic question what sort of person should I be/ values I should aim for. Virtues courage wisdom temperance and justice. There are more questions than answers in philosophy we must create the answers for ourselves. Happiness traditional was seen as a life situation not a passing feeling. Happiness was a good content life. Time is elastic while it’s finite when we do things we like time slows down and molds around us while in a rote repetition doing the same thing every day we can say we’ve lived a lifetime but also only 1 day. Experience affects our life and perception of our finite time. We live unconscious adopting a one sized all life path when we should instead think and adopt our norms. We live unconscious going through the motions living someone else’s life then die. Ask the hard questions of life transcendence comes from within. While life has changed the ideas and feelings have remained the same we want to have food be warm have friends and love. Want to be healthy we like good food and the sun. We exist in multitudes and have many dimensions to our life but also we have dominant personality at different times. Who are we? Truth of who we are is rooted in the story we tell ourselves about ourselves. Do we have a true self can we find that person.
