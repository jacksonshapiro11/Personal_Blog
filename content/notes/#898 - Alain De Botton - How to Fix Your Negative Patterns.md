### Highlights

- **Individuality and Maturity**
  * Our inner experiences are shaped by external factors like societal norms, past traumas, and habits, making it difficult to define our true selves.
  * True maturity involves discerning which aspects of ourselves align with our values and consciously choosing which to retain or discard.
  * This process of self-authorship involves editing and refining our thoughts, values, and actions to reflect our individual choices rather than simply conforming to our upbringing.
  * Children often exhibit authenticity in their unfiltered expressions, while teenagers tend to prioritize conformity, illustrating the complex journey of individuation.
  * Picasso's artistic development serves as an analogy, where maturity allows for integration of childlike spontaneity with refined skill and experience. He rediscovered his child like abilities with his older skills that’s what we’re all doing.
  * Going from unconscious incompetence to conscious competence is the journey of our lives.
  * The west views art as something very detailed and describes to you while in the east art is in many ways simple think of Confucius parables but you as the reader bring your skills and knowledge to the work to complete it while in the west the art stands there complete.

  Isn't it interesting that we're talking about maybe the thing people identify with most, you know, the texture of their own experience, the landscape of their inner mind. But you're then saying, well, this may not fully be self-generated. This might be something which you've absorbed from the past, from society, from norms, from cultures, from the way that you've you've compensated for past traumas, et cetera, or just Habits. But it brings up an interesting question, which is, okay, so who are you? Where are you in this? Are you that voice? In some ways you are because you're inexorably linked to all of the experiences you've had. But then we have this sort of transcendent us, which is better. It's the better us. If only I could.
  Alain De Botton
  It's the me without the compensation, the trauma, the et cetera. Such a good question. Sometimes there's this idea of the real me that is separate from everybody else. We are penetrated by society. Think of how we're speaking. We're using words as we speak to one another. Every one of those words is both spoken by us and was made by other people long before we were even a rumor in anyone's mind. We are penetrated by society. Every one of the words that I am using is the result of generations and generations of people who've used those words, refined meaning, et cetera, and then given them to me. So that's literally the language. We're permeated by social language. Even our biology, as we know, our gut bacteria is both us and not us. The neat, Chris, Alain, we are these entities where you can put a strict circle around. Now we're interpenetrated by society, biology, history, et cetera. So then the question comes, well, is there anything that's more me, less me? And I think here, absolutely, absolutely. And I think that one of the journeys, life's full of journeys, one of the journeys that I think we all are on is to start to separate out a little bit. Born, which of those bits do I want to keep or focus on and which of those bits do not fully represent my values, my considered choices, et cetera? And this is where life gets interesting because people start to say things like, well, where I come from, normal meant dot, dot, dot. But the more I think about it, the more I'm reflecting on who I really am, the more I want to ditch that and that and that. It's just a form of editing process. Self-authorship. Absolutely. And I think that the more mature someone is, I'll use that word because you've used others. The more mature someone is, the more what they do, what they think, the values they hold are more to their own work, their own sifting, their own editing than it does to the context that They were born into. If you look at the arc of a life, a very small child is often remarkably authentic, which is why we adults in small doses at least have such great time with little ones. Because they come out with stuff and you think, oh my God, I can't believe they've just said that thing. They've just said that granny's nose is too big or that this restaurant is boring or this very expensive thing is a load of rubbish, etc. They'll come out with stuff that is non-normative. And that's very interesting because as an adult, you recognise your own spontaneity that's been lost normally. So it's kind of bittersweet. You don't want exactly the child's version of it, because that would lead you into trouble. But you want an adult version, and it's very hard to get. And probably the high watermark of the opposite is when you're 14 and a half, and you're at school, and your most fervent wish is to be like everybody else. You want your parents to be like everybody else. You want your name to be like everybody else. You want your appearance, your haircut, et cetera. You cannot bear difference. And then slowly, slowly, you individuate. And that's a very exciting journey. I don't think anyone individuates in all areas. So I think the first choice is, what are the areas that matter a lot to you? I'm interested in individuation, but when it comes to clothes, you might have noticed, it's a really interesting area, but I'm just leaving that one for another time. I'm just not engaging with that. Similarly, food, fascinating area, very interesting. Not quite on my radar yet, but other areas, what I'm reading, very opinionated, very individual. So I don't think all of us can do it in all areas, but we choose. And that's also part of what makes someone an individual.
  Chris Williamson
  In that way. And yeah, trying to find the balance between what would the mature childlike version of ourselves do or say in this moment, where we found ourselves too swayed by the opinions of others, By expectations, by societal norms, etc.
  Alain De Botton
  Do you remember that story of Picasso, who was going around an art school, little kids were doing art, and some kid was sort of scrawling, you know, mummy, whatever. And this kid was seven. And Picasso said famously, when I was his age, I was painting like Raphael, you know, one of the great Renaissance artists. And it was sort of true. I mean, young Picasso. And then he went, and it's taken me all my life to remember how to paint like this. Now, he didn't, you know, an adult painting like a child is not a child painting like a child. It's something different, you know, which is why people go, oh, a child could have done that. Well, when a child does it, it's one thing. And when an adult does it, it's another thing. And I think it's quite different. And I think that's why, you know, when you look at Picasso, and there are lots of artists and lots of figures you could sort of draw that analogy with. But, you know, when you're looking at a painting that Picasso did when he was 90, you know, at the end of his life, and it's got elements of stuff that a child might do, but it's gone through. You know that this guy has been doing so much other stuff. ([Time 0:10:44](https://share.snipd.com/snip/63173aee-ff2e-4432-83d3-55822ef14b63))
- **Escaping Emotions**
  * People often avoid strong emotions like love and happiness, especially if their early experiences with these emotions were disruptive.
  * This avoidance stems from associating these emotions with past difficulties or perceived dangers, like upsetting a parent or challenging the household's dominant mood.
  * People develop defense mechanisms, like excessive reading or overachieving, as coping strategies for overwhelming situations.
  * These defenses, while once protective, can become obstacles to personal growth and genuine emotional experience.
  * Acknowledging and appreciating these defenses as past survival strategies is crucial for evolving and embracing a healthier relationship with emotions. We cling to these bad emotions because they’re comfortable but they don’t serve us. We do what makes us feel safe. Let go of those defensive structures. 
  * You need to keep investigating past experiences and grow through a deeper understanding of the past.

  Alain De Botton
  We know what emotions are like. They're not just lovely, cuddly things. They're absolutely terrifying a lot of the time. Think about love. We think that people spend their lives looking for love. And half true, that's a half truth, is spend a good deal of time running away from love as well in all sorts of forms. We are as assiduous in our escape from love as we are in our pursuit, perhaps more so. Why? Because it's terrifying. It's especially terrifying if you come from a childhood, a young world, where there was some kind of disruption in your attachments, in your experience of love. The next time you then meet love as an adult, half of you is just wanting to run away. And I think people don't still not fully appreciate enough the strength with which we are going to resist love if our earliest experience of it was in any way, in any way difficult. And this explains a great deal of the misery of the world.
  Chris Williamson
  Very interesting to think about how much we try and push away the thing that we're also wanting, like how we are complicit in creating the scenario that we're so terrified of having happened. I've been thinking a lot about second order emotions, third order emotions. So you have a thing that happens, you feel agitated, and then you begin to tell yourself a story and you become stressed at your agitation. And then you become resentful at your stress about your agitation, and then you become anxious about. And that additional layering, this kernel that we began with, with regards to the emotion, sort of explodes out. And before you know it, you're feeling an emotion that's not only the thing that started, but it's an entire universe away. And this is now the problem, not this.
  Alain De Botton
  Yeah, that's right. And I'm not sure if I understand you fully, but is it really the case that you are not accepting the primary emotion? So let's say you go somewhere, it should be nice, you're disappointed. You can't be disappointed. It's meant to be nice. You can't accept that disappointment. And then you're angry with yourself for feeling disappointed. Whereas if one could just go, okay, maybe it's all right to be disappointed. I mean, it's not brilliant, but there it is. Or I'm feeling sad. Okay, well, that wouldn't be what I wanted, but let me not be sad that I'm sad or angry that I'm sad.
  Chris Williamson
  Well, I think this is why we have certain signature emotions that feel like home base. There's ones that we're intimately familiar with and there's ones that scare us a lot more. And a unsatisfactory but familiar emotion is often more safe to us than a slightly novel, more exotic, but scarier one. And also, I think, happier one. I mean, you know, just a minute ago, people escaping love.
  Alain De Botton
  People also escape happiness. I mean, the way I think about it is that very often we're in a situation of, it's like being a prisoner. You've been kept in jail for a very long time. Your diet's been restricted. It's not been much fun. Then the gate opens and you're allowed to walk out. It should be a great day. Fantastic. You're free. Nah, you know, we know what happens. Let's say you've been on a calorie-restricted diet. Suddenly someone says, you know, here's a buffet. You can eat anything you like. You don't want to eat it. You can't. You can't digest it. You can't process it. It's too much. So, you know, something similar goes on in our attitudes to happiness often. I mean, it's useful to say to yourself, ask yourself, in the circumstance in which I grew up, what did it mean to be happy? And for some of us, it meant upsetting a parent. It meant challenging the dominant mood in a household. It meant taking away attention from somebody else. It meant danger. And that's odd because we think, why would it be dangerous to be happy? Well, but there are all sorts of risks associated with it. And so in our deep minds, sometimes in adulthood, we simply cannot accept the circumstances of our lives and therefore go about spoiling them. So that we put the more, there's a wonderful paper called something like a criminal, a psychotherapy paper, criminal in search of an offense. A sense that you've done something wrong, if you carry that from your past, and then you think, how am I going to get rid of that feeling? Oh, I know, I'll do something wrong. And then I won't feel that feeling anymore. Sometimes, you know, it's a bit like that. It's like saying, I'm feeling happy, but I shouldn't be happy. What should I do? Oh, yes, I'll make myself unhappy. Or, you know, I'm feeling love. Someone's offering me love. That's not normal. I don't recognise that feeling. Oh, what should I do? Oh, I'll drive them away. I'll go and be rude to them or go and have an affair with somebody else or whatever it is, something to spoil something that's nice. So the impulse to spoil is really deep.
  Chris Williamson
  Happiness and love are hard to bear. I suppose if reality is not delivering our model of the world, our expectation of the world, our prediction of the world, we have discordance between the two. And there are two things that we can try and do. We can try and bring our model of the world up to reality, or we can try and bring reality back down to our expectation. Exactly. Beautifully put. Is there a danger of intellectualizing challenges of emotion for smart people? People that like to read and consume YouTube channels like yours or podcasts like mine and we like to investigate ourselves we want to understand ourselves and the world around us and Maybe we've even got the theory from evolutionary psychology that explains why this is adaptive and and ancestrally we are made up of blah blah blah. How much is that a prophylactic against us actually having to feel things and how can we better break through this intellectualizing of emotions and rationalizing of them away? Let's start with compassion.
  Alain De Botton
  We are the way we are for poignant reasons. We didn't get to be that way. Think of the bookish know, think of the child who's reading a lot. Often it's because life around is quite difficult. Now, it's great to read, it's good to read, et cetera. But if you spend all your time in books, that's often a sign things are challenging. And so often people who excel at intellectual pursuits, et cetera, in flight from an overwhelming situation. I'd wish them well. That in time, the overwhelming situation could get a little less intense and they could get a little more of reality into their ([Time 0:22:39](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fb3bf92a-5ee7-49c0-ba8d-21ec1475a1f0))
- **Investigating Emotions and Experiences**
  * Eastern philosophy encourages deep meditation on seemingly simple things to uncover deeper meaning.
  * Western culture often rushes past experiences without fully exploring them.
  * Our minds capture vast amounts of detail, but we rarely access it.
  * 'Proustian moments' triggered by sensory experiences can unlock memories and enrich our understanding.
  * Therapy offers a valuable way to investigate emotions and understand their origins, going beyond coping mechanisms like meditation. It’s not about dealing with but moving past emotions.
  Transcript:
  Alain De Botton
  Let's go back to the Eastern Enzo circle, right? And the East says, meditate for hours repeatedly on the thing that looks obvious, the thing that you know. So they're saying, the whole of life is that circle. So look at that circle and keep coming back to it. And the more you look at it, the more you will see in it. Now, the Western approach is too impatient. It'll say, all right, yeah, it was tense with my dad. I know that. And I'll go, hang on, hang on, hang on. That's an Enzo of its own. It was tense with my dad. You could meditate around that for an hour a day or an hour a week or whatever it is. You can keep coming back to that. There are so many things still to be discovered there. It's not dead. And so I think I'd almost want to excite those who are listening to think, okay, I think I know something. Do I really know it? Might I go back there? Our real experiences tend to be so much richer than our workaday sense of them. Think about a holiday, right? So have you ever been to Greece? Oh yeah, I went to Greece. Oh, have you been to Santorini? Yeah, I've been to santorini okay so so we think we covered that one the person's been to santorini hang on first of all our minds are amazing mechanisms of capture you know we've got cameras Around sound equipment etc nothing beats the human mind for capturing absolutely everything um often the time to explore this is sort of twilight of your mind as you're going to sleep Or waking up. If you say to yourself, yeah, Santorini, what was that like? What was it really like? And you realize, oh my God, I remember there was a tiled hallway that led to a blue door. And I actually remember there was a flower in a little vase, and there was light coming in from, I think it must have been from the left. And actually, if I looked to the right, there was a little window, et cetera. And it's all there. It's all in your mind. Just waiting to be asked. Waiting. This is the famous, can I talk about Proust? Marcel Proust, great French novelist, early 20th century, et cetera, came up with this famous idea of the Proustian moment. Some of you will know it, some of you won't. It's basically a moment when you take something sensory, like a sip of water or a smell. Imagine the smell of concrete after rain or the smell of snow just after a snowfall, etc. And suddenly you get that sensory experience and a world opens up. You think, oh my God, I'm five years old again. And I've just gone outside of the garden of the yard where I grew up and there was a brick wall and there was that exact smell and I'm there again. And suddenly your world becomes so much richer. And these are just little moments of expansion around a topic like after a snowfall or first day of spring or Santorini or whatever it is. So in other words, many of the things that are in our minds in intellectually compressed forms can be expanded with the addition of, I mean, the sort of fancy, trendy modern word is meditation. But some people don't get on with the word meditation. Let's just say by giving it some time, by allowing an experience to assume its proper shape. And we do rush past our experiences. Things are very compressed. And that's why at the end of an average day, my goodness, how much we've seen, how much we felt, how many little things, cross-consciousness. If we were able to give some of that space, how much lighter we would start to feel. But we live so much and we experience so little. We see so much and we notice so little.
  Chris Williamson
  What would you say to obsessive person who wants to learn to let go a little more? A lot of what I see in the circles that I move in is a need for control, a desire to limit down the potential paths that the future could go down to sort of constrain how unpredictable reality Could be. I think the optimization life hacking productivity world is very much a part of this plus a denial of death if i can fit more life into less time then maybe it's kind of living longer yeah Um but yeah that that need to control that obsessive sort of uh requirement to be able to wrangle reality as you wish. Can people learn to take their hands off the wheel a little bit more easily?
  Alain De Botton
  Well, I think the simple answer is that these people are running away from something which is painful and difficult, et cetera, and they're not allowing themselves to think about it. They're not even allowing it inside consciousness. So think of mania. When we say so-and is in a manic mood, or so-and is doing something manically, what we really mean is that they're doing something in order not to do something else, normally not think About something or feel something. And we all end up in certain points in manic states where we're scrubbing the kitchen just a little bit too assiduously, or we're jogging a bit too hard, or we're scrolling our phones A bit too much. And really the question to ask ourselves at that time is a very simple one, which is, if you weren't able to do what you're doing now, what might you need to think about or to feel? And the answer is there waiting for you, if you can bear. It could be a very, very awkward question to ask yourself. In other words, if you weren't able to clean the kitchen manically or without jogging, et cetera, but you just sit with something, what do you need to sit with? The old saying, don't just sit there, do something. Don't just sit there and think, do something. Well, imagine, don't just do something. Sit there and think. Reverse it. You reverse it. And what is it that you need to think about? Yeah. Yeah.
  Chris Williamson
  The coping mechanisms that we have and the inventive ways that we come up with alchemizing and justifying. Well, a lot of the time people will say it's better to be addicted to the gym than be addicted to drugs. I don't think that's a particularly controversial statement. If that's the binary choice. Yes, of course. But then I realized recently, but maybe over the last year or so, I spent a lot of time meditating toward the end of my 20s and trying to turn myself out of the adult infant into maybe an adult Adolescent. And most people would look at meditation, you know, sort of an emotion arises inside of you, you notice it, you release and allow. Like that's, you know, a common sort of tempo that you have. Brilliant. You know, you are no longer as at the mercy of this particular emotion. But it was only when I started doing therapy, as first ever suggested by Charlotte, one of your ex-staff from your school of life.

- **Rituals and Repetition for Personal Growth**
  - Regularly revisit core principles and practices to reinforce their emotional impact, much like religions use rituals and repetition.
  - Avoid the trap of assuming one-time exposure to personal development concepts equals mastery.
  - Re-reading books, reviewing notes, and consistently applying learned tools are crucial for lasting change.
  - The most persistent challenges often require revisiting fundamental principles, not seeking novel solutions.
  - Acknowledge the absurdity of self and approach personal growth with a sense of humor, even when facing recurring struggles.

  Yeah, your attachment strap has piped up and said, notice you're a little bit stressed at the moment. This might be because of X, Y, and Z.
  Alain De Botton
  And, you know, it sounds supernatural and strange. And you know a lot of people will say things like oh it's not you know i don't want to give my data blah blah okay i grant all of that and you know it could be spooky etc it's no different from Think of people who got there first were religions religions understood that if you want to keep people on track you've got to get them repeating stuff it's not enough to tell someone Something once. You need rituals, systems of memorializing the important things. That's why if you're an Islam, if you're Muslim, you'll be praying multiple times a day. You'll be saying the same words because those words have, as it were, been forgotten. Not intellectually, but emotionally. Their full resonance has been forgotten. In Judaism, you're reading the Torah every Saturday. In synagogue, you're reading the Torah and you just go back over it. You don't just read it once. You keep reading. You keep going back to the same important text. We're very bad at that in the modern world. We think, oh, well, I read this book on attachment. It was quite interesting. And now that's it. I know it now. No, you don't. You need to go back. You need to read it all the time. That's why the idea of nudging is not as strange as it might sound, not as futuristic. It's a very old idea that you might give new life to.
  Chris Williamson
  One of the most shameful or humbling realizations of going down a personal development journey for a while is that the tool that you're looking for to the problem you're encountering Now is not only something that you know. It's one of the first things that you ever discovered when you began this journey. It's maybe something you wrote about. It's maybe something that you practiced for a very long time. And I often get asked, I was doing these live events recently, and one of the most common questions is, what advice would you give yourself 10 years ago? The interesting thing about that question, I think, is that the answer that you give, what you would tell yourself 10 years ago, is almost always invariably the answer that you right Now need to hear as well. Because the big problems remain the big problems, because they're so fundamental to who you are. If they weren't fundamental to who you are, they would probably not be the big problems. You were able to detox that it's it's the ancillary stuff it's the extraneous outsides that you end up tinkering with but the core you know the the middle of the cake is this chocolate Is it strawberry uh that's really where it is and um yes to think not only is this challenge that I'm encountering, you know, to break the fourth wall, I've used a number of videos from The school of life over the last decade when I've encountered the same situations. Not only have I watched this, there's been periods where I've learned entire passages from this as a little mantra that I can reflect on. I go, I'm going back to the same, but you're right, this temptation novel, new. There is a better answer. We're five years hence. There must be something that's come out in the last however long. I guess this is what art and heritage, history does that it helps to sort of strip that away yeah what's stood the test of time what's been sufficiently lindy that it's still with us now
  Alain De Botton
  Yeah you know it's tsl is in the four quartets is you know we return to the place where we started it's the idea of that that's kind of part of every journey as you come back to the place where You start the entire story of the alchemist by pa Coelho, right? Right. Exactly. And so I noticed also when you were speaking just now, you have a smile on your lips. And that's not coincidental. I think the more one journeys through life, the more there's really only one major solution, which is a smile on one's lips at the sheer, let's put it bluntly, idiocy. Absurdity. Absurdity of oneself. At the School of Life, we did a class on confidence and we wrote a little book about confidence. Great book. Thank you. And I remember sitting with my co-author, a great friend of mine called John Armstrong. And I said to John, because we started the topic, she's like, okay, what makes us confident? And we'd read a few books, each of us, on best-selling books. And they were saying things like, repeat yourself, how great you are, repeat yourself, your potential, get in touch with what's going on. And I said, I've read all these books, and I'm starting to feel humiliated. I know that it's kind of wise, but I don't know.

- **The Golden Hammer & Intellectual Loneliness**
  * Chris introduces the 'golden hammer' concept: an intellectual, popularizing a concept, applies it to everything.
  * Alain agrees, relating it to how people react to new ideas like Marxism or Freudianism, thinking they explain everything.
  * Chris notes how this limits our thinking, as we look for one answer to the complex world.
  * They discuss how this quest for simplicity manifests in following influential figures.
  * Alain adds we're always left unfinished in exploration of ideas, and more sadly, ourselves. Were always working on something then we die and we need to accept that means we leave parts of life unfinished. Hedonic treadmill. 
  * The conversation shifts to how deep thinkers, with specific interests, can feel lonely as fewer people share those interests.
  Transcript:
  Chris Williamson
  My friend Gwinda has this idea called the golden hammer. When someone, usually an intellectual who has gained a cultish following for popularizing a concept becomes so drunk with power he thinks he can apply that concept to everything exactly Uh exactly we think it's the yeah the hammer that you know the one size fits all yeah and this is everything looks like a nail that slots into your very specific very fancy gilded yeah uh
  Alain De Botton
  Piece of work yeah look but you know we can forgive it it. It's very exciting when you come across an idea that you think and does explain a lot of the world. I mean, this is what happens when people discover Marxism. They think, oh my goodness, this model explains everything. And then, no, it's really good to explain certain things. And then they discover Freud. They think, Freudianism, it explains everything. No, go steady. We need multiple tools.
  Chris Williamson
  I wonder whether this helps to constrain some of the complexity of the world as well. But if I have one book, if it's meditations or if it's If it's some ancient Chinese text, if we're looking at some Lao Tzu or something, and you think, well, that one thing answers everything. I don't need to look elsewhere. Yes. And the problem is that we're finite creatures surrounded by infinite complexity. So the battlefield is stacked somewhat. The deck is offset against our favor. And if we can constrain down the complexity that we're fighting with, we say, well, we've got this one person and he's got all of the answers. One guy has all of the answers. I don't necessarily- Sure. And we see it in religion, we see it in politics.
  Alain De Botton
  One person has got everything. And it can't be true. But you're right. I mean, we're drowning in inputs and that leads us to a certain kind of remorseless quest for the one input. And I remember there was a line saying something like, all of us are going to die with a book half read on our bedside. That may not literally be true, but there's capturing something important there, that our exploration will be unfinished. It's quite daunting. It's a very sad thought, you know, that we won't. And of course, the book that we really won't have finished reading is the book of ourselves. We won't have understood more than a share of ourselves. That's very frightening. We'll have, you know, on an average gravestone, it should say, you know, know, here lies, you know, who half understood who they were. They only half understood. That's very weird. Like you have, you know, you're on your deathbed and you don't really know who you have been.
  Chris Williamson
  Was it Goethe on his deathbed pronounced, uh, nobody really knows me. I don't really know anybody else. Nobody knows anyone really. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
  Alain De Botton
  So that kind of despair.
  Chris Williamson
  Surrounded by friends and family. What a way to cut and call. See you later on. Yeah. Exactly. Speaking on that, do you think it's inevitable for deep thinkers to be more lonely? Is the deep or sensitive thinker kind of fated to have a bit of distance?
  Alain De Botton
  You know, it's a ticklish topic, isn't it? Because to say, you know, I'm not doing so well in life. I'm a bit isolated from things because I'm so marvellous. You know, you could go, come on, you know. However, let's face it, you know, look, it's like, imagine you had a very sophisticated diet and you walk through, you know, we're in London now, you walk through every street of London, There would be fewer restaurants and eating places and supermarkets that you could go into to get the food that you need because your dietary needs will be quite complicated. There's a version of this around sociability. If you only need to talk about certain things, you know, if you are, I don't know, let's imagine you're Brian Cox. I don't know Brian Cox personally. And you really just really love interplanetary phenomena. You're not going to meet that many people who will really be able to meet you on those topics. I mean, or even be that interesting. Go, oh, Brian, I loved your show. Enough with the black holes, mate. Enough with the black holes. And so he might find himself a little bit lonely. I mean, who knows about his life? I'm sure he's, you know. He used to be a rock star. You know that? Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Very cool. Or imagine if you are, I don't know, imagine if you were Freud. And Freud was, you know, he had some collaborators, but he also fell out with a lot of them and didn't get on with, you know, lots of people. So one might argue that complexity of mind militates against easily finding... Fewer people like you. You're going to have to work harder in order to. I would say that's fair enough. Yeah. That's fair enough. ([Time 1:34:16](https://share.snipd.com/snip/cee0108f-4fe6-424e-9054-c3c0906b9ea6))
- **Become a Genius**
  * Pay more attention to your own neglected thoughts and feelings. 
  * Recognize that geniuses and artists often amplify common experiences, not generate entirely new ones. Trust your own opinions and judgements

  Alain De Botton
  I think it's really important to think that the deep thinker, the earnest person, etc., I don't want to suggest that there are these people called geniuses wandering around the world, And they're so different from everybody else. I love this quote from Emerson, where he says, in the minds of geniuses, we find our own neglected thoughts. So key. In the minds of geniuses, we find our own neglected thoughts. I think what he was saying there was, geniuses don't have thoughts that are categorically different from the ones everybody has. What's different is they hold onto them. They look at them. They feel them. You could say, in the minds of artists lie feelings that lie our own neglected feelings. In other words, artists, Jesus, et cetera, they're just paying more attention to the stuff that's in everybody's mind. It's not that their stuff in their mind is completely radically different, which is why often when you hear a great song or a great piece of poetry or whatever, or read a great book, sometimes You think, I kind of knew that that was already in me, that I'm merely being put back in touch with something that's in me already. Because what the so-called clever person has done is just pay more attention. So let's not deify these people. And let's also open up, quickest way to become a genius, pay more attention to your own neglected thoughts.

  I'm interested, you know, having followed your work for a very, very long time, and it's been one of the most reliably influential things, I think, on my intellectual journey. So I want to thank you for parasocially guiding me through an awful lot of situations. ([Time 1:39:39](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0ab2fd78-5720-4c30-9cd3-6678353946f4))
