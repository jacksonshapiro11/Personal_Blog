- Summary: The article discusses a study on muscle-building through resistance training, focusing on the impact of sets on muscle growth. The research found that increasing the number of sets led to greater muscle gain, especially for those initially classified as non-responders to resistance training. While more sets benefited muscle size, strength gains, as measured by one-rep max, did not significantly differ between one set and four sets, highlighting the complexities of muscle development. The study suggests that individual responses to training vary, emphasizing the need for personalized approaches in strength training to achieve desired outcomes.

### Highlights

- This may seem painfully obvious, but the same isn’t true for strength as measured by one-rep max. Doing four reps didn’t produce notably bigger strength gains than one set, which seems both surprising and unfair. This result is consistent with previous studies, though; in fact, [I wrote about a study from Brad Schoenfeld’s group back in 2018](https://www.outsideonline.com/health/training-performance/new-research-can-help-you-decide-how-much-lift/) that found exactly the same thing in young experienced lifters: five sets was better than three sets, which in turn was better than one set for muscle size; but all three options were basically the same for bench press strength. Strength is a function of muscle size *and* of the complex signaling process between brain and muscle. The two don’t always go hand in hand.
  In fact, there are more nuances in the individual (rather than average) data from Roschel’s study. Among those who responded to one set, only 51 percent got significantly bigger muscle-size results from four sets, and 15 percent actually did *worse* on four sets. Normally when I see results like that, I’d assume that those 15 percent had some other life stress going on during the four-set part of the study that tanked their results. But in this case, the one-set and four-set parts of the study were taking place simultaneously in different legs. That suggests that, while four sets are better than one for some people, they really are worse for others.
  So the superficial takeaway from this study is that you can get away with fairly minimal one-set training if your main goal is to get stronger, but you’ll probably benefit from more sets if—like many aging athletes—you’re more concerned with gaining or simply maintaining muscle mass. That echoes the earlier results from Schoenfeld and others. The deeper and more interesting takeaway, though, is that this rule isn’t true for everyone. The resulting uncertainty is inconvenient and a bit annoying, but it means we have to fall back on a simpler rule: if what you’re doing isn’t working, even if it follows the latest research, try changing it.
