- Document Note: categorical imperative when there is one action that is always right in a situation.  People are never means but always ends 
- Summary: Immanuel Kant, known for his strict routine and profound impact on modern history, developed a moral philosophy that emphasized the importance of rationality and consciousness in human behavior. Kant's rule, summarized as treating humanity as an end and never just as a means, underpins his ethical principles. This rule extends to various aspects of life, from laziness to addiction and people-pleasing, urging individuals to act in ways that respect the rationality and dignity of themselves and others. Kant's philosophy challenges common sense morality and continues to be studied and debated in academic circles today.

### Highlights

- Kant  intuitively understood that there is a fundamental   link between our respect for ourselves and our  respect for the world the way we interact with   our own psyche is the template which we apply to  our interactions with others and little progress   can be made with others until we've made progress  with ourselves he would likely be disgusted with   the self-esteem movement today seeing it as just  another way of treating people as a means to some  
  end of feeling better self-respect isn't about  feeling better self-respect is about knowing   your own value knowing that every human no matter  who they are deserves basic rights and dignities   that every Consciousness is sacred and must be  treated as such Kant would argue that telling   ourselves that we are worthless and shitty is  just as wrong as telling others that they are   worthless and shitty lying to ourselves is just as  unethical as lying to others harming ourselves is   just as repugnant as harming others self-love  and self-care are therefore not something you  
  learn about or practice they are something you are  ethically called on to cultivate within yourself   even if they are all you have left the impact  of kant's philosophy Khan's philosophy if you   dive into it is riddled with inconsistencies  and issues but the power of His original ideas   is undoubtedly changed the world and strangely  when I came across them a year ago they changed   me I had spent most of my 20s pursuing many of  the items on the list above but I pursued them  
  for practical and transactional reasons I pursued  them as a means because I thought that they would   make my life better meanwhile the more I worked  at it the emptier I felt ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrn6vv2kd7exj7e92bwtgvp0))
    - **Note:** The duty of self respect is key and starts with knowing your value once you can be honest with yourself you can be honest with the world and once you know what you deserve you will accept what you deserve and use self improvement to strive for more every human understands and deserves dignity. every consciousness is sacred self love and care are ethical musts. Our self respect graphs on to our respect for others. self respect isn't about feeling good but about doing the right thing. What you do doesnt matter as much as the purpose behind doing it and until you find the right purpose you havent found much of anything develop character inspire by ends not means
