  Speaker 1
  Partners. Freddy Gurssel encouraged us in our weightlifting, but he also told us that we also had to train our minds as much as our bodies. He told us that an injury could end our athletic careers, but no one could ever take our minds. So we better be curious and hungry to always learn that has stuck with me throughout my life. Few years later, after winning Mr. Universe, I was lucky enough to train with my first idol, Rich Park. I spent the whole time asking him questions. I wanted to know exactly how he trained his calves. Was there something special about training early in the morning? How did he transition into movies? I absorbed everything like a sponge. Throughout my life, my curiosity and my hunger served me well. It brought me into insane positions I never imagined. Standing with Nelson Mandela in his old jail cell in South Africa, asking him how he forgave his oppressors, sitting in Moscow with Gorbachev, asking him how he got to the top of the Soviet system, and then had the courage to admit it needed to be dismantled. Hanging out at Camp David with President George H.W. Bush, asking him how he brought people from all walks of life to work together, and so many more, from famous directors and actors to popes and world leaders, since I've met every president of the United States since I moved here except for Lyndon Johnson, Daniel jokes that I'm the real life forest gump. It's funny, but the reason I've been this lucky is not pure fortune. I believe it's also because I always remember Freddy's lesson. I'm hungry to learn, I'm curious, and I spend more time asking questions than I do talking. You know, the old saying that God gave us two ears and one mouth for a reason, so we should listen twice as much as we talk. I believe it 100%. This doesn't just go for people who are my idols. Even on movie sets, I enjoy sitting with different members of the crew at lunch and learning about their jobs. I want to understand people and what they do. If I didn't do that, I wouldn't know that there is someone whose only job is dealing with all of the trash and recycling that movies produce. It's fascinating, and a lot of the things that people just take for granted are worth learning about. It makes life more interesting the more you make an effort to understand everyone. People can tell when you're interested in them, and they love that no matter who they are and what they do. So if you struggle to find mentors, my advice is to open your mind and get curious.
