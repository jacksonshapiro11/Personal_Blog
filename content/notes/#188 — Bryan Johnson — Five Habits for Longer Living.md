- Making Decisions for a Better Life
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  That moment he's please others Daniel and he wants to be a different version that led him in his life so I do the same approach I break myself out into different persons and I decide which Versions of me have authorization and win because you know like who who's in charge 10 p.m.u. Who sets the alarm for 6 a.m. Or 6 a.m.u. Who wants a few more minutes with this news button and so you need to make those decisions on who is in charge because if you just let it roll out you know that the present you is always going To win and always get what they want at the expense of other versions of you that have your better interests at heart and then the third is once you get to the the structural where you have A goal and you separate yourself out you know who's making decisions to win then you can do these hyper focused things on behavioral change like you can pair a habit so every time you see A given thing you do a certain action and so that's really in my estimation how I try to stack my life where I basically I've tried to build a life where I make zero decisions of doing things I don't really want to do and I've almost got it like I mean it's actually I'm surprised I've gotten this close to achieving it I just don't behave in ways that I regret anymore and that's
  Speaker 2
  Phenomenal because I was just like walking regret before what I love about you is that you're living life on your own terms and you're not hurting anybody and yet what you're doing is So outside of what we consider normal that you get so much hate and vitriol how do you handle that I love it I have such a positive relationship with a hate it energizes me I am endlessly
  Speaker 1
  Amused by it I think it's just fun to engage with and you know I depression was a much better troll than anyone online you know like my depression could eat me up pretty efficiently get New the zingers and the dunks everyone else you know like it's just play for me I guess like you know like you you can think about these two phases like okay phase one is like do something That is unrecognizable in your time and place okay so we've seen this throughout history phase two is people come with pitchforks like we know this phase three is you've got to survive A whole bunch of attacks you know like the powers of b you're gonna want to start taking you down and then phase if you get past phase two and phase three you get to open up a little bit and You kind of have some open horizon and so that's where I'm at now is I've survived the the major dunk you know where people try to cancel me in society I've survived several attempts at Takedowns and now I'm still at it and so I'm really happy I'm on stage four now and now it's just opening up into a bigger gameplay yeah I was amazed at some of the the stuff that I read online
  Speaker 2
