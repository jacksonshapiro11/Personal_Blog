### Highlights

- Take any emotion – love for a woman, or grief for a loved one, or what I’m going through, fear, and pain from a deadly illness. If you hold back on the emotions – if you don’t allow yourself to go all the way through them – you can never get to being detached, you’re too busy being afraid. You are afraid of the pain, you afraid of the grief. You’re afraid of the vulnerability that loving entails. But by throwing yourself into these emotions, by allowing yourself to dive, all the way, over your head, you experience them fully and completely. You know what pain is. Do you know what love is. You know what grief is. And only then can you say all right. I have experienced that emotion. I recognize that emotion. Now I need to detach from that emotion for a moment.
- It’s very simple. As you grow, you learn more. If you stay to 22, you’d always be as ignorant as you were 22. Aging is not just a OK, you know. It’s growth. It’s more than a negative they’re going to die, it’s about the positive that you understand you’re going to die, and that you live a better life because of it. Yes, I said, but if aging were valuable, why do people always say oh, if I were young again. You never hear people say, I wish I were 65. He smile. You know what that reflects? Unsatisfied lies. Unfulfilled lives. Lives that haven’t found meeting. Because if you found meaning in your life, 
  You don’t want to go back. You want to go forward. Do you want to see more, do more. You can’t wait until 65. ￼
- Turn on the faucet. Wash yourself with the emotion. It won’t hurt you. It will only help. If you let the fear inside, if you pull it on like a familiar sure, then you can say to yourself all right, it’s just fear, I don’t have to let it control me. I see it for what it is. Same for loneliness: you let go, let the tears flow, feel it completely – but eventually be able to say, all right, that was my moment with loneliness. I’m not afraid of feeling lonely, but now I’m going to put that loneliness aside, and know that there are other emotions in the world, and I’m going to experience them as well.
- Have I told you about the tension of opposites?" he says.
  The tension of opposites?
  "Life is a series of pulls back and forth. You want to do one you are bound to do something else. Something hurts you, yet you know it shouldn't. You take certain things for thing, but granted, even when you know know you granted. should never take anything for "
  A tension of opposites, like a pull on a rubber band. And most of us live somewhere in the middle."
  Sounds like a wrestling match, I say.
  "A wrestling match." He laughs. "Yes, you could describe life that way.
  So which side wins, I ask?
  "Which side wins?"
  He smiles at me, the crinkled eyes, the crooked teeth.
  "Love wins. Love always wins.”
- “You know how I always interpreted that? These were people so hungry for love that they were accepting substitutes. They were embracing material things and expecting a sort of hug back. But it never works. You can't substitute material things for love or for gentleness or for tenderness or for a sense of comradeship.
  "Money is not a substitute for tenderness, and power is not a substitute for tenderness. I can tell you, as I'm sitting here dying, when you most need it, neither money nor power will give you the feeling you're looking for, no matter how much of them you have.
- "Each night, when I go to sleep, I die. And the next morning, when I wake up, I am reborn."
