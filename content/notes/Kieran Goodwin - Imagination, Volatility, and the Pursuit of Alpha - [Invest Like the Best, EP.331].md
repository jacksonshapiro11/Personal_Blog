### Highlights

- Insights from a Distressed Investing Expert During the 2008 Financial Crisis
  Summary:
  Going into 2008, it was way worse than I ever thought it was going to be. We were super confident on our view. That's the period, that 0607 period, when the world of subprime was blowing up and commercial real estate was blowing up. And we were like, how are you going to fund these LBOs?
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Starting into market and seeing it grow up, getting a sense of knowing what every market move, every price that happened, you get a sense of calm, almost. Nothing surprising and understanding the origin. So going into 2008, it was way worse than I ever thought it was going to be. I felt that I was as good as I could be at that time. We had a great team, and I was a king share of the time. And Fran Biondee, who taught me a ton about distressed investing, credit investing, we had two circles. I had this kind of derivative optionality, new product background. He had deep value. The intersection, when those two circles kind of intersected, that sliver, we felt like we had a big advantage that we were seeing the markets from two different angles that most people weren't. That's the period, that 0607 period, when the world of subprime was blowing up and commercial real estate was blowing up, and all these LBOs were like, how are you going to fund these LBOs? And we were really, really sure that they were going to get hung and that there was going to be contagion. We were super confident on our view.

- The Psychology of Sudden Wealth in Hedge Fund Careers
  Summary:
  Overnight successes are 10 years in the making. Most of the time, I would say whether it's private equity or hedge fund. During your 20s, you're kind of learning a craft. And then if you're lucky, you get some insights that maybe are unique. When it all does happen, it can happen really quickly.

  Can you explain the psychology of being very successful in the hedge fund career or profession? What it's like to go from learning something, being new at something, to making a ton of money in a fairly virtual job? Like you're not making a widget, you're sort of like a symbol manipulator, and then all of a sudden you have a lot of money. What is that experience like?
  Speaker 1
  I'm going to use probably a terrible word because my vocabulary isn't as good as yours. It's surreal. It's out of body in a sense. Overnight successes are 10 years in the making. Rarely do you have someone that just steps in on day one. Most of the time, I would say whether it's private equity or hedge fund. During your 20s, you're kind of learning a craft. And then if you're lucky, you get some insights that maybe are unique. There's an assumed narrative out there that you're like, I don't believe in this. Everyone's believing this. I don't think this is true. And the payout, if I'm right, betting against that is massive. And then if you're really lucky, you get in a seat where you have real leverage to be in a situation and then you need it to happen. So there's a confluence event. So there's definitely some luck involved in that. When it all does happen, it can happen really quickly. ([Time 0:23:53](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f8021651-0c10-4606-a6d9-0ceed1ab6b6e))
    - **Note:** Overnight succees is years in the making. In your 20s your grinding for a unique insight and in your 30s maybe you capitalize then you get in the right seat and make it happen. Confluence of factors.
- Finding Alpha: A Discussion on Bankruptcy and Long-Short Equity
  Summary:
  I just think information, right? That was massive alpha over time. I don't really understand how going quarter to quarter, is there any alpha anymore? Going back to Buffett, his big advantage is that he had time and permanence of capital. But being on the edge, there's definitely alpha.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Well, the skeptical is easier. I just think information, right? That was massive alpha over time. So if you think about the stress, there was real alpha in knowing, understanding the process, the bankruptcy, chapter 11, the core proceedings, filings that had to be made, reading those filings. And then there's an osmosis that happens where there's some firms that are really good at it. Some people leave those firms start their own firms. So understanding the process, that alpha gets dissipated. But then like, reorg research comes out, which that's just completely flat in the playing field. So the process of bankruptcy. I mean, yes, there's twists on it and turns on it. And you think about the same thing with long short equity. I don't really understand how going quarter to quarter, is there any alpha anymore? I think there was alpha at some point. I think that informational edge in any market over time, where is there alpha? I do believe there's alpha in time. And I believe there's alpha in the permanence of your capital. Going back to Buffett, his big advantage is that he had time and permanence of capital. I definitely think there's alpha there. I think there's alpha in understanding new technology, whether it's biotech or AI or blockchain. But then you always have to find a new new thing. It doesn't persist. But being on the edge, there's definitely alpha.
  Speaker 2
  If you're advising then, you know, who is put in the hypothetical here, a student, someone that's interested in investing, a pension manager, like whoever, a lot of people invest. Is the right average advice, just put it in a Vanguard fund, do you think? Or should anyone, and if so, who, endeavor to do more than that? ([Time 0:26:45](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a21586cf-69da-4018-85dd-529bc84178f1))
    - **Note:** There is alpha in time and technology but it all withers over time. Alpha is where it’s tough to see or pull off but there are reasonable returns. Returns to grit and differentiation.
- The Relationship Between Emotional Intelligence and Investing
  Summary:
  Some of the investors that I've met don't necessarily have high EQs with respect to relating to others. They're very capable of not being influenced by others, which might not be great for a team. It's hard to tell them all the time that you can either be really, really gifted as giving messages, which is high EQ, or you can like, I don't really care. That's just the way I am. Do you think investing our capital markets careers are something that really talented people should go and do? Yes. definitely exceptions.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  There's definitely exceptions. Some of the investors that I've met that don't necessarily have high EQs with respect to relating to others, they have a sense of calm, where they're very capable of not being influenced by others, which might not be great for a team. They might not give you great feedback, whether Sorrow said his back hurt and he used to sell. They're not afraid to come and sell everything or say no. If they don't have a really good EQ, they've got a strong sense of their independence, which it's hard not to get influenced because you're at an organization and even though it's professional, it don't take it personally, it's business, everyone takes everything a little personally. If you're a PM and you have someone that you work with has done really good work and come with great ideas and I think that idea is stupid. It's hard to tell them all the time that you can either be really, really gifted as giving messages, which is high EQ, or you can like, I don't really care. That's just the way I am.
  Speaker 2
  What do you think of with the current setup, the world of investing our capital markets careers as something that really talented people should go and do? ([Time 0:34:30](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d400f476-8a6a-47d6-92f0-5f4cb1d63011))
    - **Note:** Eq is very important to have but having a strong resolve and belief can be just as important an ability for independent thinking.
- The Impact of AI on Credit: Allocation and Debt Structures in Investing
  Key takeaways:
  - Ability to pay and willingness to pay affect creditworthiness
  - Bad actors in the capital markets have a harder time borrowing money
  - Understanding cashflow is crucial for credit analysis
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  There's ability to pay and willingness to pay. We saw that during the subprime debacle is that if a creditor was like, you have the money and the debtor was like, well, I don't need to pay you because I'm not getting kicked out of the house, the willingness to pay went way down. Even that with institutions, if you're a bad actor in the capital markets, it's harder to borrow money the next time. The companies or entities that pay back and are fair, they're more credit worthy. I guess it goes a little beyond numbers in a sense.
  Speaker 2
  If you were teaching a college course or maybe a graduate level course on credit investing specifically, what would be the most major sections that you think would be teachable and important to learn for someone that wanted to do that style of investing?
  Speaker 1
  The best credit analyst that I've seen really understand cashflow and can raise a flag like, wait, this doesn't make sense. Why doesn't EBITDA and cashflow tie out? Why is this explanation taking 17 different footnotes to follow? Why do I have to go around and amaze to see where the numbers are? I think accounting is really, really important. Then I think it's about optionality, which I think I'm very good at, is understanding optionality in the sense that asset values change over time. You have a capital structure today. You have a company that has $100 million of EBITDA and the market says it's worth 10 times and that's a billion dollar company. Some private credit firm will lend you five times. ([Time 0:37:12](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2935ab8d-62fd-4e50-8092-f5e5749e9a8d))
    - **Note:** Best credit investors understand cash flow well can can simplify it. Then understand optionality. Is 15% margins sustainable vs 80% margin that’s unsustainable you need to know how you’ll get fucked.
- Exploring Assumed Narratives in the Financial Landscape
  Key takeaways:
  - Exploring and questioning assumed narratives can help stretch one's imagination and understanding of the world.
  - There are many assumed narratives in the financial landscape that should be examined and understood.
  - Even AAA ratings and mutual funds may not be as safe as assumed, which can be scary for investors.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Is there anything you ever did to stretch your own imagination effectively?
  Speaker 1
  What I tried to do is the narrative is becoming more powerful. You've tapped into that just in all your podcasts. But there's assumed narratives that are out everywhere. I think as a society, probably we're getting better at really exploring narratives and being like, is this really what we want as a society? But in the financial landscape, there's so many assumed narratives. So I do think like exploring what does everyone believe and why is that true? Like it's a little Byron Katie that we were talking about before. It's like trying to understand what is the nature of a AAA rating? What does that really mean? It's never going to default. Well, could this possibly ever default? Yeah, yeah, it could. And has AAA's defaulted? Actually, yeah, they have defaulted mutual funds. I never knew that a mutual fund could gate 2008 hedge fund gated. Tons of hedge fund put gates up. Wow, that's kind of scary as an LP. Like they can just put your gate up. Funds are putting gates up now. There's some funds. I never thought about mutual funds putting gates up. But now it like not consumes me. But like, this is going to happen again. ([Time 0:42:29](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5d869a53-d1c9-4045-a32c-91c91b445ec6))
    - **Note:** Volatility is about imagination. Understand the accepted narratives reason what the tail risk could be and understand the entire system. What are the accepted narratives why are they accepted and why could they be wrong. Question base level paradigms/assumptions.
- The Benefits of Short Volatility in Investing
  Summary:
  The key to vol is imagination. So many of the amazing things in life happen outside, maybe the bounds of what we would expect or think are possible. I worked with an options trader and this was talking about listed options. How do you think about incorporating more long volatility exposure just in general?
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I mean, short volatility is positive carry. Honestly, when you say someone wins the lottery, even though a lot of people that win lottery end up spending all the money, if you've been a financial advisor, one of your clients came in and said, I just won a billion dollars, you would be like, well, you should take X percentage of it and put it in T-bills. You have carry T-bills are 90 days, whatever, but like a little bit short volatility that the federal government is going to keep rolling instead. Anytime you're lending money, you're short vol. I mean, it comes back to the nature of if I'm lending money as a private credit fund, as a bank, as an individual, I just don't want the assets to go down of that entity. So I want everything to stay where it is. If I'm lending money and I have 50% loan to value, I have a 50% equity cushion, it can go down a little bit and I'm fine, but I don't want volatility. I don't really care if it goes up. That's the thing, asset volatility, it can go up. All of a sudden, a billion dollar company is worth 2 billion and you've only lent 500 million. Oh, that's great. As a lender, if you had to choose, would you want volatility or no volatility, not knowing which kind of volatility you're going to get upside or downside, you're like, I want no volatility. I don't get benefit of the upside.
  Speaker 2
  How do you think about incorporating long vol in your portfolio or in your life? You said earlier, the key to vol is imagination. So many of the amazing things in life happen outside, maybe the bounds of what we would expect or think are possible. So how do you think about incorporating the concept of more long volatility exposure just in general, both financially and otherwise?
  Speaker 1
  I worked with an options trader and this was talking about listed options. ([Time 0:48:02](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e232fe6f-939a-43c3-a5a5-e18989f8e0a0))
    - **Note:** Go long volatility not short volatility. Once pricing hits past 100-1 the pricing gets inaccurate because there is so much variability. Power of optionslity and positive fail outcomes for risk takers in everything from finance to relationships. Synergies you want to have a balance of styles joker and Murray not Tatum and Brown who are too similar. Need complements leaders and followers.
- Lessons on Private Credit and Competition from Sports
  Key takeaways:
  - Private credit may not benefit from scale
  - Goals can get in the way of sound lending practices
  - Competition in sports inspires growth of coaching staff
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Scale is good. Yeah, scale is good. But when it comes to private credit, I don't know if that's right. I think you might be reaching a bit and justifying lending at top of cycles to, again, companies that don't have the hardest numbers and why are you making this loan? Well, because we need to raise the money to be the number one player or we want these GPs to come to us first, that's where I think goals can get in the way of it.
  Speaker 2
  Have you learned any other interesting lessons from sports is where my mind goes? You best probably more specifically about teamwork or performance from having spent so much time watching and studying sports?
  Speaker 1
  With respect to sports, I think the fact that the competition is always so fierce. I mean, if you think about let's just go, it doesn't matter. I mean, NBA or NFL, the staffing, how come the staffs keep getting bigger and bigger? You watch a NBA game, there's like 15 guys that are coaches now. I think in 1979, the NBA went to like three coaches or something and the NFL is the same literally because it's the game within the game. There is just the little nuance of where do you get the advantage? I mean, remembering Bill Belichick wanted a left-footed punter because the ball spun the opposite way. It's kind of an experiment where everyone is playing by the same rules, same cap, same schedules. How do you get an advantage? That's where I do feel like the best is for his investor management. Those firms never took for granted their lead. And if you see in sports, why were the Pittsburgh Steelers a dominant franchise? Well, they were the first ones to really scout historically black colleges. They crushed it there. Billy Bean, obviously everyone knows, but there's always some alpha that they're mining, it feels like, to get to a better result. Everyone should be 500 in a sense. So I do think, yeah, an investor management, the firms that have always pushed the limits of what makes sense and lets experiment. I think Jeff Bezos was thinking about his analogy saying, hey, you can wait for your fat pitch, but the difference between baseball and business is that in baseball, you can always hit a grand slam. Here, you can hit a 10,000 run. Right. Hell not. Right. Which is imagination and volatility. Yeah. ([Time 0:55:10](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fc8e637a-720a-4f0c-95e4-0ef19e0a7617))
    - **Note:** Find your alpha/ alpha mining. Imagination in volatility. Take nothing for granted and play the game within the game. Mispriced options everywhere
