  He was expected by himself and the people around him to be prime minister 20 25 years before he actually reached that goal. And yet the entire point is that he would not have been ready to take that position if he had gotten it when he wanted. If he had gotten it earlier in life there's a lot of parallels. I think I have a lot of notes Steve Jobs was on my mind the wilderness period. You know when Steve was fired from Apple and then when he comes back and goes on it sets the greatest record in my argument. Greatest record in entrepreneurship history. And Steve would tell you this himself without that 13 years of struggle. He wouldn't have nearly been the leader and the entrepreneur that he was later in his career. Same exact case here for Churchill which we'll talk to a lot about today. He had spent a lifetime preparing for his part. This sentence is one of the most important in the book and important understanding Churchill. The ventures and ordeals of those early years were essential to the making of the man who triumphed in the Second World War. Young Winston's career began with dreams of success that fueled a spectacular political rise but which ended in dramatic failures. Just like Jobs creating an equally spectacular fall just like Jobs. At 40 he was largely written off as a man whose best days were behind him just like Jobs except Jobs. That happened to Jobs when he was 30. As Churchill confessed in old age he had felt so misunderstood in those younger days that he thought that he had become in the eyes of many quote a freak. Always that but much hated and ruled out. Redeeming this is his next mission if you think about how incredible from 40 to 65 this guy persevered through this. Redeeming the promise of his youth became the great challenge of his later life. One thing that you get at a reading a bunch of biographies is you realize that people don't stumble into greatness. That it was the case for Winston Churchill as well. In a conscious and methodical way he set out as a young man to become the hero that he believed his era demanded. He fashioned his career as a grand experiment to prove that he could work his will on his times. Persevering in that approach despite repeated setbacks and often harsh ridicule of those who didn't share his high opinion of himself. The reason if you go back and listen to the last week's podcast the reason you can read that book. The book is excellent but the reading of the book is going to be very different from the podcast that you hear me. That you heard that I made. I wanted to focus on it. I did this intentionally on the fact of this relentless self belief. And this is why I think we're going to come to this a lot today as well. This idea at my career as a grand experiment I feel have a role to play. I can contribute. I can change the world. You have to persevere. In his case he did it for decades in the face of other people telling him stop believing your special Winston. Why are you talking about yourself like this? Why do you think you're you're destined to do great things? Why do you have all this stuff? Why do you have all this self confidence? Fuck these people. In this book and last book there's a bunch of other people around Winston telling him to not be who he was. In the last book and in this book too there's a bunch of examples of people constantly trying to get Winston to not believe in himself. And every time you have Winston refusing to cooperate, refusing to be in their eyes reasonable. Why does that matter? Because it is highly likely that if he gave in to the opinions of other people about himself, Britain would be speaking German today. The choices we make in the actions we pursue make a difference. They matter and they can change the course of history. And this idea that Winston is constantly surrounded by people that don't share his high opinion of him. It's an important thing to point out and to repeat. No one knows you as well as you know you. Therefore your opinion about yourself is greater than all the other opinions of everybody else around you. Winston Churchill's life is a decade after decade after decade example of that extremely important point. Many of his contemporaries accepted that history is quote the biography of great men but whether Churchill belonged among the great was always subject to hot debate. It is no longer a debate. This is my favorite part of reading books about Winston Churchill and why I highly recommend you do as well. He had few doubts about his destiny however. At the heart of this story is an irrepressible spirit. I believe in personality he declared endorsing the notion that the heroics of great leaders not vast movements are impersonal systems shape history. We live in an age of great events and little men he said. And if we are not to become the slaves of our own system it will only be by the bold efforts of originality. By repeated experiment and by the dispassionate consideration of the results of sustained and unflinching thought. Little men let events take their course. I like things to happen and if they don't happen I like to make them happen. Churchill's words will fire you up. This guy was gifted at his mastery of the English language. You see it in his speeches. You see it in his writings. ([Time 0:08:44](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ecd245d1-5600-4a92-b75f-45c403bc8f47))
    - **Note:** At 40 Churchill was seen as someone who wasted his shot and had failed. Redeeming the promise he has from a young age was the adventure of his life. He saw his career as a grand experiment and that he was destined to do great things he got so much hate but had he gave into the opinions of others he could’ve never accomplished anything he had to have supreme belief in himself. No one knows you better than you know you and you need supreme belief because there will always be haters. He believed we were living at a big moment full of little men great men must shape history and we must dare to be original and unflinching in our resolve not to become little men who let the world pass them by. If we are not to become the slaves of our system it’ll only be through bold experiment and originality. Constant unflinching thought and willingness to think hard and dare to be great. Agency he makes things happen doesn’t let them happen. In every age there are great men. Why not you. Man of action and ideas. Unbounded ambition. Napoleon had a fever at the core. Lord Byron was an idol and Churchill wrote 43 books in his life. Exploring the heart of personality.
- The Pressure and Persuasion of Churchill's Speech
  Key takeaways:
  - The movie portrays the pressure faced by those in the government surrounding Winston Churchill and their differing opinions on how to handle the war
  - Churchill's powerful oratory skills were demonstrated in a real-life speech where he managed to convince his audience to fight
  - Churchill's gift for storytelling and persuasive speaking was developed through practice rather than innate talent
  - Churchill's eloquence was so impressive that his wife couldn't tell if he was speaking or reading aloud
  - Churchill spent time polishing his speeches and memorizing them, often practicing in front of a mirror
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  What I found most interesting about the movie is all the pressure for the people around him in the government. We need a super piece for Hitler, we need a super piece, we need to give up, we can't fight this war, we're not going to win, let's try to bring him to the bargaining table. The movie ends with this speech that happened in real life where half the people were trying to convince him to give up. The other half are with him saying we should fight. He's just a masterful orator and very persuasive speaker. And so what happens is by the end of the speech everybody's on his side. And there's one guy that did not want this to happen, he's sitting in the audience with another guy. And one guy turns to the other guy and goes, what the hell just happened? And his response is perfect. Churchill mobilized the English language and sent it into battle. Steve Jobs said the storyteller is the most powerful person in the world. The most important point here is not that Churchill was born with this gift, he developed it through practice. In fact, Churchill had such a good memory and spoke so eloquently that if his wife was in the next room and she was hearing him speak, she would ask, she could not tell if he was speaking Or reading aloud. Even when he was speaking ex-type marinadesly, the sentence would come out fully formed almost if they were written. And so that's going to be a present fact in any book that you pick up on Churchill. He spent the days leading up to his speech polishing his remarks and committing them to memory. He stood before a mirror pretending he was addressing the house. This became a common method for preparation for him to the annoyance of others nearby. ([Time 0:18:54](https://share.snipd.com/snip/74f55841-8dbd-4a0a-a303-04376794f21c))
    - **Note:** Churchill practiced his public speaking often and developed a strong nack and ability for it. On his famous we will fight from the beaches his rivals said he weaponized the English language. He would practice his speeches constantly. Churchill read everything he could get his hands on his work ethic was famous. Churchill sought out mentors like Neville chamberlains father. Churchill saw him as heading to the top with everything as a stepping stone. All the great houses start with hard bastard and cut throats. He admired Joseph chaimberlin he was a great man but a cut throat. The story of the father is embedded in the son. Churchills dad died early from Syphilis and this experience was seared into Winston’s brain. His dad was a famous statesman who’s ambition was quelled by others and was not as well read but possessed great promise. Winston had all these features but he read like an animal and burst through barriers to be who he was. Him and his dad even died on the same day 70 years apart.

  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  He has this lifelong friendship with a woman that he wanted to marry, and she turned them down. Her name is Pamela, so they wanted to become friends for 60 years, but she gave one of the best descriptions of Churchill. The more I think about it, it's one of the highest compliments that you can actually give up person. If you sit here and think about what she's saying. The first time you meet Winston, you see all of his faults. The rest of your life you spend in discovering his virtues. There's two successful attributes that Churchill has that I think we should try to emulate. One is, they always talk about his energy levels. They say that he never seemed to run out of energy. I'm just going to leave a link down below. There's this excellent video. I think it's 11 minutes long. It's about this guy who sold his company to Steve Jobs a few years before Steve Jobs died, and even when he was sick, knew he had cancer, knew he was dying. Even though Steve was older than him, this is the guy that wind up selling his company to Steve and then going to work in Apple. Even though Steve was older than him and sick, he said that Steve was way higher energy than he was. I'll leave that link down below in the show notes. I highly recommend, I've watched the video, I don't know, probably five, maybe ten times. The story is fascinating. The second trait is the fact that Churchill throughout his life sees things earlier than other people. What I'm about to describe to you is his eight years before World War I. He's observing the German military. He knows that they're a threat. He tries to tell people around them. People don't believe him. They don't agree. There's another great, I covered this book on Churchill. I think it was the first book I ever read on Churchill. It's called The Splendid in the Vile, and it's all about his time as Prime Minister. And there's a great line in the book that goes something like, you may not like Churchill, but he was right on Hitler. He saw Hitler for who he was, way before most of the people around him. This idea that he just sees things earlier than other people. It happens over and over and over again. Remember, this is eight years before World War I. Churchill spent a week observing maneuvers of the German army. It was a chance to take a close look at the military machine that posed the biggest threat to peace in Europe. Though Kaiser Wilhelm insisted, that's the leader of Germany at the time, insisted he didn't want to war with anyone. Yeah, okay, well what's coming out of your mouth and then what are your actions? Always go with people's actions. The Kaiser himself issued the official invitation asking Winston to be his personal guest for the week. Okay, what are you going to do? Churchill followed a mock battle of 50,000 men in the German infantry artillery and cavalry. The regiment was a proud one and took itself seriously as a fighting force. This is Churchill's observation. The Kaiser gave him a special pass to inspect the latest German artillery weapons and invited him to a field conference with his generals. Well, for a guy that says he doesn't want war, he's certainly practicing a lot for it. Kaiser Wilhelm began showing off his knowledge of all the great battles fought over time. His history lesson had a serious point. He was clearly suggesting that blood would be spilled again if any army was unwise enough to attack the Germans. His words reinforced the message. Germany was ready and willing to make war if pushed. So Churchill goes back and he says he gave the Germans credit for security and numbers, quality, discipline and organization. This is Churchill's writing, right? They have security and numbers, quality, discipline and organization. These alone he emphasized were four good roads to victory. You should pay attention to what they're doing. We should prepare now eight years before war breaks out. Third trait is Churchill's force of personality. And it's really interesting because this is described by one of his lovers. It's remarkably consistent. This is Churchill as a young man. It's going to sound a lot like the Churchill, the one that the world came to know and love. Winston discourse on the brevity of human life and his determination to accomplish great things in the short time available. He told her we are all worms, but I do believe that I am a glow worm. More important, she perfectly understood the nature of his talk, that it was essentially Winston thinking aloud. He was highly opinionated, strong-willed, idealistic, romantic, intense, overwhelming and demanding. He possessed a boundless, boundless drive. Churchill had big ideas and he wanted to act on them without delay. He says stuff like this to everyone all the time. Sometimes I feel as if I could lift the whole world on my shoulders. And the reason this is important to repeat is because his internal world, right, his internal monologue is telling him, I'm special, I'm special, I'm special. And then the external world starts to agree with his internal world, telling him that you are special. And you see that at his rapid rise, at 33 years old he was finally taking his place in cabinet and was the youngest to do so in almost half a century. This is so important to understand because then you realize the shock. Imagine if you had this real on the self-belief since time you were seven, they said. When time you were seven, then everything around you rise faster in a younger age, anyway else. You get to 40, you think, okay, this is the next office prime minister and then the exact opposite happens. You get kicked out of government and you think your entire life is over. We're going to get there in a minute. More personality traits that he shares with Steve Jobs. He generated his own light. It was intense, direct, and concentrated as a beam. Another trait that Churchill shares with Steve Jobs is the fact that he raises the bar and pushes the pace for everyone around him. This is going to be Churchill's frenemy, I guess, is the way you would describe it. They're serving together. They're fellow politicians. ([Time 0:34:40](https://share.snipd.com/snip/efaff531-0aba-415c-87b5-87d7c6370fe0))
    - **Note:** Churchill had insane energy when compared to others and saw things much earlier than most in both the start of ww1 and 2. Saw ww1 starting 8 years before it happened. Churchill saw people for what they did not what they said. With Kaiser willhelm he saw him leading military exercises in Europe and knew he was shaping out for war 8 years early. Pay attention to what people are doing and prepare for it. Churchill had a force of personality. He believed strongly in himself big ideas with boundless drive. He was a man with big ideas. He was highly opinionated strong willed idealistic overwhelming romantic intense and demanding boundless drive. Wanted to act on big ideas without delay. He generates his own light. He was preparing to be pm since he was a kid and when he didn’t get there after everyone started to accept he would it was crushing but he didn’t let it get him down. Churchill was intense and he raised the bar of other ambitious people choose your friends and enemies wisely. He made himself very disagreeable. Ambitious people need ambitious peers
- Churchill's Blueprint for Life: Thinking Big, Taking Risks, and Making the Most of Opportunities
  Key takeaways:
  - Ambitious people thrive when surrounded by other ambitious peers
  - Churchill applied his blueprint for life to both his career and personal life
  - Churchill valued family and found happiness in marriage and fatherhood
  - Churchill's aggressive nature had both admirers and detractors
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  They must be around other ambitious people. Let me read you an excerpt from one of Paul Graham's essays. Ambicious people are rare, so if everyone is mixed together randomly as they tend to be early in people's lives, then the ambitious ones won't have many ambitious peers. When you take people like this and put them together with other ambitious people, they bloom like dying plants given water. Probably the most ambitious people are starved for the sort of encouragement that they'd get from ambitious peers, whatever their age. And so Churchill's doing this not only for the people around him, but he's actually trying to change the institution in which he's operating. He tries to do it for the government. And really you can think about this as not as what he's doing as a politician, but this is his blueprint for life. In effect, Churchill was proposing to do for the nation what he had been doing for himself to achieve quick success by thinking big, taking risks, and making the most of opportunities Why they lasted. And then just a few observations that I enjoyed from the human aspect of his life, not just his career. And it's the fact that he did want a family, he wanted love, you see him in this book, struggle, try to find the right woman, he had to find the right woman. He attempts this many times, finally gets it right, gets married, locks out, finds a supportive lifelong spouse, and then becomes a father for the very first time at age 34. And he's writing, there's a bunch of letters that he writes to his wife that are fascinating, but I love this. Like he's happy that he's not single anymore being a father and having a family was very important to him. The bachelor life had been lonelier than Winston had wanted to admit, and now he finally had a companion with whom he could share everything. And so he writes to his wife, I feel a vivid realization of all you are to me, and of the good and comforting influence you've brought into my life. It is a much better life now. And so Churchill's aggressive nature obviously is going to be loved by some people and hated by others. ([Time 0:40:35](https://share.snipd.com/snip/164f94d3-f572-4213-8dce-ada0bc39312b))
    - **Note:** Churchill wanted to do for England what he did for himself take big risks thinking quick and making the most of opportunities. His wife and family was a huge addition to his life. He took awhile to figure it out to make sure he got it right but she was his rock. He took the hard path when he didn’t need his he hated people sho sought comfort and took the easy way out. He hated the idol and lazy. He lived and exhausting and driven life. Even when he was playing he was practicing to be great and for government. He did nothing halfway through only punch worth throwing is a ko punch. Oil ships were better than coal so Churchill basically invented bp because there was no reliable source of oil. Winston was similar to Larry Ellison he wanted to do really hard things because this ensured there was no competition. He wanted to be imaginative and daring on a grand scale when others were content to think small and go slow.
- Winston Churchill's Grand Plans and Relentless Pursuit of Excellence
  Key takeaways:
  - Doing something difficult without competition can lead to success
  - Being a student of history can inspire you to reach farther
  - Churchill played a role in British naval power
  - Churchill had a talent for seeing things years in advance
  - Being realistic can be terrible advice
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And if we can do something really hard, we won't have any competition. It's exactly what Winston is saying here. Winston was willing to make plans on a grand scale and to be imaginative and daring when others were content to think small and go slow. I think the fact that Churchill was a relentless student of history. I think he stumbled upon and discovered something that I think you and I also know if you read a lot of biographies, if you're studying and you're learning from history. It makes you reach farther. It makes you believe that you're capable more than maybe you're doing right now. And we see this as a lifelong student of the country's history, Churchill was allowed to play a role in the epic story of the British naval power. He was following in the steps of giants who had defeated the Spanish Armada in the 16th century and Napoleon's Navy in the 19th. Napoleon's Navy and the 19th, he did not want to be the man who let the royal Navy be overwhelmed by the Germans. And so as I mentioned earlier, Churchill has this talent to be able to see things, usually years in advance of other people. He wants to prepare the Navy, wants to be the world's best Navy, wants more ships. And the cabinet keeps telling, oh, no, you didn't need four battleships. What's wrong with you? You only need to be reasonable. I hate that word. The worst advice I've ever heard is like be realistic. That's terrible advice. So it says, you know, you don't need four more battleships. You know, I think two is going to be enough to, you know, we feel in the cabinet that is more reasonable. ([Time 0:48:49](https://share.snipd.com/snip/71203c61-391c-4651-9456-181fa9873303))
    - **Note:** Churchill didn’t believe in being reasonable and he was a deep student of history which made him even stronger willed in the need to defend brittan from the Germans. He was unreasonable and wouldn’t compromise this lead to him preparing for war when his compatriots thought it was impossible. The British half heartedly threw the country in the war. Pursue your goal vigorously non self aware idiots surround you fight with single hearted conviction. He had skin in the game and went to the front lines to fight as pm. Never underestimate your opponent. He underestimate the Turkish in galipolee and this lead to his first downfall people he thought were his friends abandoned him. He was made a scapegoat for this embarrassment. He was kicked out of government his enemies rejoiced and he waited there in shock for redemption and jobs that wouldn’t come. He had to start his career over at 40. He had to fight or die. His dad had the same issue a huge blow he never recovered from Winston decided to fight from the trenches. He literally left to fight personally in ww1 to directly redeem himself. Not to ge like His dad. He literally went out ready to die.
