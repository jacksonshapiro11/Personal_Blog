### Highlights

- Independent thinker and misfit. Long live imprudence it’s my guardian angel. Constantly questioned accepted wisdom. Because he was such a free thinker he alienated people and it was initially tough for him to get a job because he alienated many people. Despite being very smart. He was child like curious.
  Study people who’s independence of character and judgement define humanity.
  Not a rote genius but succeeded because of his mental strength abs creativity. Imagination is more important than knowledge. Tolerance is the necessary condition for invention. Fostered individualism and curiosity over the group. Sought solitude. Intense focus.
  Persistence and curiosity with independent thinking. Non confirming helped him his entire life but hurt him early.
  Education based on free action and personal responsibility over outward authority. Everyone should have their own personal curriculum.

    - **Note:** Einstein was a very difficult person to work with because he was free spirited non conforming and kinda an asshole. He constantly questioned accepted wisdom took on his own personal curriculum and thought for himself. Relief not on his memory but his creativity his genius made him distant from society. Rote vs mental models is system vs point intelligence
- Einstein didn’t get along with people and it was impossible for him to get a job despite being a genius.
  Exercising your ego is not the way to build an effective organization. Einsteins ego got in the way of him getting a job and this made him very depressed. His dad writes to a professor begging to give his son a job. The professor doesn’t respond but years later is the one who nominated him for a Nobel prize.
  Jocko video - don’t let your ability to get along with other people stop you from your goal
  Einstein by luck got a job at the parent office and while working here he managed to fit his “job” into 2-3 hours so he could focus on his work.

    - **Note:** einstein was highly disagreeable, which made getting a job impossible, but also led him to challenge fundamental assumptions can't have one without the other. People with fall around you when you shape the world like einstein did. He fit his job into 2-3 hours and then worked on what he wanted for the other hours of the day incentive alignment fedex
- Remain critically vigilant question every premise challenge traditional wisdom never except the truth of something just because others view it as obvious Resist incredulous assume everything the inventor says in the patent is wrong. Jeff bezos does this by assuming every sentence is wrong until he proves it right

    - **Note:** Critical approach constantly question and prove our everything.
- Einstein and friends formed the Olympia academy where they got together to discuss different works and ideas. Like the junto. Develop your curriculum.

- His father died when he was still a patent clerk this threw him into a daze of desolation. His father never saw him become more than a patent clerk. The bond you have with your parents.
  Had Einstein retired before his miracle year he would be unknown. What he did in 1904 is similar to what I did needed in 19 1666 when he invented calculus and gravity during a plague.
  Einstein all ideas and idea come suddenly but it’s just the distillation of hours of study and thinking and then at the end it randomly pops to mind. It comes suddenly and intuitively but it’s just the outcome of earlier intellect experience.

    - **Note:** Insight comes after you collect a bunch of knowledge let it stew then have diffusive learning. This was the most productive year ever but his dad never saw him as more than a patent clerk and this hurt Einstein until the end.m
      Insight nature of importance of diffusive learning. If he was never bored at the patent office he never would've invented this stuff.
- To dwell on the things that depress or anger us does not help us. One must knock them down alone.
  Einstein as a teacher scribbled on a card and was developing Ideas during the class showing people his thinking in the class and so for a lazy student who just wanted to regurgitate what the teacher and said he was a bad teacher but for those he wanted to develop ideas and think he was a very good teacher. The lectures force the audience to think along. You can see how he thinks not just the output. So you see a lot of false turns wrong answers and dead ends but the end product is much better. He sought in all directions so most paths are blind alley.
  Einstein hated confinement and was not a good man in relationships.
  Valued the individual and personal and intellectual freedoms.

    - **Note:** Einstein was kinda a dick and really bad at personal relationships because he valued his freedom.
      He believed in conquering your fears alone knocking them down mentally one by one.
      His teaching style was teaching in motion where he would think through and solve the problem with the class which didn’t teach them answers but rather problem solving and how to think. Taught thinking processs.
- Einstein was a loner and wanted to be aloof thinking. This produced a wry detachment for the world from Einstein. He lives almost detached from the human experience he had good friendships and could be a good companion but he never invested his heart in anyone and could be cold to those he loved. He didn’t care what people thought because he was so aloof from society so he easily was non conformist. Man is both a solitary and social being. He hates people conforming.
    - **Tags:** #introvert, #love, #non-consensus-and-right, #emotionally-unavailable, #relationship, #non-conformist-rebels, #einstein, #detached-from-human-experience
    - **Note:** Einstein was an introvert and a loner he had relationships but could never open up or let people inside this led to him being distant from even those he loved. This was bad but made him easily non conformist because he straight up didn’t care what others thought because he didn’t even think about it.
- Einstein realized that assimilation of Jews in Germany was impossible and opening detested hitter and likely almost got killed for it. Assimilation was impossible. He was a militant pacifist until hitter came to power and he changed his tune. Hitter kicked out all the Jewish scientists. This brain drain made Germany unable to develop the bomb and made Einstein think it was imperative. He hated war but realized the nazi threat was too great. You never know how important each moment will be in the future when he left Germany Einstein planned to be back in Europe 6 months a year. He also met Churchill when he was merely a rebel in the opposition party. He never came back to Europe in his final 22 years.

    - **Note:** Einstein realized he had to get out of Germany that hitler had too much power. This decision saved and forever altered his life. This brain drain also may have lost Germany the war. Relative morality he hated war until hitler. Few decisions shape your life he never went back to Europe
- He valued quiet solitude getting away and having time to think. He was famously absent minded.
  He was incredibly dogged. He asked for few things in his office one was a waste basket so he could get rid of his many mistakes.
  Older people need to defend the speech and rights of younger people who cannot take any risks with what they say. Into tested communism and McCarthyism what is legal is not always ethical
  Use for yourself little but give much.

    - **Note:** Valued solitude deep focus and minimalist atmosphere simplicity. Sometimes those in power need to stand up for those without it.
- Einstein on life - brief is this existence a fleeting visit in a strange house The path to be pursued is a fleeting vision from a flickering consciousness. The strange thing about growing old is the attachment to here now as loss and one is disposed into infinity. The difference between past present and future is an illusion.
  He said that he had no special talents only curiosity. Curiosity has its own reasons for being. Beauty and simplicity. He would aim for beauty and simplicity and to him simplicity was beauty.

    - **Note:** All we will ever have is this one moment and the present is it. Our only deep talent is curiosity
