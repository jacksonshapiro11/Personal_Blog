- Spielberg knew he was gonna be a movie maker from 12 and had a deep understanding of the industry where he would reuse scenes from different movies 20 years in the future. He also got equity and 2% of ticket revenue at Universal, which is made him a billionaire , nonlinear returns to genius and owning equity. Knew his passion from a young age terrible student but was a great director at home treating his personal life like a movie and cutting class to edit movies at 16. He wanted to be a director he had no plan b his dad told him to start small and work up but Stephen gunned for the top from day 1. He was obsessed with embracing technology like using cgi for Jurassic park. Singular focus and enthusiasm attracts mentors they saw his passion and enthusiasm and were drawn to it he wanted to learn from others you can change an existing industry. Lucas and Spielberg come into an industry that is stagnating and decides to do it differently reinvent the industry. Make a product for society or people will never find you and you can invent and build your own world. The world is malleable. Disappointed in the world built one of his own.

    - **Note:** He had a deep passion and understanding for the craft and took equity in his business which lead to non-linear returns. Given his passion he didn't care about school his dad told him to start small and scale but he thought big from day one living his life as if he was a director. Embraced technology. His passion and enthusiasm dedication to the craft attracted vital peers and mentors. He made a product for society and built his own world, malleable world. Great work ethic
- Constantly watching and re-watching movies he watches Lawrence of Arabia every year, steel scenes from old movies and ideas, and as a kid, he was always excitable and always around movies trying to learn clear he had a thirst for knowledge. Develops his own personal curriculum does he own professional research. Every film school rejected him so he used a lot of Universal Studios to reach out to and develop his own personal curriculum. The movie brats saw an old declining industry and reformed it themselves doing what others said they couldn’t to create the world they wanted people told them not to break in but they did anyways. Changed the industry that was in decline. Saw Lucas realized he was probably better than he was and was envious but also wanted to learn and collaborate as they were contemporaries. Spielberg’s mentor Chuck got a call from his dad saying Stephen should go to school but Chuck said that Stephen at lightning in a bottle and the opportunities come and go very quickly and that he had to stay on the lot because he could be special having that support from a mentor was important And probably helped propel him. You also gotta c his film class and would randomly ask people on the lot famous actors to grab coffee or lunch many said yes you gotta shoot your shot. Chuck silvers didn’t help Spielberg become who he was but he helped open doors for Stephen to make the most of which is all anyone can do for you.

    - **Note:** You worked with the same people for 20 years over that time he developed a lot of chemistry, which makes everything easier This is a vital skill in building. His first opportunity was TV which she didn’t wanna do, but he had to take his opportunity. Always nervous throwing up before ever seen still at 60. His career stalls multiple times and he has to recover and reinvent. He thought visually and was a good person which gets you far. Positive forward motion regardless of internal suffering. Jaws comes after his biggest failure he didn’t even want to do the movie questing conventional wisdom can be very profitable. He wanted to give up on jaws many times thought it would be a flop went over budget and timing 3 times the shark literally broke people around him helped him see it through with unique problem solving. He thought his career was over and it was the biggest movie ever made. He had bad cost management but used his biggest loss 1941 to raiders of the lost arc where he works with Lucas learned how to manage costs and raised money where he was structured to have upside which was rare. Controlling costs is how he became rich he was very resourceful. When things hit the fan he adjusts the shot to fit the situation. Prioritized family feels pressure but always meets the task. Maintains balance.
