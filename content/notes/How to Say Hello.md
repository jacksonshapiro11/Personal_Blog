### Highlights

- We decide if we like something **somewhere between 1/10th of a second and 7 seconds** ([Janine Willis and Alexander Todorov, 2006](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01750.x)). First impressions have been shown to last for months ([Gunaydin, Selcuk, & Zayas, 2017](http://paclab.psych.cornell.edu/pdf/Gunaydin,Selcuk,&Zayas,PortraitPrediction.pdf)) and can sway one’s point of view **even in the presence of contradictory evidence** (e.g., [Rydell & McConnell, 2006](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5407180_Forming_Implicit_and_Explicit_Attitudes_Toward_Individuals_Social_Group_Association_Cues)), and **even when you can’t recall why** ([McCarthy & Skowronski, 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5172463/#R23); [Todorov & Uleman, 2002](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5172463/#R38)). This is why it matters that you learn how to say hello. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7xrcmgtn1362qnx7qky64rx))

    - **Note:** First impressions are vital to meeting people
- You can uncover something interesting about nearly anyone ***if*** you **converse with curiosity** instead of apathy, greed, mistrust, or resignation. And if you don’t happen to uncover something fascinating about the other person—see this as your fault, not theirs. Why? If you blame others for poor conversations you surrender control and condemn yourself to a lifetime of many miserable, meaningless chats. **But, if you take responsibility for building an interesting conversation,** you’ll learn to adjust what you’re doing so that people will want to have positive interactions with you. Also, people will be more willing to share with you their most interesting ideas if you demonstrate that you can be trusted to handle them with care. This takes effort but makes life more vivid. Author Chuck Palahniuk meets people by the hundreds—sometimes for eight hours straight—at his book signings. He [offers this advice](https://www.amazon.com/Consider-This-Moments-Everything-Different/dp/1538717956) on how to do it well: he attempts to treat each person as if they were the only person he would meet that day.

    - **Note:** converse with curiosity everything is magic. First impressions are vital. Get curious and actually care about someone
- If someone asks you “what do you do?” resist the temptation to respond with your job title. Instead, **respond with an “I believe” statement.** Example: 
  *“So, Jim, What do you do?” 
  “ I believe story, art, and design can bend the arc of humanity’s progress, and I try to bring that into everything I do: from movies to startups to paintings to books and to ballets.” 
  *A statement of belief will start more interesting conversations than your job title. If the person doesn’t immediately ask a question in return, you can *ask them* *what they believe*. Compare this to the usual path: if you open with your job title or rank, this sets up a confrontational hierarchy. And if you introduce yourself with something vague, like “finance” or “tech” or “science” or “art” this sends a signal that you don’t really want to talk about it. **Open with an idea**, and the conversation is already interesting before it begins. We crave interestingness over almost all else. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7xrw4hdz18t54cd5sfkvkex))
    - **Note:** answer what questions with why's always provide an I believe answer instead of just a simple shift response
