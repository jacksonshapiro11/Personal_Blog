  Competitor that was built with AI inside it for identifying action items and all that stuff based on what people were saying in the call and would produce meeting notes afterwards and it was incredibly would produce a highlight to real up the conversation so you could zoom into the exact specific moments that mattered etc it sounds cool the problem is now wants to pay for that on top of your hanging out on top of zoom full stop but the product if you saw the product today but like that's insanely brilliant it's awesome it looks great it works great I've used it many times etc but if you try and take it to a company and say will you pay seven dollars ahead for this on top of your zoom fees and you're already probably buying the g-suit anyway the answer just basically says no so that's One thing that I've just become a more wise to which is and it sounds so stupidly obvious when I say it like that but the route to market times day users propensity put their hand in their pocket is a real thing in those cases zoom already has the route to market and g-suite has already there with their pseudo monopoly on all things productivity inside a company another change i've just been trying to distill of late has been in i find myself asking startups the same question a lot lately which is what is the single thing you can say that is unique to you valuable to your user true and simple and all four things matter and most people fail on one of the four it's either too complicated a pitch or other people can say it or your users don't give a shit or it's Not true and that has been a really impressive and I often say this if it's a Miranda company I barely know or a lighter week intro I often say it as a prequel of art actually bothering to take a call or even sometimes reading a pitch deck and that's a maturity that I didn't have I would have heard the pitch five years ago and gotten really caught up in how nice the product looked and all that whereas now I find if you fail I thought heard the chances of you being a really successful business the outsized outcome that makes angel investing makes sense is pretty slim and then the third one I just continue to beat a drum about is just execution and I won't say too much about it because I know you agree if your idea is any good you should assume it'll Become commonplace and everyone will have that idea because they're going to see your version of it and then everyone's going to try and do it and if someone does a lot better than you or can do it the same as you but faster you're going to lose but won't be close you will definitely lose first really doesn't mean a whole lot unless you helps you build a bit of a brand maybe but you'll get outpaced pretty quickly once somebody has a feature you don't so I care a lot about due to fenders get that and if the founding team isn't super technical you guys in they can't design build execute your own software then I always worry about that because they often don't how did an intercom itself solve that execution problem because I think relatively early on people realized oh yeah this is a ([Time 0:45:51](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9874a8e3-fb24-4217-9e75-ba6dbcbc43fc))
    - **Note:** Core of a good product. Does the product actually solve a problem or is it just cool. Make your product very tough to copy. You need to build interoperability make your product so good it becomes the default. First great product then great brand then wins hearts and minds. With a start up it’s bad to beat your head on something without clear product market fit. Measure the ROI of your time don’t waste your life doing something low leverage and agency. Would you value this compounded time in the future. Inside every 80 year old is an 8 year old wondering wtf happened.
