### Highlights

- Building a Championship Team: A Comparison Between the Pirates and Red Sox
  Summary:
  ZoomInfo CEO: Not everybody is cut out for a championship team. He says the Pittsburgh Pirates never show up expecting to be in the title hunt. The Boston Red Sox, on the other hand, are focused on building a championship team every year and they're always in the hunt for a title.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  The gist of the message was we're building a championship team here at ZoomInfo. Not everybody is cut out for a championship team. I use the analogy of the Pittsburgh Pirates and compare them to the Boston Red Sox. I said, look, the Pittsburgh Pirates, there are a bunch of major league baseball players on the Pittsburgh Pirates. Every year they show up and they play the game and they're never in the hunt for a championship title. They never show up expecting to be in the hunt for the championship title. They show up. It's a nice place to work. They make pretty good money. They finish the year and they're very mediocre or sub-mediocre. Then there are other teams, like the Boston Red Sox or the Yankees, who every year, year in and year out are focused on building a championship team. They're always in the hunt for a title. Those teams just operate differently. Someone can be really successful on the Pirates and they're never going to make it on the Boston Red Sox. What I told our team is, look, we are building a championship team here. If you look around and you feel like it's hard or it's not for you and you don't want to give the discretionary effort to Zoom info, there are lots of companies that aren't building a championship team. There are lots of Pittsburgh Pirates out there that you could go and have a really comfortable existence at and not feel this everyday drive to be the best to win a championship. Pittsburgh Pirates are good people and you could go work at that company and you won't feel the pressure of what we're trying to build at Zoom info. ([Time 0:04:05](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4dd22761-a36b-4e5b-996d-3262a1cec791))
    - **Note:** Showing up every day being a dog and working hard is important. Some people want to have good jobs and work for the Pittsburg pirates others want to win championships and play for the Yankees. Championship mindset and culture of winning. Zoom info has a constant pressure to improve never rest on laurels.
- Explaining Your Role in a Project: Competence, Reliability, and Motive
  Summary:
  When I'm involved in a project, what I do is I'll explain why I'm there. And it breaks down to three things, competence, reliability, and motive. Your pathway to getting me out of these calls, because I don't want to be here either, is to close the gap on one of those three things, CRM. If the leaders at the organization also drive that level of transparency and communication, then you can drive performance in those organizations.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  One of the things I started doing today is when I'm involved in a project or I'm involved in the execution of something, what I do is I'll explain why I'm there. And I think it breaks down to three things, competence, reliability, and motive. So when I show up and I'm involved in something, I might be involved in a website redesign. And I come in and I'm in those meetings, and then at some point I go, listen, I want to tell you guys why I'm here so that you can get me out of this meeting. And it's one of these three things, CRM, I either think you guys are not competent to actually deliver this. And that's because the last three things you delivered were off here, off there, off here. I might not think you're reliable because we have to hit a deadline on this and the last three things you didn't deliver on time. Or I actually think your motives are wrong, like you actually want a pretty website and I only care about a website that performs really well. So I'm coming here to make sure that all of our motives are aligned. Your pathway to getting me out of these calls, because I don't want to be here either, is to close the gap on one of those three things, CRM. And I think if the leaders at the organization also drive that level of transparency and communication, then you can drive performance in those organizations because you're just constantly aligning to the most important metrics that you're going to track.
  Speaker 2
  Does that mean that your senior most team end up looking like back similes of you to be able to propagate this?
  Speaker 1
  I think mainly, yes, certainly around performance management, yes. I think people on my executive team have different perspectives about things that don't come naturally to me, that are valid perspectives and help the organization run better operationally. But I tie that all back to performance. I'll give you an example. Our chief revenue officer came in and went, listen, we have no golden customer journey at Zoom info. ([Time 0:08:54](https://share.snipd.com/snip/dd1ed144-fa36-4168-a50a-bb39c610bf38))
    - **Note:** Clear about when he is intervening there is a lack of competence reliability or motive then he works to fix that. Pretty intense guy. Understand the whole system and customer journey.
- Using cognitive testing for hiring at startups
  Key takeaways:
  - Using cognitive tests can be a valuable tool for screening potential hires
  - The best performing account executives at a startup had the highest cognitive scores on tests
  - This method was effective until the company reached 1000 employees
  - Different criteria became more important as the company grew
  - Startups require employees to be adaptable and figure things out independently
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And is that like a test that we could use for future hiring? Ultimately, we found that at the startup stage, the best performing account executives were the ones with the highest cognitive score on these tests. That was really valuable for us because then we were able to go out and hire people. We were able to use that as a screen up front. It's like the Wonder Lick test. This one's called the Omnia same sort of concept. And then that lasted until we were about 1000 employees. And at 1000 employees broke down. It didn't actually track to the best account executives and account managers anymore. There were different criteria that made sense or people with really high cognitive ability were being outdone by those who have lower cognitive scores. It just didn't matter once you got to size. And in a startup, obviously, you have to figure out a whole bunch of stuff on your own. You don't get enabled. There aren't tools and systems and battle cards for every situation. You're just kind of figuring things out as you go. And a lot of it is left on you to figure out. As you get bigger, there's all sorts of scaffolding around an account executive or an account manager. So all of a sudden, things are being driven for you. And you don't have to figure everything out yourself. When I was thinking about what makes a great salesperson, I wrote down these things. Do you understand who our customers are and how they leverage our solutions? Do you understand our products? Do you connect the dots between the value our products offer and the pain points that customers are trying to solve for? And do you follow a structured process that their customer agrees to that drives to a decision? That also means you're going to show up to the calls prepared. It's going to mean you understand business context during the calls. So you're not just going through the motion, but you're legitimately trying to understand what the customer sells, why it's important who they sell it to, how their systems are set up. You follow up really well. So you follow up with values and key case studies. You look at intent for their products and services. You send interesting use cases that they may use Zoom info for and you leverage reference customers in the sales cycle. And then there's an attitude component to this. And so you're competitive, you fight for every deal, you hate to lose, you think strategically about each opportunity, you understand how to solve problems for customers, you really know the product inside it out and you hustle. You hustle in every deal, you never lose because you get outworked. That's kind of how I think about what makes a really great rep.
  Speaker 2
  One of the things you've taught me is just how lazy everybody is, not just sales, like everyone is just lazy. Like you had me go look at the last 20 cold sales emails that I had received and you said, I'll bet you there's not one that has like anything custom about you, anything. ([Time 0:26:01](https://share.snipd.com/snip/29902317-1e3d-40bd-a3f3-c706ab64b363))
    - **Note:** Good sales people at a start up are smart because they don’t need to sell they need to invent so they have to have high cognitive ability but once you reach escape velocity what makes a good salesperson changes. More in good sales people at later stages they understand the context and they’re active not lazy. Most people are lazy. They consistently stay relevant to customers. Cold emails i stress of being impersonal have detailed business information not generalized high level info.
- Learning to Connect with Enterprise Business Leaders
  Summary:
  The story itself contains this interesting idea, which is, ask yourself, what is the place with the most density of buyers that I could go to? And what is something I can show them visually? They'll have them understand my thing in 30 seconds. My guess is basically no one's ever done that exercise. Yeah, it's really uncomfortable. This happened to me again with our enterprise business. All of a sudden, we got to a place where we're serious about our enterprise business,. Part of the way that we can drive enterprise businesses having me connect with chief revenue officers, chief executive officers.

  Speaker 1
  This happened to me again with our enterprise business. All of a sudden, we got to a place where we're serious about our enterprise business, and part of the way that we can drive enterprise businesses having me connect with chief revenue officers, chief executive officers. And the first few times that I did that, it was really uncomfortable, because I didn't really know what they cared about. I had like an idea, and I brought a deck that we could talk through, but I would show up, and I throw a bunch of stuff out. Oftentimes, none of it hit, and it would be really uncomfortable. And I just kept telling myself, like, once you've done this 15 times, you're going to really understand what people care about, and your pitch will be much more suited for every one of those calls. And so by the 15th time, now I do understand, and I can show up, and it's really comfortable. And we both have like a pretty good time on the conversation, and we get what we need to move a deal forward. But the first 15 times were, they were just learning. They were learning that was kind of like monged up with really uncomfortable conversations.
  Speaker 2
  Just the story itself contains this interesting idea, which is, ask yourself, what is the place with the most density of buyers that I could go to? And what is something I can show them visually? They'll have them understand my thing in 30 seconds. My guess is basically no one's ever done that exercise. ([Time 0:33:18](https://share.snipd.com/snip/85d0671f-05d9-4454-bc18-85dea6e32297))
    - **Note:** Much of the early work is failure and discomfort and you need to accept that and push through the discomfort and accept the early moments are for failure and growth.
- Learning to Sell a Niche Product
  Summary:
  "It was more about learning to sell. You knew you had a product that every customer could use," he says. "But how did you get them to a point of decision? How did you negotiate price?" He adds: "I have no painful memory of not having product market fit"
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  The check should cut in like a week or something. I was like, okay, great, this is going to be an actual thing. So we'd spend 50% of our day gathering data for the product. And then 50% of our day, basically gathering data to market to our potential customers. One of the benefits of where we started was it was pretty niche. And so you knew exactly who your potential customers were. Like the type of business was really specific. And then the type of person at the company was really specific. So the value proposition landed every single time. There was never a call where you got on and somebody said, we would never use this. I have no painful memory of not having product market fit. It was more about learning to sell. You knew you had a product that every customer could use that you were talking to or got a call with. But how did you get them to a point of decision? How did you negotiate price? How did you get to power? How did the decisions actually get made at these companies? So it was really sort of figuring all of that out. Because you knew you had a great product. And it was really like, how do you run a sales process that regularly gets you to a decision and figuring that out hired my friends? Because those are the people I knew. ([Time 0:42:41](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d7e25762-85ed-40b6-95b6-6f2dbde34af1))
    - **Note:** Had immediate product market fit then started hiring his friends to scale the company. The value prop was clear from day 1. Bootstrapped for first 7 years scaling to 30mm before they took outside capital.
- Efficient Go-to-Market Motion as a Strategic Differentiator
  Summary:
  Our go-to-market motion was way more efficient. We just acquired customers in a much more efficient manner than they did, and then kept them at a higher rate. So we bought ranking. We put the businesses together. For us, at that point, it really was the go- to-market motion that created this strategic differentiation That allowed us to make these acquisitions.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Why was that just as an interlude there? What drove efficiency?
  Speaker 1
  Our go-to-market motion was way more efficient. We just acquired customers in a much more efficient manner than they did, and then kept them at a higher rate. So I often tell people, usually, when you think of strategic differentiators, people think about their product. Like, my product is a competitive or strategic differentiator. This thing that we do in the product is the strategic differentiator. But if you just zoom out a little bit, there are lots of places in your business that can be strategic differentiators. For us, at that point, it really was the go-to-market motion that created this strategic differentiation that allowed us to make these acquisitions. So we bought ranking. We put the businesses together. ([Time 0:55:57](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b0071223-5e87-4754-8690-aeaaecb16411))
    - **Note:** Having a better cost structure than your competition can be a sustainable advantage.
- Tips for Evolving a Business: M&A, Corporate Communication, and Business System Concepts
  Summary:
  For M&A, I would say planning is critically important. Get really used to repeating yourself because repetition across the company creates understanding and people will gravitate towards that messaging. And then on this nascent one, do not overestimate the ability of the leaders underneath you to create alignment without a framework for that alignment. It just doesn't happen organically. This is a top down command and control function. But it'll feel exhausting to say the same thing over and over and over again. That's the only way that you can get alignment across key points across the company.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  If you think about one pointer for each of those last three stages of evolution that pops most immediately to mind, I'm curious what those three are. So one each for M&A, corporate communication, and the business system concept that you're establishing now.
  Speaker 1
  Okay, so for M&A, I would say planning is critically important. So knowing what you're going to do before you sign on the dotted line in every part of the integration is really critical. For corporate communication, I would say get really used to repeating yourself because repetition across the company creates understanding and people will gravitate towards that messaging and it'll feel exhausting to say the same thing over and over and over again. But that's the only way that you can get alignment across key points across the company. And then on this nascent one, I would say do not overestimate the ability of the leaders underneath you to create alignment without a framework for that alignment. It just doesn't happen organically.
  Speaker 2
  It is a top down command and control function. ([Time 1:14:52](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0739a81d-2cf8-4f4f-a011-508ace25cc51))
