### Highlights

- Episode AI notes
  1. The overturn of the Chevron deference doctrine aims to redistribute power between Congress, the courts, and the executive branch, leading to uncertainty and debates about the balance of authority.
  2. The Supreme Court ruling may prompt more enforcement actions in the realm of crypto regulations, potentially redefining regulatory approaches and paving the way for innovative enforcement strategies.
  3. The ongoing interplay between branches of the American government suggests a continual balancing act to ensure essential regulations without allowing complete breakdown, with potential influences from the crypto industry experiences on broader legal discussions and future regulatory frameworks.

- Insights on the Evolution of Power in Government Structure and the Impact on Regulatory Agencies
  Summary:
  The landscape of American government with its separation of powers and checks and balances has evolved over the years, with power dynamics shifting between the legislative, executive, and judicial branches.
  The Chevron deference doctrine previously empowered executive agencies but also raised concerns about unchecked authority. While technocrats in agencies can contribute positively by crafting effective regulations, there is a risk of power-hungry individuals exploiting their positions.
  The recent overturn of the Chevron doctrine aims to redistribute power between Congress, the courts, and the executive branch, leading to uncertainty and debates about the balance of authority.
  Despite concerns, the ongoing interplay between branches suggests a continual balancing act that ensures essential regulations without allowing complete breakdown.
  In the realm of crypto regulations, the Supreme Court ruling may prompt more enforcement actions as an alternative to traditional rule-making. This shift could potentially redefine regulatory approaches and lead to novel enforcement strategies. The crypto industry's experiences may influence broader legal discussions and potentially shape future regulatory frameworks, challenging conventional administrative practices and paving the way for innovative enforcement actions in the short term.

  Speaker 3
  Okay, I want to try and do my best to kind of like define the landscape that we're all talking about that has been like evolving over the last like 40 years or so. We have this thing in America for all the European and Asian listeners called separation of powers, checks and balances. We have these three wings of government. We have the legislative. That's Congress. They write the laws. We have the executive. That's the president and the agencies that we're talking about. And then we have the judicial. Those are the courts. And they're all in this three -way finger gun battle about who's what power. And with the Chevron deference doctrine in place, a lot of power went to the executive agencies. That's the Gary Gensler's, the SEC's, the EPA's, the FDIC's, the ABCD's, whatever, any sort of agency. And I think the bull case, the good case for this is like we have this fundamental problem in state of like this like kind of like last mile problem of as like we grow in pot like populace As we grow in like technology, like things get really complex. And so we need to have like this, we need to write a bunch of laws to account for all the things that we do. And so what the Chevron doctrine did is it just deferred all that power to these agencies, which was the executive branch. And but then that introduces this like, well, who's checking on the agency problem. And in the in the good case, we have basically like what Ryan said, a bunch of technocrats, like a bunch of nerds. I really want an environmentalist to be like in the EPA. Like that's that makes sense. Some like researcher person to be in the EPA and they'll they'll just write the rules and that'll be good. Let's let's have like the nerds like run agencies. Exactly. Yeah. And like hopefully they write good laws. They'll figure out how to how to manage well. But then the bear case is that every once in a while, you have the guy who takes the position because he wants power, not because he's a technocrat. And that might be a Gary Gensler. Does Gary Gensler want to promote Gary Gensler or does he want to appropriately and effectively govern capital markets? I think that, from my opinion, might be the latter. And so you have these edge cases where you have these agencies that naturally accrue power over time the longer that they live because they effectively just collect power over time. They just say, oh, I think we should govern over that. And they start to select for that, I think. And they start to select for that. And it comes into a cancer. And this is where you get the Arab -Forgis types, which is only small government like some big small government let's go backwards. And so now we have this Chevron doctrine that is overturned and so rather than these federal executive agencies slowly accruing power over time they're going to dissipate power and It's going to be split up to go to the courts and Congress. And now the courts are kind of the people who are like, well, now who's checking the courts? The Supreme Court is now like the people that like no one is checking on. And this is what some people are saying is like bad, like Elizabeth Warren put out a tweet saying like extremist courts are now like writing the rules. But then we're also saying that like now also Congress will have an increased burden to write appropriate laws in the first place. And so we're taking this power that has really accrued in the executive branch and we're kind of splitting it up into both Congress and the courts. And now we're all kind of unsure as to how this whole thing plays out, but that's where we are.
  Speaker 1
  How's that for the whole summary of all of this? That's pretty damn good. I mean, that's basically it that as with everything else, there's balance. I think a lot of people are both being too triumphal and too pessimistic, depending on how much they hate this case. In thinking that this is like the end state, it's an ongoing finger gun battle, as you point out, between the different branches. And they're all responding to events. They're all responding to different incentives. It never ends. It's always going to go on. If it is the case that this leads to a total breakdown of the government, it's not going to persist very long because the American people will not tolerate a government that literally Can't make sure that the milk you drink is not poison or that we don't have any rules, right? Everybody, I think, agrees that crypto wants some kind of rules. We debate about the nature of them, but nobody wants a total free -for -all, where it's, ah, it doesn't matter. We'll do whatever you want. So I think that is a protector from this being the two downsides of the bear case. But the bull case, the thing I would actually say as well, crypto has experiences where we're special, a proto -loper bright world already. Increasingly, I'm hearing a lot of clever people saying, okay, so the Supreme Court said we can't go after, you know, can't focus on regulations, but doesn't say we can't do enforcement Actions. And maybe this means it's easier to have a court allow novel enforcement actions, even if we can't do regulations. What does this sound like? This is exactly what the SEC has been doing in many ways. They've not been doing rules on crypto for us after all. Instead, they've been doing a whole host of enforcement actions. I think in the short term, you're going to see a lot of people take the Supreme Court literally not seriously, to use the parlance of a recent presidential candidate, I guess, current One. They're going to say that the Supreme Court is speaking literally not seriously. So they're going to try and say, what we can do is we can do enforcement actions now. But in reality, what they're saying is we don't want novel approach to regulatory power at all. But for the short term, for the next few years, it might be the case we see a lot more actions via enforcement actions or trying to comport quasi -regulatory action and enforcement actions On novel spaces. So here too, crypto may be kind of the genesis of a change because we're probably, the industry is going to get through court first in terms of discussing whether or not the current administrative Actions taken by the SEC are actually allowable. And I tend to think they are not under this doctrine we're seeing in Loper Brighton, other anti administrative state cases. If you're saying you can't do this, they're not going to say, oh, but you can do a totally novel off the wall enforcement action. It's not going to fly.

    - **Note:** Chevron deference one argument is it empowers the courts who know nothing and law making should be in the hands of industry experts vs saying when you give agencies too much power they crave power for its own sake and you create agency power vacuums who care about themselves and have bad incentives to create good regulation. 
      It was a good idea that created power vacuums with little accountability so it got overturned people couldn’t be trusted with unchecked power.
