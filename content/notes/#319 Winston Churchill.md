  Speaker 1
  And usually with that, you have an indifference to the opinions of other people in regards to how you should behave or what you should be doing. So it says, in his open pursuit of fame and popular favor, Churchill seemed far less Victorian, as he was expected to act, right? Then Rooseveltian, they mean Theodore Roosevelt. There's going to be a lot of parallels between a young Theodore Roosevelt and a young Winston Churchill. In fact, there'll be a direct comparison a little later on. This is some of the complaints that other people, you're like, you're not being Victorian, you're not acting like you're an aristocrat. What are you doing? Winston advertises himself as simply and as unconsciously as he breathes. Churchill was widely criticized for being a self-advertiser. And he did not care at all about this criticism. He thought, hey, if I can actually seek fame, if I can win glory in these wars and I connect, that's like the way I'm going to break into political life. He says this explicitly, says distinction in turn could be parlayed into political clout, the kind of public life that he longed for and which he believed was his destiny. For that, he was willing to risk anything even his life. And that's the important thing. He was willing to risk his life on things that he believed in. You know, they said it. He could have stayed, he could have spent his time playing polo or fox hunting or anything else. Instead, he goes to Cuba as a military observer. I think he's like 21 years old at the time. And this is the first time that he gets up close with death. He's actually, there's a bullet that goes right over his head and strikes and kills the horse that is standing next to him. When he doesn't get the glory that he wants in Cuba, he's like, okay, well, then I'll just go and fight in India. And he'll use this is another thing. I guess two things. One, he never waits for an invitation. And two, he's completely fine pulling every single string and using every single relationship that he has to get what he wants. Churchill had never had any qualms about pulling every string he had. I am certainly not one of those who needs to be prodded, he said. In fact, if anything, I am a prod. And this is a great description of him at this time. Churchill did not need encouragement. He only needed a chance. And so he goes to India to help the British fight the passions. Now, in his description of the enemy, we see the traits that he admires and other people. And then based on his actions, this is what I mean. I don't even know how to describe it. Megalomania might be the way you describe it. Like his, you don't see what I'm talking about in a minute. In his actions, it just tells you the level of self-belief in this, his complete belief that he's like destined for greatness. He can't be killed because there's no way he's too important and fate wouldn't have him just have like this normal ending. The descriptions of Churchill's belief in this book are my biggest takeaway from it because it just happens, you know, page after page after page. So let me just get into this and hopefully you'll see why just I'm on a loss for words. Like it's incredible the way this guy thought about himself. So he says, the passions fought hand to hand and face to face. They seem terrifyingly heedless of their own safety or even survival. And Churchill, you could, his behavior, you could say the same thing about him. They fought when they had no chance of winning, when they were alone in the battlefield, when they had been shot and speared and bayoneted. Careless of what injury they may receive, Churchill observed in awe. They devote themselves to the destruction of their opponent. And so this is what I mean about this like megalomaniacal self-belief. Churchill understood that he could very easily be killed in the battle the lay before him, but he did not for a moment believe that he would be. I have faith in my star, he said, that I am intended to do something in the world. In fact, soon after arriving in India, he had told a fellow officer that he expected to be prime minister one day. And so he does something. And the note I left myself on this page is like, I don't understand this, this I don't understand. He, he's not trying to blend in on the battlefield. He literally wants to stand out. So he gets this gray pony. And his entire point is to stand out to the enemy. This is crazy. Churchill took great satisfaction in the knowledge that he would be impossible to miss. I rode on my great pony all along the front of the line of the skirmish line where everyone else was lying down in cover. He would later confess foolish perhaps, but given an audience, there is no act too daring or too noble. This mentality continues. This is after the battle he winds up shooting. This is the first time he's ever killed a person. Says he would never know how many men he killed that day before help came. But even as he looked down on the mutilated bodies all around him, the bodies of men he knew men very much like him, he knew that he would not share their fate. He was meant to live of that. He was certain more than that he was meant to do something great with his life. I do not this is check out this quote. I do not believe the gods would create so potent a being as myself for so prosaic and ending. So I think I should actually pause and back up like why? Why am I doing so many?

    - **Note:** Churchill from a young age knew he wanted to live a public life and hold office so instead of living the life of an aristocrat in England he signed up for far flung wars in the name of glory and fame often not asking permission just going. He believed he was destined for greatness and could not be killed he had a crazy self belief from a young age that god would protect him on the battlefield and he was destined to be PM. He rode a grey pony so people would distinguish him in battle this made him a target but he believed he was invincible and wanted glory. Churchill spent the best years of his life composing his impromptu speeches. What seemed organic was the product of a lot of work behind the scenes. Churchill was singularly focused on public office and took a chance thinking he had achieved military glory and lost. Others lost faith in him but he never lost his self confidence and resolve.
- The Importance of Speed and Adaptability in War
  Key takeaways:
  - The British army moved at a slow pace due to the excessive possessions they carried into battle.
  - Ernest Shackleton believed that being burdened with excessive equipment was detrimental to expedition outcomes.
  - The boars prioritized speed over total preparedness.
  - The British army made poor choices by not adapting to the actual environment they were operating in.

  Speaker 1
  This reminds me of something that I learned from reading about Ernest Shackleton. I'll get to it in a minute. In comparison to the astonishing mobile boars who were able to wage war with little more than men, horses and guns, and to move from battlefield to battlefield at a moment's notice, The British army moved at a glacial pace, weighed down by the sheer number of its possessions. And it goes into detail of all the weird things, kind of like creature comforts that they carry into battle into war. It's just very bizarre behavior. And if you've ever read the famous book Endurance, which is the story of Ernest Shackleton, there's a line in there. It's one of my favorite ideas that I've ever come across in any book that I've read. And it says, from studying the outcomes of past expeditions, he believed that those who burdened themselves with equipment to meet every contingency had fared much worse than those That had sacrificed total preparedness for speed. That's a description of the boars. They had sacrificed total preparedness for speed. And we see another bizarre choice. This is again, just like the British in Singapore, where they'd make their in the tropics. It's 100 degrees. It's humid. It's disgusting out. And they're making them wear these wool caps and these costumes, and I'm costume, so these uniforms that are made for much colder climates, they refuse to adapt to the actual environment That they're operating in.

    - **Note:** Churchills grandpa was a famous general and he went out to fight the boer war looking for glory. The brittish were so over confident they thought they would destroy the boers and they did not change tactics or study terrain this lead to a year of heavy losses. The boers on the other hand shot rifles from the time they could hold one and were all warriors. Brittish over confidence vs people fighting for land they believed was theirs. The brittish saw war as an adventure the boers saw it as a part of life they did not seek glory but only victory. Churchill came to this war as a correspondent with the desire to fight from the front. The brittish were incredibly predictable and this is what lead to Winston getting captured. On the battlefield Churchill rose to the occasion the tougher it got the morevresolved he showed. He lives on excitement he prospers under attack the greater the obstacle the greater the triumph. Churchill is held is captivity and he hates being under the control of another man even though he is treated really well as a pow he could not physically submit to someone else. He hatches a plan to escape and in that leaves a letter for the boer army head which leads to a search party and him bring to justice dead or alive he’s deep in enemy territory and the letter was very proud but stupid.
- Churchill's Desperate Search for Shelter
  Key takeaways:
  - At the deepest and darkest point of his life, he finds himself in hiding and spends the night praying.
  - Despite moments of worry, fear, and despair throughout his adult life, Churchill had never been as tentative as he was during this period.
  - He desperately needed a break as he ran low on food, had no shelter, and was all alone.
  - After jumping on and off trains, Churchill came across a lit-up coal mine in the middle of the night.
  - With very little resources and on the run for multiple days, he had to take a risk and approach the coal mine for help.

  Speaker 1
  And yet at maybe the deepest, darkest point of his life, he finds himself in hiding and he spends the night praying. And he said he prayed long and earnestly. And a day or two later, he gets the biggest break of his life. He is running low on food. He is not, he has no shelter. He's all alone. He has no idea what the right move to make is. And he's only 25 years old at this time. And so he desperately needs a break more than any time in his life ever up until this point. And so it says throughout his adult life, which had largely been made up of a series of wars, each one following hard on the heels of the last, Churchill had had moments of worry, fear, And even despair. But never before had he been tentative. This time, because I think he understands like this is life or death, right? This time for perhaps the first time in his life, he was paralyzed within decision. And so as he had been falling in train tracks, he jumped onto some trains and then jumped off. He kept seeing these like little collections of civilization. And he saw one that even in the middle of the night was lit up. And so he walks towards it. It is three in the morning, he walks up to and he realizes it's a coal mine. There's a bunch of small houses on the actual property of the coal mine, right? He has to take a risk. And so he's describing how he felt at this point. Remember, three in the morning, he'd been on the run for multiple days, very little water, almost no food, no weapon, no compass, no shelter, nothing, right? ([Time 0:38:56](https://share.snipd.com/snip/29f1d78c-a1b2-4231-936b-d320f3bda182))
    - **Note:** Churchill had been on the run for days he’s 25 and he’s trekking through enemy territory no food or shelter under threat of being captured. Not a religious man he starts praying there are no aethiesits in a fox hole. He found one of the few in the Englishman in the 110k sq mile country who is allowed to stay because the German people who owned the mine said they needed him for operation. The boers came by the mine that morning looking for Churchill. John Howard the man who rescues him puts him deep in the mime for days while they hatch a plan his life was in the hands of men he didn’t know and just met. Churchill sets off in a carriage to hold wool to the coast putting his faith completely in the hands of other men. Churchill was a voracious reader cknstantly reading and learning. A guy does with Churchill to bribe people and ensure he gets there safely litterally hand delivers him.
