  You don't have to know exactly what the future holds to know that some people will handle it better than others. Gosh, isn't that true? You don't need to know when the next recession is going to come or what the next new technology is to know that some people have the emotional stability and the intelligence to handle Whatever comes so much better than others. This next one is from the author G.K. Chesterton, who once wrote, quote, Ideas are dangerous, but the man to whom they are least dangerous is the man of ideas. He is acquainted with ideas and moves among them like a lion tamer. Ideas are dangerous, but the man to whom they are most dangerous is the man of no ideas. Let me try to unpack that a little bit. I think it's so true that the people who are the most gullible in anything in life, in business and investing, in politics, in relationships, are the people who have no firm beliefs about Any of those things. And the first idea that they hear from somebody that hits them in the head, they think, yes, that must be the truth. You see it all the time. All right, next one. Money can bring happiness, but it also brings complexity. And complexity can quickly lead to unhappiness. So look, does having more money make you happier? Yes, I think it does. I don't want to get into the philosophical debate about how it doesn't and why it doesn't. Yes, it does. That's why we're all chasing it. But it's complicated. And I think what people actually like in life is a simple life. Your simple life can be extravagant. You can have a big house and fly first class and everything, but what they want is simplicity. They just want as few moving parts as possible. Or they want to choose their moving parts. They want to choose the complexity in their life. And a lot of people, when they gain more money, they use it to add complexity to their life in a way that actually leads to unhappiness. All right, next one. A lot of people are pessimistic with their words, but optimistic with their actions. ([Time 0:01:47](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e9798103-0781-419f-bf89-0e3adaf0548f))
- **Uncertainty and Strong Opinions**
  * Having strong opinions is comforting during uncertain times, even without complete understanding.
  * Shrugging your shoulders feels reckless when the stakes seem high but you must do it. 
  * Finance requires cross disciplinary thinking.
  * Be loyal to those who deserve it. 
  * Take hours every once in awhile to just think. Unburdened by the world. Think what’s going right or wrong ect catch up with yourself. 
  * Risk is what you don’t see
  * The most valuable asset is not needing to impress strangers. 
  * Biggest issue isn’t price inflation but expectations inflation. Track your exactions. 
  * Key to success long term is endurance and longevity

  Uncertainty amid danger feels awful. So it is comforting to have strong opinions even when you have no idea what you're talking about because shrugging your shoulders feels reckless when the stakes are high. When you see this most often is something like during a recession or a bear market or a pandemic like COVID-19 when there are truly no answers and nobody knows what's going to happen next. That's when a lot of people come out with their firmest beliefs and say, I know what's going to happen next. This is what's going to happen. Here's what you need to do. It's actually the worst time that you want to take that advice or say it yourself. All right, next one. An engineer can have a successful career knowing nothing other than engineering. Same for a chemist or a meteorologist or a radiologist. Business and investing don't work like that. They're a little bit of math, a little bit of accounting, a little bit of sociology, a little bit of psychology, a few parts marketing, law, politics, game theory, history, statistics, Biology, public relations, on and on. That does not make them harder than other fields, just more uncertain and prone to change and with fewer experts. I like that one.

- **Good Ideas Flow**
  * An abundance of intelligence can be overshadowed by ego, insecurity, bad incentives, or impatience.
  * If an idea is truly good, the work associated with it should flow effortlessly.
  * Cheer for other people 
  * With the right incentives people can support almost any possible. We don’t understand the boundaries of morality that incentives drive. 
  * Optimism and pessimism always overshoot. 
  * Being nice to people is the biggest competitive advantage.
  * Studying history is biased by the fact that we know the ending and in the moment it’s unclear. People in the Great Depression never thought it would end. Impossible to replicate those feelings at the time. 
  * We underestimate our ability to adapt from any set back.

  Any amount of intelligence can be overridden by ego, insecurity, bad incentives, or impatience, usually in that order. Next one here. Some of my best work was easy to write, and the worst stuff that I've ever written was agonizing to write. I think it's similar in most fields. If an idea is good, the work flows easily. Writer's block, or its equivalent in other jobs, usually mean that your idea is wrong. I recently heard someone say a similar idea, which is that if something is working, it's easy to underestimate ([Time 0:12:12](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b87507c4-ee76-4df7-8d7e-ed322e15568c))
