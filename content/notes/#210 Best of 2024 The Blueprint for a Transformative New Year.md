  - Practice emotional regulation using the AVP method: Acknowledge, Validate, Permit.
  - Acknowledge your feelings by naming them (e.g., "I'm annoyed") or describing your physical sensations.
  - Validate your feelings by saying "That makes sense" to create acceptance.
  - Give yourself permission to feel that way and remind yourself you can cope.
  - Practice AVP daily, even when not experiencing heightened emotions, to build the skill.

  So one of my favorite emotion regulation skills to teach adults is something I call AVP. Okay. And it's like the simplest thing and has the most profound impact on people. Okay. So AVP stands for acknowledge, validate, permit. So I'll teach each part. Step one to regulating emotions is acknowledging them. And actually, this is a really good point of the conversation relative to what we just said about this image in the car. So let's say, you know, my kid is whining. Step one, acknowledge like, well, I'm feeling really annoyed. Right. Like in a way, what I'm doing is like I'm the driver of my car and annoyance in the backseat is like starting to kind of make its way to the driver's seat. And I'm like, hey there, hey. And that's literally what I'm doing. I actually use the word high a lot because it always makes me laugh. And to me, if I could add levity to like that process, it gets easier. So I'm like high annoyance or high anxiety, right? Or something like that. So step one is just acknowledge. You can acknowledge by using a quote feeling word, like high annoyance or high sadness. A lot of people don't like really know the name of their feelings and that's totally fine. And you can also do it in a more general way. Like I'm feeling uncomfortable right now. Or I feel like I'm about to explode right now. I'm feeling tight right now. Any acknowledgement. Two is validate. And to me, the best way that our body, I think, likes to be validated, I don't know why, is the term make sense. I think there's something where feelings feel like accepted by logic in our body when we use that term. I don't know. I haven't asked, but I think that's what's happening. So I'd be saying, I'm really, really annoyed right now, or when my kid was whining. And I'd say to myself, well, that makes sense. Like whining is pretty annoying. It makes sense that I feel that way. That is a hugely helpful phrase in regulating our emotions because the reasons our emotions get unregulated, right? Is that they are exploding out of our body in our behaviors. They literally, if you think about these moments of reactivity, when I yell or, right, I'm, the emotion is like coming out of my body and like through my mouth, right? It's kind of like a volcano, right? The opposite of that isn't suppressing emotions because you just can't beat them. So it's always, you know, an unwinnable, you know, endeavor. But we're kind of saying when you regulate an emotion, like it's okay to live inside your body. Like it can just live there. It doesn't have to explode out of you. It can live inside there. Like it has a place. It has a home. So if you think about those two steps already, like first I'm saying hi to it. Like if you're saying hi to someone at a party, like maybe you don't love them, but you're probably like okay with them being there because you said hi. And then you're telling, you're feeling like it kind of makes sense that you're here. And then P is permit, which actually just involves saying to yourself, I give myself full permission to be feeling this way. Right? So another example of going through an AVP would be like, I'm feeling really anxious right now. I'm really, really worked up. And you know, that makes sense. Like I am managing my kids' soccer schedules and you know, I'm thinking about what they need for dinner and I didn't respond to that email. And I think tomorrow is going to be a snow day and then my kids are going to have canceled school. And P permit rate. I give myself permission to be feeling this way. And I think a kicker at the end is just adding the phrase, and I can cope with it. And I can cope with it. I, you know, interesting enough, you're catching me on like last night I was walking in Times Square. And as I do, I film videos myself for Instagram when I'm like on my, on the way to the subway. So I was like filming myself and this guy saw me. He's this 28 year old guy. Stop me. He goes, I'm a 28 year old man. I'm unmarried and I don't have kids. And he goes, and I like, I'm so excited to see you. He's like, you're like a celebrity to me. And he goes, literally he goes, AVP has changed my life. That's what he said. AVP has changed my life. I'm reparenting myself. I know I never learned what some people learned in their childhood and I need to kind of reparent myself through those skills. And AVP has like, you know, changed my life. And so there's a couple ways to use it. If regulating your emotions is new for you, you can't expect yourself to start to regulate your emotions when you're in your most heightened emotions. That would be like someone who has never taken a foul shot. Taking a foul shot, game seven of the NBA finals when time has run out and the game is tied. Like that person is not making it. You take foul shots in practice, low stakes. And so the way I tell people to practice AVP is literally going to their phone right now, setting a random time that they tend to be alone, right? Not in the midst of things. And just literally making a daily reminder that says AVP. And when it goes off, you just stop. And you say to yourself, what am I feeling right now? And it can be like, I'm not feeling much. I don't know. Well, that makes sense because this is a new thing for me to check in with my emotions. So it makes sense that I'm not sure. Permission, I'm giving myself full permission to not know how I'm feeling. Like there's no way to get it wrong. That's what I'm saying. Like, and I promise you after a week or two, not only will you start to recognize more things, but already that skill, that coping skill will start to appear not in 10 out of 10 emotional Situations. It will not, it's not magic, but like in maybe two, three out of 10s. And I think that's like one concrete thing, like all adults can do to start making progress.
