### Highlights

- Adaptation in a Shifting Market
  Summary:
  Market dynamics require continuous adaptation, especially as the scale of capital increases.
  Early-stage investment strategies, like 'cigar butts,' can yield profits but present challenges for scaling. As investment capital grows, it's essential to align approach with the business environment, ensuring control over the firm to prevent outside influences that may disrupt strategy.
  The influence of strategic thinkers, like Munger, emphasizes the need for leaders to reconsider their focus and adapt to their evolving circumstances.

  Speaker 1
  Market change. I even, I've seen that from the time that I started the mid nineties to today, right? And so if you're playing cigar butts, which can be very profitable, but it's difficult to scale that. And so as his capital grew over time, you know, you have to think about how you show up and how you approach it. And we know that Munger was also a key part of that conversation and framing and helping Warren think about what he focused on.
  Speaker 2
  Underneath that is thinking about how he needed to adapt based on his own size and the amount of capital he was trying to deploy. And the environment is not just the computers you might need if you're day trading. Like if you're running a public firm, how do I maintain control of that firm so that we don't have an outside shareholder come in and take control? That'll make me change strategy or change environment. How do you think about environment and the role that it plays? ([Time 0:05:30](https://share.snipd.com/snip/629b23ae-21ed-4adb-b8f7-e539c2789269))
    - **Note:** Understand the games your playing. I’m investing you could day trade hold for 4 years or hold forever and adapt the game to your skills and evolve it with time. Set up your environment so you can do the best work. Allignment you can only be as long term as your clients allow you to be. Know yourself be clear the game your playing and have blueprint takes simple ideas seriously. Have a group of mentors real or through books that orient your life correctly. Learn pay homage to them construct a purposeful plan and then adapt when needed. Focus on what you know. You’re not gonna be right a lot you need to think you’ll be right 55%. Write things down journal your thoughts and ideas so you have them. We don’t want the simplicity at the end of the complexity but we need it. That’s the way forward.
- Clarity in Thought Fuels Performance
  Summary:
  Writing serves as a powerful tool for crystallizing thoughts and reasoning within decision-making processes, as it compels individuals to articulate their ideas clearly, thereby enhancing accountability and facilitating constructive feedback.
  Analysts are encouraged to maintain paper portfolios where they document their rationale for investment decisions—reinforcing critical thinking and fostering a culture of reflective learning through periodic performance reviews. The introduction of decision analytics initiatives allows for real-time feedback on decision patterns, revealing biases and strengths while providing nudges to promote self-awareness during the investment process.
  Emphasizing the importance of simplicity, it's essential to distill complex information into key insights, which requires thorough preparation and a deep understanding of the subject matter.
  This distillation is vital for developing an 'essence statement' that captures the core drivers of a business.
  The insights gleaned from direct experience and rigorous analysis enable individuals to differentiate between valid and flawed distillations, ultimately leading to better decision-making. This method of pushing through complexity and grasping the last 5% of understanding can significantly influence investment outcomes, as illustrated by the case of Motorola Solutions, where in-depth comprehension outperformed prevailing market narratives.

  Speaker 2
  Do you share this with the team? Is there a format? What variables are you writing about? You know, one of the themes is like, how do you accelerate learning and accelerate feedback loops?
  Speaker 1
  And so one of the things that we do is all of our analysts run paper portfolios or model portfolios. And this is something we've done for decades. When you go through the investment process, you write up your various research reports. When you want to buy it, you put forward something to the investment committee, you debate it, and then you buy it in your paper portfolio. And for any decision to buy or sell, you're writing down your reasoning. You're putting down why you're buying, what the thesis is. I like it when you show the things that I want to be looking for, holding accountable to. Just writing things down helps you crystallize the why and putting it down and then tracking, show your work and then track it. One of the things that we do every six months is we consolidate that, we look at the performance, and then we share that with the team members. It's a really powerful feedback mechanism for the analyst, but it's also powerful for us as we're thinking about looking at the simulation, if you will, like who's making good decisions And what kind of decisions. Are you demonstrating more skill on the buy decision, sell decision? Are you doubling down when something's working against you? Are you making better decisions, opining on stocks that you've researched yourself versus stocks that somebody else has written up? Those are all dimensions that are in there that's giving you feedback, which is a really powerful way to help the improvement algorithm. One of the things that we did a couple of years ago, which has been really interesting, is we created this what we call decision analytics initiative. We have a standalone team for individuals. We went out and got third-party software. We run all these decisions from our portfolio managers and our analysts through, and we're looking at to pick up strengths, weaknesses, and biases. It's meant to be kind of like, you know, internal coach. And what's fascinating about it is it's showing you these patterns, right? Like I have specific patterns that I've demonstrated over time. I talked about one of them already with regard to the endowment effect. Another one is regret aversion. The riskiest position in the portfolio is my newest position. So when I'm initiating a position, I tend to scale into it. So let's say I want to take it to 3% of capital. I'll buy 50 basis points and then another 50 and I'll scale into it. Turns out that's wrong. The bias that I'm demonstrating, the reversion is a regret aversion is if it's reached the hurdle that I want to buy it, buy it. And so it's interesting to get that feedback objectively because I have this kind of like working heuristic, but it turns out it's not right. And the data tells you that really clearly. One of the things that we've done with that is then we create these nudges, what we call nudges. And so this is coded into our system. It's watching your behavior real time. And then if you're demonstrating one of these, it'll send you an email. And I'm never that excited when I get them, to be clear. And it'll say, remember the data, you're demonstrating this right now in this position. It doesn't dictate that you do it, but just encourages you to think about it. And so all of that, that whole mosaic is kind of like, how do you create a rigorous process that's repeatable, that really leans on the factors that, you know, can really help reinforce Making the best decisions in a way that can be most constructive to you as an individual.
  Speaker 2
  Is there a correlation between the clarity of people's writing and their performance? I haven't studied the data to specifically support that, but my, I believe so.
  Speaker 1
  When you're able to clarify your thinking in writing is a very strong representation that you've clarified the thinking, right? And it's just one of the reasons why writing is so important is helping to distill it to what's really key. We do a lot of work. We're really fundamental. We can spend months working an idea and then you get this 50 page report. I don't want a 50 page report. I want a few pages that really distill. That's the hard part is to do all the work, but then distill it down to like the few things, the two or three really key points. And in particular, where we see this differently than others, capturing that and knowing kind of those fulcrum issues, like that's the sauce. Coaching too, how do you go through that process of do that really fundamental bottoms up work, but then be able to like really distill it. It's also a manifestation.
  Speaker 2
  I think what you're pulling on that you've, you've gotten to that. It's like there's simplicity on the other side of complexity, but you can only get to that simplicity if you've gone through the complexity. But I feel like everybody wants the simplicity. They want to consume the simplicity. They don't want to do the work. They don't want to go through the raw material. We were talking about this last night, sort of like listening to book summaries in a way, right? It's like, they sound great. And you listen to them in your ear and you're like, oh, that's amazing. But then you go to the source and you're like, how did they miss this? And it contextualizes differently in your head. And the degree of filters between you and the information also matters, right? If you're reading an author talking about a subject that they have no experience with directly, it's going to be very different than reading direct from the source, somebody who touched The problem and had the direct experience. So indirect versus direct experience. And then you talk about sort of distillations, two different people are going to come up with two different distillations. But if everybody just wants to consume the distillations, they're not going to be in a position to know this is a good distillation and this is a bad distillation. There's a couple really good threads in there to pull on. One is the filter, right?
  Speaker 1
  Like it's a, it's a really important thing to think about when you get that distillation back of like, not in there. You really do want to source it. So a lot of times for me, I'll see something and it's like, well, I want to either talk to the management team or listen to them directly. I just want to hear it for myself because I'm going to process it differently and I'm going to pick up on different threads. And you've got to be authentic to that. There's a tendency to want to convince somebody or persua... ([Time 0:22:30](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3407fa3f-96e2-481f-924b-2cd7959ada7a))
    - **Note:** Writing things to clarify thinking feedback loops and simplifying complexity. Understand the last 5% that’s where you are making money. Sometimes the bear case is the bull case. Find out why it’s not different this time and find out why it could be different.
- Accelerate Learning Through Accountability
  Summary:
  A clear blueprint enhances game selection, allowing individuals to leverage their strengths for an unfair advantage.
  It is essential to turn the rocks and actively manage the learning curve by creating case studies that document the rationale behind decisions. Tracking progress over time and measuring outcomes improve decision-making algorithms.
  Accountability is crucial, as one must evaluate incremental steps rather than waiting for long-term results.
  This involves setting clear goals, identifying key indicators, and being analytical about successes and failures.
  Developing the skill to differentiate between what is important and what is irrelevant is fundamental for effective game selection and decision-making.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  We've talked about game selection. We've talked about having a blueprint or a model to sort of follow and imitate before you innovate. Consider this a map. Now what? Now what do we do with this? How do we apply this to create an unfair advantage?
  Speaker 1
  So now it's about like accelerating that, that learning curve and those feedback loops, you know, try to put yourself in a place that's good game selection for you based on who you are And what your strengths are. You got a clear blueprint about how to go after that. And now, you know, you just want to, you want to turn the rocks and you want to accelerate the learning curve. And a big part of that, creating those case studies of writing it down, like, why am I doing this? Showing your work. Part of showing your work is distilling for you why you're doing it, tracking that over time and measuring yourself to it and improving your algorithm. How strong is the learning machine? Are you seeing them take in new inputs based on the feedback that they're getting, adapt that and employ that as they go forward into how they're thinking about stocks, how they're making Decisions. And it's really hard for us the way in our game selection, because we're making these four or five year decisions. So it's very easy to say, well, it's about this and let's check in in five years. No, like there are many incremental steps between now and then that you want to track to and hold yourself accountable to. It doesn't mean you're trading every day or every quarter, but you want to be really thoughtful around, this is why I bought it. These are the things I'm going to be looking for. And then holding yourself accountable during those interim steps and identifying those situations where it's worked well when it hasn't and then adapting for that. Right. And just being really obsessive about that.
  Speaker 2
  It seems like one of the key skills is sort of being able to sift what's important from what's irrelevant. And a lot of people get confused. How do we get to the point where we can actually sift what's important from what's relevant? ([Time 0:36:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/877364ab-d884-4035-8b97-c9f26d5eb0c3))
    - **Note:** Learning loops distillation improvement and finding what is imporyant. Attack negative problems. Dont dismiss incorporate have a predatory instinct to seek out what’s wrong. Write it down journal your thoughts what’s the most important thing. Sift what important from what’s not you need to see from the front not get multi filtered info. Learning is a loop. Compound learning. Understand and investigate both sides of the argument. Nothing as perishable as a good idea so you need many. Constantly turning over rocks. Trying everything you can.
- Practice Like You Play
  Summary:
  Top athletes excel not just in games, but in practice, treating it with the same intensity and seriousness as competition.
  This mindset, characterized by dedication, consistency, and a genuine will to improve, must be instilled in the next generation. Observing role models who embody this work ethic can influence children’s attitudes towards hard work and perseverance.
  It's essential to emphasize the importance of enjoying the process of grinding and honing skills, rather than focusing solely on outcomes.
  Sharing personal experiences of effort and commitment, even if they go unnoticed, can demonstrate the value of hard work to kids.

  Speaker 1
  Never called it survival but i know that that was underneath it of like getting directly to unfiltered the best information i had a friend who was the chief of staff to a ceo of a billion
  Speaker 2
  Dollar company before he assumed this role he sort of said you know i think by and large i know i'm paraphrasing here so these aren't his exact words, but these guys make incredibly stupid Decisions. And I want to help change that. And then he got up there and he's like, actually, they make really good decisions with the information they have. They just have completely terrible information because it's been so filtered by the time it got up to the CEO's office. And so he started this thing where he just started calling the person that he could get in touch with closest to the problem to understand the problem and having briefs from that person And skipping like five layers or six layers of management. And he got in so much trouble for this. I just think that's like a fascinating thing when you think about like, how do we sift what's important from what's not? And some of the variables you mentioned are like getting closer to the information, getting unfiltered information, going direct to people who have experience. And if you think about this in the context of learning, I also think it's fascinating because I think of learning as a loop. There's like, you have an experience, consider that like the 12 hand on a clock you reflect on that experience which is the three hand you create a compression or abstraction which you Can think of as the distillation as the six and then you have an action so you have this loop that constantly feeds back into itself often what we're consuming is other people's compressions And when we do the book summary is a great great example of that, right? You're consuming somebody else's, you don't know what's missing. You don't know how they formulated it. Often they don't have direct experience in the thing that they're even summarizing. And so they're not able to capture the essence of something. Their distillation works for them because they did the work on the raw end and you feel like it works for you as a person. But when you go to put it in practice, it doesn't work. The experience is like this thing that's, you know, like four gigabytes, right? Of memory occupying in your brain. So your brain sort of like, we're going to compress this into something much smaller. That's the reflection angle. You're sorting what matters from what doesn't. You're sort of like decompressing the emotions from things. You're determining what are the variables that govern the situation going forward? How do they interact across time? What are the models that sort of carry the weight here? And then you come to this compression, but you can go back from that compression to the experience. Whereas somebody who consumed just that compression can't go back to the experience. And the way that I try to explain this to my kids, as imperfect as this is, is they, every Sunday we have this cookie recipe and I make them make cookies before they can have the wifi password. So I leave the recipe on the counter. And you know, when they follow the recipe, the cookies turn out amazing. And when they don't follow it exactly, they have no idea what went wrong. Now the chef or the baker who created that recipe would instantly be able to look at a photo probably or take a bite of the cookie and they would know instantly what went wrong. Did they heat the butter too much? Did they not melt it enough? Did they compact the sugar too much? Was the oven running a little hot? And you know, even though it said 360 degrees was at 375, but the baker, they would know that. And you want to surround yourself when you're trying to acquire information with bakers, right? And you want to be the baker, but you can't be the baker in everything. So you have to pick your discipline going back to what game are you playing? Where am I going to be a master and where can I borrow and just crib from other people? Because by borrowing and cribbing the compressions, I'm going to get to average really quickly. I love that. Two thoughts on that.
  Speaker 1
  One is if they were making the cookies and following the recipe, if they wrote it down at each step, what they were actually doing, that gives you something to look back. Like, let's say the cookies didn't turn out well, right? It gives you something to look back at and go and track and see kind of where they might have been off. And then the second part of that, just to the point of having a blueprint and the importance of that is you start with the recipe and you do it, you know, exactly, but then you adapt it. You're like, well, maybe if I put, I really like walnuts or whatever. Chocolate chips. I'm going to put some chocolate chips in this. And then you try that. And the first time you do it, it may not work that well, but I still really like chocolate chips. That's authentic to me. And so you adapt it a little bit. And then in the end, you end up with something that's uniquely you and really special. Totally. And now I want cookies.
  Speaker 2
  Fry me for cookies. Talk to me about the will to win versus the will to practice. It's nice to have that goal, that aspiration.
  Speaker 1
  It's very different to have the will to practice, to grind, to make the cookies every day, and to write it out. Then look back at yourself and look at the steps and measure yourself and showing up in that. And that's why I also tie it just to the concept of it is the journey that gets you to that place. One of the questions that I really love, I think about, and I'm still evolving on is music. If you're a concert pianist, even though you're one of the best musicians in the world, you practice your scales every day. For us as investors, what's the equivalent of practicing scales every day? It's an interesting question. I think there's some parts of it that are temperament related, like just practicing deferred gratification. There's elements of it that are thinking about the world probabilistically, everything, just continuing to practice that every day or the uncertainty of a situation, but not taking That for granted and really practicing that day after day, essentially inoculate yourself to prepare yourself for that.
  Speaker 2
  It's interesting because as you were saying that, part of what popped in my head was if we go back and we look at the grades in sports, because that's an easy reference, but I talked to somebody Who played with Tom Brady and they basically said practice was a game. And if you talk to somebody who played with MJ, it's like practice was a game. You're not coasting. And if you are, calling you out and like um and kobe was the same way where they treat the practice like they would treat a game with the same respect the same effort the same dedication The same frustration if they don't make a play they don't sort of like half-ass it and expect to win on game day when they don't do it in the practice how do you instill that mindset in your Kids? Like where the will to practice, the will to grind, the consistency, the routine or ritual of it and taking pleasure in that and not the outcome. ([Time 0:45:43](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fb9d1d38-f1fa-4307-bad1-796559247cb7))
    - **Note:** You see things through filters you must cut though the bs. Importance of practice but living every moment. First copy write for feedback loops then create. Importance is time allocation. Think what your return on time is for all activities

  Speaker 1
  So it's another form of positioning, right? Do you have the balance sheet when you go into things that are unexpected, but do you also have the mindset for how you embrace things like that when you're in the moment? Because you could just suffer, woe is me, or you could say, okay, this is the hand that I have now. How am I going to play that? If you embrace it in that way, I find that it puts you in a very different position. Immediately it took me a little bit while a little bit of a of a time period to get there but um i think that's less discussed but in another element of positioning i really think that that's
  Speaker 2
  Key right it's like you can't live a hundred years and not go through all of the things that life has to offer from heartbreak to losing money in an investment to and like how you respond And your approach to those things. It's usually not now. And the people who try to push it away or why me, uh, that causes sort of, um, you just start reacting versus reasoning your way through. It's like, no, this is where I'm at. How do I deal with this? Which I think is very helpful mindset, right? Which is, I didn't, I maybe not have created this. I might not have anticipated it. My contribution to this might be really low, but it doesn't change the fact that I'm here. And where do I go next? And what do I do next? We talked about time allocation as sort of capital management. There's another parallel, I think, between business and life, which is personal life and sort of overhead. Talk to me about that.
  Speaker 1
  This is much less discussed, but I think is squarely in your positioning frame is, you know, how you run your personal life very much impacts your ability to make good decisions, particularly If they go sideways, right? And so you see people in the industry who then adopt a certain lifestyle, a certain fixed cost base, and then you need the investment to work as opposed to making what you think are good Risk-adjusted decisions. Into needing to work, you've changed the dimensions of your temperament and your emotions. And once you do that, you put yourself in a bad position to make great decisions. And companies do that. I mean, that's something to be very mindful of. It's something to think about as a firm and investment teams. You're looking for a certain type of individual, but you're trying to create a certain culture within the team. You're trying to have a certain relationship with your clients. Those are all part of enabling you to try to make the best decisions in the way that worked for you. But if you break any one of those kind of components of the fly wheel, if you will, then you really got grit in the fly wheel.
  Speaker 2
  And it could be dangerous in its worst case. ([Time 1:00:39](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4c0c7287-1474-41e1-9130-16a7dfcec106))
    - **Note:** Positioning for success in business and life always.
