### Highlights

- The Rothschilds: the difference in mentality between the founder of the dynasty and those who come afterwards
  Summary:
  The founder of the Rothschild dynasty had an insatiable appetite for their work, viewing it as a hobby they enjoyed.
  This mindset led them to continue growing their wealth and success. However, their descendants often simply enjoyed the fruits of their labor without the same drive or passion for the work, leading to a life of idleness and self-indulgence.
  This contrast highlights the difference in mentality between the founder who sought continuous growth and those who came afterwards.

  Speaker 1
  And so the first family I'm going to talk about is the one that really out of everybody in the book kind of buck the trend. And that's the Rothschilds. And we'll get into there. Because, you know, there's never been another Nathan Rothschild, but they have been able to muster enough talent and discipline to not squander the wealth that's been built up over The last few centuries. And so David has a great way of putting the difference in mentality between the founder of the dynasty and those usually the people that come afterwards. He writes it in French, so I had to go and translate this. This is the first time I come across this maxim and it's excellent. Something that I already put in a read-wise, something I'm going to keep reminding myself of. And he says, for many of the great founders, appetite comes with eating. I was like, what the hell does that mean? And it's a saying that means that the more you have, the more you want to have. The great founders are obsessed with what they're doing. They want to continue doing more of it. They enjoy it. It's like work as their own hobby. Their descendants just like the fruits of the labor, in many cases, the labor that they did not themselves do. And so they like these like lazy, like what he calls a life of idleness and self-indulgence. But that is one of my favorite lines in the entire book. For many of the founders, appetite comes with eating. The more that you have, the more you want to have. And I think that's obvious if you look back on a lot of the founders that you and I have talked about, a lot of the founders that you and I have read biographies on, their exes strategies, Death. They found their life's work and they had no intention of retiring and they just kept doing it because they enjoyed to do it.

    - **Note:** The ones on the margins eventually control the center. Power law people start dynasties by doing their life’s work and gaining power but then their family squanders it. The power law original person cannot be replicated and they want to win to win but everyone one after them wants to copy the people they once disrupted.
- The Rothschilds: How a family dynasty began with a formidable individual
  Summary:
  The Rothschild family started with a single powerful individual who enforced the rule that family members must work in the business but never as partners.
  They were wary of outsiders and practiced incest to maintain control. Nathan Rothschild, Mayor's third son, stood out with his bright and enterprising nature, self-confidence, and belief before evidence.
  He immigrated to England, quickly amassed a fortune in cottons, and solidified his position by marrying into wealth.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  The family occupied what little space was left. There was one bedroom for mayor and his wife. In the other bedroom, the children, boys and girls of all ages, were piled together atop a house. Together atop one another. As they grew old enough, they were all enrolled in the business. As the children got old enough to marry, their spouses were also joined in the enterprise as employees, but never as partners. He actually puts that rule in writing on his last will and testament. They were very, very fearful of outsiders, and another way they avoided this, which I'll get into a little bit, there was a lot of incest. Eventually, this is something that's going to reoccur. Like I said, all the dynasties can be traced back to one formidable individual. We're going to call the people the power law person. Eventually, the power law person will appear, and that is going to be for the Rothschilds. That is going to be Nathan Rothschild. It was Mayor's third son, Nathan Rothschild, who gave the Rothschilds a special advantage when he immigrated to England. Nathan was bright and enterprising, and he had the kind of pride that exacerbated those who expected Jews to be suitably meek and deferential. As we'll see, he also had extreme levels of self-confidence way before. There's this great maxim that belief comes before ability. He had extreme levels of self-belief. Way before there was any evidence that that belief was justified, we'll get into that in a minute. He quickly made a fortune in cottons and then married the daughter of one of the richest Jews in England. ([Time 0:14:28](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3381b5f1-0940-4f61-b9fe-d6003c5820d6))
    - **Note:** Believe comes before achievement. The Roth Childs lived in the first ghetto in Germany. They turned this weakness into a strength by remaining close knit and leveraging the relationship of close family and associates. Nathan was the 3rd son but became the leader. He went to London and this was a great time to be a banker in London. There was industry that needed to be financed and he was the right person right place right time.
- The Rothschilds: A Tenacious Dynasty in Modern Business History
  Summary:
  The Rothschild family, one of the richest in the world, has been abundantly cautious in their approach to wealth accumulation and inheritance over almost 200 years.
  The family embodies a stark contrast between Nathan, who dedicated himself to making money, and his descendants who focus on spending it. Unlike other dynasties, the Rothschilds have maintained their power and influence in the business world through generations, hinting at a unique ability to generate wealth.
  Their persistence and enduring legacy make them one of the most important and tenacious dynasties in modern business history.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  You are already one of the richest families in the world, if not the richest family. And being abundantly cautious is probably the correct move. If the continuation of continual accumulation of money and then pass it down to the next generation is the goal. And we are living almost 200 years after the events that you and I are discussing this book, and we can't tell how much money they have, but we know they have a lot. I should say it is likely that they have a lot. The authors then comparing and contrasting Nathan, the power law person, power law founder, with his descendants. Nathan had given himself heart and soul to making money. His descendants worked rather to spend it, a theme that we show, see repeat itself for many of the great dynasties, but unlike many of the great dynasties where the offspring began to Stray, many Rothschilds remain powerful in the business world. It is as if they possessed a secret genetic gift for making money. And then this summary of the section is exactly why I wanted to talk about them. First, the Rothschild families perhaps the most important in tenacious dynasty in modern business history. Only a few dynasties have shown as much persistence across centuries. Okay, let's jump right into the Morgan's. The great thing about the Morgan chapter is the author does a lot of the work for you and I, where he is going to constantly reference, I guess, compare in contrast. The Morgan's and the Rothschilds. ([Time 0:24:10](https://share.snipd.com/snip/14e12171-2786-4554-86b9-33628e7e305b))
    - **Note:** The Roth Childs had a great network and thought long term. They had contacts that could finance and move money with ease and discretely so much so that we don’t know much about their dealings. In the end Meyer decreed that they would keep everything in the family which lead to a lot of incest but helped keep the wealth. After he died the family was more focused on enjoying life than working hard to build wealth.
- The Rise of JP Morgan in American Business History
  Summary:
  JP Morgan, at the right moment in history, seized the opportunity in a frontier nation different from Europe, characterized by large-scale business syndicates and monopolies.
  Known for his insightful quotes, JP Morgan believed that a man always has two reasons for his actions - a good one and the real one. Despite not being the wealthiest robber baron, JP Morgan's involvement in crucial industries like railroads, oceanic transportation, steel, and iron made him a prominent figure.
  In 1901, he orchestrated the formation of US Steel, the world's first billion-dollar corporation, by acquiring Carnegie Steel to establish a competitive position in the steel industry.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And so now we got to the point where I mentioned earlier that JP's at the perfect time in history. The rush child's had missed the American boat. Junius Morgan with his son's firm in New York had not. This frontier nation was a different world, different world in Europe. It was large scale, full of business syndicates and monopolistic. And JP was the man to find the funds and take these things in hand. There's also a bunch of quotes in this book. They give you an idea of who JP Morgan was as a person. I think this isn't a good example of that. JP once said a man always has two reasons for the things he does. A good one and the real one. And so even though JP Morgan was not the richest of the robber barons, he did, he was like involved in all the different important industries at this time. So that's why he's so well known. The American economy took off after the Civil War at the heart of its growth were the railroads. So he was involved in railroads. He also was involved in oceanic transportation. And then he winds up getting involved in steel and iron. So it says link to both the transport industries was iron and steel. And it was Morgan that in 1901 put together US Steel. This is the world's first billion dollar corporation. Part of that was buying, he bought a bunch of businesses, but he winds up. The main thing was buying Carnegie Steel, Andrew Carnegie's company. And the reason Morgan bought him out is because Morgan wanted to compete in steel and Carnegie had built by far. The best steel company. ([Time 0:35:47](https://share.snipd.com/snip/490dcf79-0aa6-48fb-b9e0-cf659ddba769))
    - **Note:** J.P. Morgan’s dad was the man who established the empire and coaching jp in letters being very hard on him and pushing him to greatness. They saw the opportunity in America that the other bankers missed and grasped it. There are 2 reasons for an action the stated one and the real one. Jp worked in sprints where he would work hard for 9 months then take 3 off vs other relentless founders. His dad did much to set the family up for success and jp took advantage of that positioning when the opportunity arose in America. Jp was very good at finding technology waves and riding them like railroads and steel. He was also cut throat and would cut you down by the knees. But he had no real heirs who were strong enough to lead so the company went public.
- Making Something for the Benefit of Society and Learning from Competitors in the Development of Japanese Cars
  Summary:
  The key takeaway from this excerpt is the importance of creating something that benefits society.
  It emphasizes the significance of building products that have a positive impact. Furthermore, it highlights the value of learning from competitors in the product development process.
  By studying competitors like Sam Walton did in the automobile industry, one can gather valuable insights and improve their own innovations.
  This approach was exemplified in the story of Kichiro visiting American automobile plants, taking notes, and drawing inspiration to build Japanese cars.
  The narrative underscores the power of observation, note-taking, and creative adaptation in innovation. The episode also touches upon the anecdote of Sam Walton's meticulous note-taking using a tape recorder and his respectful interaction with competitors like Soul Price's son, demonstrating humility and a willingness to learn from others. The importance of history and context is also stressed, with a reference to the early development tour in 1929, highlighting the significance of understanding the origins of ideas in innovation.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  You should make an effort to make something that will benefit society. That is the most important sentence in this entire chapter. I will read it again. You should make an effort to make something that will benefit society. He challenged Kichiro to build a Japanese car with Japanese hands. So Kichiro goes to America, and he does what Sam Walton did. He visited his soon to be competitors, more than anybody else. He visited automobile plants and took copious notes on what he saw and heard, just like Sam Walton did. I don't remember if I mentioned on this recent Soul Price episode. I did a few episodes ago, but they catch. They caught Sam Walton walking through like a Price Club, I think, at the time. And I think Soul Price's son was one running the business at this point. And he had been walking around, not just taking notes, but he had like this, like a, like a, a recorder, a tape recorder. She's walking around like a microphone, and he just notes to self. Do this, do that, do that. Mine's getting caught. They confiscate his tape recorder in the tape. Sam Walton writes a letter to Robert Price, which is the son of Soul Price. He's like, hey, I understand if you don't want to give me my tape back, but can at least have my tape recorder back? And Robert's like, you know, I'm not going to, like, we're not going to destroy your tape. And he sent him back, you know, all the notes didn't delete anything. And he's just like, here, Sam, take it. Okay, so let's go back into the early development tour. Remember, keep this in mind. 1929 is when they have the idea. ([Time 0:45:08](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e3b6dcf7-3318-4a01-9d94-53d99fb616e3))
    - **Note:** The Toyota family made all their money making power looms they wanted to be the best in the world and eventually we’re one of the best but then they ended up selling. The patriarch told his son to make something that creates value in society. His son visits America and has the idea to build cars. He then shops his competitors like ford to get a better sense of the processs. Toyota isn’t just about building cars but about the wider production system that forms to create a car. They struggled to build an engine so they basically replicated a Chevy engine which gave them interoperability because if their engine broke they could just buy Chevy parts which was important for them to get to scale because they didn’t have enough resources to build out the full operation so they created a proof of concept. The company build constantly resource constrained and after losing the war pivoted you growing food but after the us occupied Japan and needed cars Toyota was right there. They had been saved by the us government who constantly invested in them but when kitchiero retires he says he wants to build a first class company in the free market rather than being a 3rd rate company selling to governments
- The Toyota Production System: How Ono's Lean Manufacturing Revolutionized Manufacturing Worldwide
  Summary:
  Ono, a professional manager and mechanical engineer at Toyota, developed and implemented the lean production system known as TPS.
  This system aimed at reducing waste by delivering materials just in time to workers, cutting down on waste of time and space. Despite facing challenges due to deep-rooted habits, Ono's lean manufacturing process eventually revolutionized manufacturing globally, with the TPS being considered a significant technical innovation comparable to Ford's assembly line.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Ejai is still really young. So the actual real power in the Toyota company at this time was with this guy named Ono. That's his last name. Ono. Who was a professional manager and a mechanical engineer. Ono had vision. It was he who developed and implemented Kichiro's idea of lean production into a system that became known as TPS or the Toyota production system, which could be used in making not only Automobiles, but all manner of complex industrial products. TPS was perhaps the most important technical innovation since Ford's successful implementation of the moving assembly line, and the Toyota production system has transformed manufacturing Throughout the world. The aim was to waste neither time nor space, which they did not have an abundance of. They were lean and mean. Workers didn't need to move about, and materials were delivered to them. Materials arrived only when needed are quote unquote, just in time, which cut down considerably on waste. Much of what Ono wanted ran against deep-rooted Japanese habits of hoarding against feared shortages. His lean manufacturing process took several decades to develop and perfect, so the great benefits were not clearly visible at first. And so in 1967, the family finally thought that Ejai Toyota was ready to take back the reins. ([Time 0:53:51](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5dc8b9c3-4fd2-476c-9ee9-20fc006c11dd))
    - **Note:** Toyota invented the tps which was the Toyota production system which counter positioned against Japanese dogma about have excess inventory in hand. This innovation optimized the limited space and resources inventing the just in time manufacturing process. This created a new era of Japanese manufacturing and new way of creating around the world. They studied America and went from producing 40 cars a day to 3mm a year. Shop competitors took 70 years from inception to scale.
- The Railroad Scheme that Made John D. Rockefeller’s Fortune
  Summary:
  Published railway tariffs favored small businesses, not major shippers like Rockefeller, who could ensure steady cargo by playing railways against each other.
  Rockefeller promised stability amidst the booms and busts in railway traffic, demanding the best prices secretly. Despite being deemed unethical, Rockefeller's strategy of offering preferential rates led to federal legislation outlawing such practices.
  By forming a cartel and persuading important refiners to join, Rockefeller ensured favorable rail rates, causing resistant oilmen to fail while those who complied grew rich.
  Rockefeller's long-term vision and advice to accept stock payment showcased his foresight in an industry under his control.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  It's fake. Published railway tariffs were for the small man. They were not for major shippers who could play one railroad against another while promising steady cargo. This is why this is the most important fact that this all hinges on. Rockefeller was such a large producer that he could promise the railways steady amounts. As you probably know, there's a history of booms and busts with railway traffic just like in many other industries, just like in the oil industry. And Rockefeller was like, I'll smooth that out for you, but I want the best prices available. Another important part, this was secret. When it was found out, it was made illegal. These were not seen as ethical so that in the long run, federal legislation made preferential rates illegal. By then, the game had long been played out. Rockefeller succeeded in persuading just about every refiner of importance to join his cartel. That was the only way that they could obtain good rail rates. The stubborn holdouts, meaning the other oilmen, the stubborn holdouts went under and died hating him. The wise ones sold. Most of them took cash. The smart ones took stock and became rich. John D told them to do that. Good advice. Even so, they hated him. And this goes back to that predilection for long-term thinking when most other humans can only see what's right in front of their face. John D deserves credit for vision. The vision of what could be if only the industry could have been gotten under control. ([Time 1:01:04](https://share.snipd.com/snip/221f5cdc-d599-49d2-b1fe-a357db100a52))
    - **Note:** Rockefeller used his intelligence and cunning to undercut everyone and gain monopolistic power. He believed he was put on the earth to make money. He expolieted and killed competition on his road to success. He was best in class in a grow industry and thought long term when everyone thought short term. He would give the people he bought out stock and would show others his books to demonstrate he could kill them. He kept everything secret bad boys move in silence. Kept family out of the business so there was no dynasty.
