- You are the sum of your 5 closest friend

- To understand someone’s world view you need to drop your preconceived notions and mitigate your identity. It’s hard to change someone’s mind when you feel morally and intellectually superior to them. The better your message makes you feel the worse your point is most likely. Understanding the other side makes it possible to change minds. You need to Acknowledge the weaknesses in your own position and this will act as a strength to your identity and your view. You generally will butt heads with the people you most agree with ie neighbors fighting over the 5%. You need to hold your identity lightly and you need to know when to gas it and when to let up

    - **Note:** You need to hold your identity lightly. You can't change someone’s mind until you're willing to understand their problems on a genuine levels from their point of view. You need to drop your feelings of superiority and seek to understands. Be humble and inquisitive.
      To understand someone you need to mitigate identity and surrender yourself to their thoughts
- Feeling like the embattled minority only makes you dig in on our beliefs stronger. When something becomes part or closer to a part of your identity your views on that subject will be more biased. When you make views public they become closer to your identity

    - **Note:** Hold your views and identity lightly. When threatened or pushed people fight back and dig in. Likewise create an open and honest debate culture not a gotcha im stick to my beliefs culture. Allow people to change their mind gracefully
- 1. People assume their map is correct vs assuming it’s probably wrong and needs revision 2 is more likely here Bayesian updating your map 2. Leaning into confusion signals the areas where your map and reality aren’t lining up in these moments you need to investigate as these are likely blind spots that could but not necessarily are wrong 3. It’s hard to understand disagreements and it takes a lot of work to try and succeed in understanding disagreements. It’s really hard to change your mind you need to give yourself the greatest chance to understand why you should/ might

    - **Note:** The map is not the territory and we must form a high level map from base rates then drill in. Investigate blind spots and lean into confusion don't run from it. Prove yourself wrong and be open to changing your mind even if its hard
      Don’t run from confusion that is the signal you should investigate it’s hard to understand and change your mind that’s why it’s so valuable.
      Assume your wrong update bayseanly > embrace confusion > understand and align mental models not surface level understanding > give yourself the greatest chance to change your mind
- Have constructive conversations with people who are intellectually similar even if their beliefs are completely opposite. Better to be open to positive debates with good meaning people than just flaming the far out points that no one is really making. Listening to people who share your goals but have a completely different way of approaching them leads to learning 1. We misunderstand each others views because 30 second elevator pitches can’t convey a complex topic 2. Good arguments for things get muddled by the bad arguments and credibility for the whole point is lost and anyone who believes it there are good and bad arguments for every point can’t dismiss it just in the bad ones 3. Our beliefs are interdependent so when we change one others become altered so under this web making changes is tough you have to uproot the house You can have good intentions and think your making good decisions but in reality you could be very wrong about these two points

    - **Note:** Have conversations who share your values for honest debate/ discourse not your beliefs and get the strong version of the argument not the strawman. It’s hard to change our minds because our beliefs are interdependent so changing one beliefs alters many. You cannot have a good argument in 30 seconds so you must take the time to listen and understand someone's thinking. Good arguments get obstructed by bad arguments. Were fallible and our arguments can be completely wrong.
      It’s more important to talk with people who share your ideals for open and honest debate at a system level than agree with you at a point level and good conversations take time. Takes time and work to understand someone. Fallibility of knowledge
- Lean into confusion. If there is a grey area or disconfirming evidence try to investigate the situation instead of dismissing it. Anomalies are puzzle pieces that help you craft your world by investigating and not dismissing confusion you open up your ability to learn
    - **Tags:** #favorite, #disconfirming-evidence-(seek-it-out), #anomalies, #open-minded, #conviction-(do-the-work-to-sleep-well-at-night), #embrace-confusion
    - **Note:** Anomalies and disconfirming evidence help you find where the inconsistencies and future learnings are. Explore anomalies.
- Revise opinions incrementally over time adjusting to new evidence and slowly moving closer to where you think the truth is moving while respecting your original anchor point and errors become opportunities to learn and adjust your mental model You can never be right or wrong if your beliefs in the moment are informed by all the information you have at hand you could have to update your probabilities but you don’t get gratification or failure through random chance or through another method you had nor considered or deemed unlikely Admit to being wrong and update your beliefs based on the new world view

    - **Note:** We are all fallible and we need to take in new information see how it compares to what we know and adjust our beliefs according avoid over and under reaction. Your beliefs are a version of you and you constantly seek to upgrade. embrace truth. We need to view everything good and bad as a past version of ourselves that gave our current version the tools to do it's best.
      Constant improvement every day and respect we are fallible people. Update incrementally
- You can either give into instant satisfaction and gratification which will long term lead to failure or eat shit for awhile which will be tough for your self imagine and esteem but long term leave you with better positioning

    - **Note:** Delaying gratification. Hard days easy life easy days hard life. Position yourself to win in the long term.
- Epistemic confidence is how much you believe in your point Social confidence is how self assured you are You can be self assured without being overconfident and being overconfident is more bad than good Your social confidence in a situation how comfortable and assured you are has little to do with how right you think you are. Understanding the risks of the situation and making an accurate judgement while been calm and confident is better than “knowing” the truth
    - **Tags:** #confidence, #favorite, #epistemic-vs-social-confidence, #fallability-(of-knowledge), #believe-in-yourself, #grey-thinking, #writing-topics
    - **Note:** Social confidence vs epistemic confidence. Social is how self assured you feel in an interaction while epistemic confidence is your confidence of your knowledge. Overconfidence is bad when is causes you to look past facts. You can believe in yourself and still think grey. Social confidence can mean you feel really certain of your uncertainty and open to hearing more.
- An accurate picture of the odds let’s you know how much to stake. Irrational optimism is never the right path
    - **Tags:** #objectively-view-situations, #optimism-(active-sense), #critical-approach-(conjectures-and-refutations), #blind-optimism/pessimism, #embrace-reality
    - **Note:** Avoid blind optimism of pessimism but be realistic with the task.
- We need to think grey instead of thinking in certainties either 100% or 0%. Press secretary of trying to paint the rosy picture vs the board trying to figure out the truth. Calibrate your bets by assigning percentages to each side to get a sense of what the payoff needed given what the risk is
    - **Tags:** #probabilitic-thinking, #critical-approach-(conjectures-and-refutations), #risk-and-return, #grey-thinking
    - **Note:** Assign percentages not booleans.
- To notice your bias you need to understand the argument from both sides 1. Double standard test am I too harsh or loose on my own position am I setting a double standard 2. The outside view of I started day 1 what would I do right now 3. Conformity or yes man test. Try people’s opinions and see if they have a true opinion for the other side or they’re just bs and copying 4. Selective skeptic test only criticizing the views you dint hold abs more or less blindly accepting conforming evidence even if it might be non rigorous or wrong 5. Status quo bias test we are loss averse to the present and would rather keep with the status quo than deviate for what might be better for us. View both situations staying in your job and leaving it objectively before moving

    - **Note:** How do we stay more objective and less bias
      1. Ignore sunk costs/ status quo. Inside outside view. Selective skeptic/ double standard test am i criticizing all views or just the ones I don’t like. See if others have thought through opinions or just accepted a belief system. See both sides
- Signs of a scout mindset 1. Admit to being wrong 2. Take criticism constructively 3. Prove yourself wrong 4. Take precautions to avoid fooling yourself ie anonymize the data so it won’t effect the conclusion 5. Have strong critics that understand the argument and provide reasonable feedback

    - **Note:** Admit ignorance learn and grow through criticism. Seek to be wrong. Don’t fool yourself. Reason critical get feedback.
- People choose things for immediate benefits but if you can take things on with a view of the future your payoff is greater

    - **Note:** Hard days easy life. Easy days hard life
- Chesterton fence you need to know the reason behind something before changing it if you don’t know why it’s there you’ll do more harm than good. Soldier mindset can help us avoid fear and no win situations. Ie pain being necessary when there is no alternative. It makes us feel better like a warm blanket. We use the soldier mindset to convince ourselves and then others were doing well when that night actually deviate from the truth. We use this mindset to feel better about ourselves but this isn’t always optimal

    - **Note:** We need to understand the problem before making any changes to the system. Know why before destroying. The soldier mindset is like the ladder where there is motivated reasoning vs truth seeking.
- Truth seeking vs being right. Being wrong can either be seen as a defeat or a step closer to the truth wishful thinking vs objectivity and intellectual honestly. Soldier and scout mindsets are two extremes and we occupy the different roles in different areas of our Lives

    - **Note:** Seek to disprove ideas then improve upon them. We should want to be wrong because then we can be closer to being right. Open and inquisitive. Truth seeking ruthlessly above all vs wanting to be right
- Motivated reasoning when we want or don’t want something to be true we ask can I believe this and the other way we ask how is this not true. We start with a view. Directionally motivated reasoning vs accuracy motivated reasoning confirming your biases vs seeking the truth above all else. Being open to changing your mind wanting your map to be as accurate as possible even though the map isn’t the territory
- The scout mindset is the motivation to see things as they are not how you want them to be. Our judgement isn’t limited by ability it’s limited by attitude

    - **Note:** See things as they are not how we want them to be. Judgement is limited more by bias than intelligence.
