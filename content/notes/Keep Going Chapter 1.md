- Summary: Creativity is a daily practice, where you focus on making something beautiful each day, despite the ups and downs. Establishing a routine can help you stay productive and manage life's chaos, allowing you to create consistently. Lists can also bring order to your thoughts and tasks, making it easier to tackle what needs to be done.

### Highlights

- We have so little control over our lives. The only thing we can really control is what we spend our days on. What we work on and how hard we work on it. It might seem like a stretch, but I really think the best thing you can do if you want to make art is to pretend you’re starring in your own remake of *Groundhog Day*: Yesterday’s over, tomorrow may never come, there’s just today and what you can do with it.
  “Any man can fight the battles of just one day,” begins a passage collected in Richmond Walker’s book of meditations for recovering alcoholics, *Twenty-Four Hours a Day*. “It is only when you and I add the burden of those two awful eternities, yesterday and tomorrow, that we break down. It is not the experience of today that drives men mad. It is remorse or bitterness for something which happened yesterday or the dread of what tomorrow may bring. Let us therefore do our best to live but one day at a time.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jhdksk30r09vmerzgtqmhnxf))

    - **Note:** presence is key just make the most of today. Take life one day at a time. Anyone can fight the battles of one day.
- A daily routine will get you through the day and help you make the most of it. “A schedule defends from chaos and whim,” writes Annie Dillard. “It is a net for catching days.” When you don’t know what to do next, your routine tells you.
  When you don’t have much time, a routine helps you make the little time you have count. When you have all the time in the world, a routine helps you make sure you don’t waste it. I’ve written while holding down a day job, written full-time from home, and written while caring for small children. The secret to writing under all those conditions was having a schedule and sticking to it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jhdkw4rw6fxbrn6qja8et3a4))
    - **Note:** Have a daily routine that enables you to do work in your schedule
- I suppose for some people a strict routine sounds like prison. But aren’t we all, in a sense, “doing time?” When rapper Lil Wayne was in prison, I found myself envying his daily routine, which consisted of waking up at 11 a.m., drinking coffee, making phone calls, showering, reading fan mail, having lunch, making phone calls, reading, writing, having dinner, doing push-ups, listening to the radio, reading, and sleeping. “Man, I’ll bet I could get a lot of writing done if I went to prison,” I joked to my wife. (When I visited Alcatraz, I thought it would make the perfect writer’s colony. *What a view!*)
  A little imprisonment—if it’s of your own making—can set you free. Rather than restricting your freedom, a routine gives you freedom by protecting you from the ups and downs of life and helping you take advantage of your limited time, energy, and talent. A routine establishes good habits that can lead to your best work. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jhdm2vszcd3r9k4dt1fxvdnb))
