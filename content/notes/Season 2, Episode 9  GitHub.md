- Monetizing Open Source Projects
  Summary:

  This strategy fuels growth by allowing free access to open source projects, drawing the premium line at private repositories. Successful premium models focus on monetizing where users find the most value, striking a balance between growth and profitability.
  The timing of this strategy aligns with the growth of open source development, transitioning from being viewed as value-destructive to a thriving business model.

  Speaker 2
  To make open source projects pay for bik keeper, everybody defected. And then that led to get merterial. So that obviously they can't do that. But what if we charge companies who are using this for their own private code bases? We'll discharge them, and we'll make it free for open source.
  Speaker 1
  It's really brilliant. Like it is the thing that's keeping us growing, the ability for public repose that have no permission said on them, that people are doing, open source projects being free to access, And thus continuing to fuel growth, ever monotizing people that want to do things that are counter to growth by locking it down, it's like the perfect place to draw the premium line, Totally. I think that from a lot of the companies that we've examined on this show, i i think it's really helped me inform am what makes sense in a premium model versus what make sense in a free trial Model. And in the premia model, it's really all about mea a massive component who are youging to build a successful business is, are you able to draw the line in the place such that you're both Fueling growth and moditizing exactly in that place when people are finding it so valuable that they'd be to pay and and when people want to do private repose like that's exactly that Place. It's exactly that place. And not only that, they've just completely nailed the timing.
  Speaker 2
  Back to are hopefully not too dense and not too poor description of the openas as concernd b earlyor than yet more and more exactly. I agree. Please don't judge us, harthly, it's been a long day. Ah, the a a. Back to the open source community. This is right at the time when open source projects an development is just exploding, like it was, like people used to think, open source, thay used to think len in operating systems. And value destructive?
  Speaker 1
  Yes? And value destructive. Interestingly, and and particularly to foreshadow the microsoft acquisition, like microso was the one carrying the banner on open sources, value destructive. It's a threat to our business model. It's a threat to selling licenses, selling soft or license s. It's a threat to every everybody's trying to create a soffor development eco system and platform. And, i mean, people had done ok, like red hat figured out a business mall around open source. But it was unclear if open source could ever actually be a successful businessy and and you go from that, again, were it was all centered around operating systems, tol.
  Speaker 2
  Now you've got programming languages are open source. Ruby's open source. You've got hoodupe, which is open source. You've got data tools, you've got visualization tools, you've got, you kdow, i don't think like reactnative, it was was around at that point, but like now it is, like all these mobile
  Speaker 1
  Development frameworkret thousand and dravascript frameworks er, all open tere so that you can pick four of them and use them in some strange concert. Thatth proliferation of open sors tools, needless to say, has its own and that had a couple, there were a coupleof secondary effects from that.
