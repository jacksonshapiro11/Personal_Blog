  What I might ship in to your starting question is there is a ton of historical irreverence while we really benefit from that history in this strong capital base. We're also feel constantly free to rethink the entire model because nobody here owns it. There's no founder who we look at and think, well, you don't want to offend so and so in the corner office by questioning the way we did that thing. Our sort of historian in chief when I joined was a partner named Phil Dehardeman, and he was actually a professor at the business school at Harvard. And he's just a hoot. And he was the first to make fun of the traditions that we had and just constantly questioned everything. So I think there's a long tradition of us saying, this is how we've done it for years and years. It's probably somewhat wrong. Let's rethink it all the time. And in the 15 years I've been here, our operating system has changed in several major ways.
  Speaker 3
  We spend a lot of time studying the, I guess I'll call them like the heritage brands, the Hermezas and Rolexes of the world. ([Time 0:07:45](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9de5c88b-8388-4083-98d7-300f3810c8c4))
    - **Note:** Re thinking tradition. Long time horizon. Need history and time to carry the weight of incredible brands.
- Autonomy and Investment Style at Bessemer Venture Partners
  Key takeaways:
  - Besmer encourages more autonomy than almost any other venture firm
  - Decision making and investment style are encouraged to be individualized
  - Style drift is managed by Besmer but not discouraged
  - Late stage buyout type deals may be considered by Besmer, but individuality in investment strategy is promoted
  Transcript:
  Speaker 3
  How far does the autonomy go on the style of the investment itself? Because one of the things that seems to revamp Besmer is that the sorts of investments that it will make and has made, has evolved a lot of our time and constantly change. If I came as a new partner and I brought a late stage buyout type deal or something that really clearly wasn't like a venture style investment or something like that, what reaction would that be met with? How much are you pushing people to really pursue their own unique individual investment strategy versus conform to what the charity that is an LP of Besmer thinks that you guys do? I'm always interested in style drift and how much of that is good versus bad and how much the firm encourages versus doesn't. So how does Besmer manage that sort of thing?
  Speaker 4
  Patrick, I would say we encourage more autonomy than almost any other venture firm, both with respect to decision making and style. That could be a speculative seed investment in a team back of an Appgen all ([Time 0:17:01](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c3a10541-934e-42d1-ac10-a5df6028b3be))
    - **Note:** Encourages autonomy agency and provides a simple process for founders.
- How Roadmaps Guide Investment Decisions in Venture Capital
  Key takeaways:
  - The operating system has a component known as the roadmap
  - Roadmaps are themes or topics that partners are interested in and have done homework on
  - Investments are made based on these roadmaps
  - Sharing roadmaps with partners allows for informed investment decisions
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  There's an important part of the operating system we haven't talked about yet, which we call the roadmap internally. So it would be very odd behavior if I showed up to a partnership meeting and said, hey, everyone, I'm investing in a biotech company because the group knows I don't know a thing about biotech and they would think I'd lost my mind. The behavior we have here is roadmap based, which means every partner will pick up over time a number of essentially themes they're interested in. We call them roadmaps and we go off and do a bunch of homework on those themes typically before we make our first investment and we start talking to each other about them. At our off sites and other periodic meetings, we'll present a roadmap outside of the context of any investment. We'll say, gosh, I'm interested in vertical software. Here's what I'm seeing there, et cetera. And then when you bring in a company that's squirreling that roadmap, your partners know that you're within a lane that you've thought a lot about. Certainly somebody could branch into like a new style of investing. So let's say you wanted to do a ton of seed stage investing with a very high frequency, but you would typically present that to the partnership as a strategy first and have a fierce discussion on that and that strategy and then begin to execute on it. So it's not as if you're just showing up and saying, trust me, I'm doing something you've never seen before. It's going to work out. There's a little bit of preconditioning.
  Speaker 3
  What's shared in common amongst the best roadmaps that you've seen presented across your collective histories at Bessemer? What is it about the roadmaps that are really effective?
  Speaker 2
  I thought a lot about this because we did a retroanalysis of all of our best roadmaps, where they came from and what worked about them. Typically, I would say the best, but not all the best roadmaps, but most of them are positioned around some big change in the technology landscape. So cloud investing being probably most productive roadmaps starting 20 years ago. So they start with the tech change as opposed to starting with a problem space. So if you start with aging as a problem and you say, gosh, aging is really bad and mortality, that's Bummer, I'm going to go look for technologies to solve that problem. ([Time 0:19:02](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ec3479d4-f000-4dc0-8420-c53709ce393a))
    - **Note:** Start with tech change not a problem space. Decentralized structure gives more autonomy and scale.
- Honest Investment Memos at Bessemer: A Critical Insight
  Key takeaways:
  - Bessemer's investment memos are known to be honest
  - The investment memos are not meant to convince someone on what to do
  - A new associate at Bessemer noticed the honesty of the investment memos compared to her old firm
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I think there's a second element to it. And I'll tell you an anecdote I got from at the time, a young associate. And she had just joined the firm. And I was doing like a half an hour. Welcome to Bessemer. I hope you found where the bathroom is located introductory session. I asked her, is there anything different relative to what you expected now that you've been here like a month? And she said to me this thing that Shockingen, I've told the story many times, and she said to me, yeah, there is. I can't believe how honest the investment memos are at Bessemer. And I was like, what do you mean honest? And she had been at another investment firm before she joined us. And I asked her, did they lie? And then the investment memo is at your old firm, she said, no, no, it's just that she realized within just a few weeks, this, I think, really critical insight, which is that when we write these memos, we're not trying to convince somebody what to do. At our old firm, there's really like two people who kind of ran the investment committee. And the goal was to convince them to give you permission to make the investment. So like, yeah, you talk about some weaknesses or risks in your memos. But it was kind of like answering that silly interview question that you might get when you're interviewing for a job. And someone says, tell me about your weaknesses. They're like, oh, I work too hard. It's like a sort of a bullshit weakness that you're saying, because you have to have some weaknesses or risk, but it's not real. And in contrast, she said at Bessemer, it was very clear to her, people were writing in the memo what they really think, because not asking someone else to make the decision for them, they're explaining their decision. And the teams that work on investments at Bessemer are typically a partner and an associate and sometimes an analyst. So it's two or three people. ([Time 0:28:00](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4886b214-ab40-4c0b-8e57-2df8b93ffc51))
    - **Note:** Culture of honesty don’t try to make the investment seem good to IC but present the facts. Responsibility among partners and culture of open discourse.
- Assessing Capital Efficiency in Early Stage Startups
  Key takeaways:
  - Assessing capital efficiency at early stages involves looking for scrappiness and a willingness to do things that are not gold plated
  - Scrappiness in early stages can be demonstrated by low-key working environments
  - Fancy offices may not be necessary for attracting scrappy entrepreneurs
  - Capital efficiency at early stages may not be based on historical financials
  Transcript:
  Speaker 3
  Jeremy, when you're assessing capital efficiency, especially as you get earlier in the spectrum, and there's less historical financials, there's less to go on overall. Maybe there's not even a mature product in pricing yet. How do you think through that problem?
  Speaker 1
  At the earliest stages, capital efficiency shows up in just a scrappiness, a willingness to do things that are the opposite of gold plated. In fact, a slightly related anecdote. Within our partnership, as we've told you, we've got 20-ish partners and we all have different views, there's been a great debate over the years as to whether our offices should look like that of your typical dentist or if they should look like that of your typical fancy investment bank. I've always been a fan of the dentist's office, low-key, unordained, because when you work with scrappy entrepreneurs and they see you working in a scrappy environment, they're like, oh, okay, I get it. Of course, the counter is you want really fancy offices to show people how successful you've been so they want to work with you. But for me, I'm all about the scrappiness and the early stages. You can see that in just the environments, the people, the team hires, they're typically less experienced and risky or in cheaper hires. But if you get really talented people who are less experienced and risky early in their career, they end up growing into the next Toby Lootke to see if Shopify. I think too many entrepreneurs misunderstand the objective, which is like, how do you build something really great without burning lots and lots of money to do so? ([Time 0:36:19](https://share.snipd.com/snip/eef3a4be-df9b-4ca7-95e4-31159a43d184))
    - **Note:** Scrappy entrepreneurs who are relentlessly capital efficient.
- Path to Market Dominance: Lessons from Successful VMS Businesses
  Key takeaways:
  - Building a great business quickly is easier if you're going after a greenfield opportunity
  - Delivering software to an industry that's never had it before is the ideal setup for market leadership
  - Exceptions to greenfield opportunities may require a dramatically better or dramatically cheaper product for market leadership
  Transcript:
  Speaker 3
  Brian, on the go-to-market side of VMS businesses, talked about path to market dominance or market leadership. What have you seen the best in the world at accomplishing that do consistently well?
  Speaker 4
  Every story has its own aid to use in groceries. I think in general, it's much easier to build a great business quickly if you're going after a grain-filled opportunity. Shopify catering to online retailers who are coming online in a way that we've never seen before. Pro-core catering to construction companies that suddenly had internet on the job site and mobile devices for workers to interact. Being able to deliver software to an industry that's never had it before is the ideal setup for market leadership. Now, there are exceptions, and I give Kent a lot of credit for the toast investment because toast was attacking a market that was full event. At the time, you had NCRE, you had Micros, you had countless restaurant point of sale systems, so they did not have a greenfield opportunity. In those situations, what we've observed is the path to market leadership requires a dramatically better product, 10x better, or dramatically cheaper, 10x cheaper, in order to cut through the noise and drive that replacement cycle. It's not easy to do. Kent can tell you the toast story, but my understanding is they did both. ([Time 0:38:56](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fa4a93de-2fa6-46a2-a4d7-850952563fe1))
    - **Note:** Either enter a greenfield market or make something 10x better/cheaper
