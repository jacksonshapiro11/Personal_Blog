### Highlights

- Navigating Difficult Feedback and Building Trust
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I want them to tell me, like, what I really think I'm good at, but I'm not. He got some really hard feedback on that. And I think that it can hurt, you know, you go out there, you're very confident and you're very excited, especially in things you think you're good at. And then people tell you, like, this is a, you're really not that good at this. It stings. And I think you have to be able to sit with people and understand that, like, no matter what levels people reach their people, and like, some of these things are going to hurt. And so being able to present things in ways that are hard, but getting through sometimes some of the other characteristics that prevent feedback like this, you've got to push a little bit. And sometimes the conversations are pretty, they can be somewhat contentious, right? Like, I can say, hey, this is just what I found, and you get a lot of like pushback or defensiveness. And that's okay. You know, I can take that. It's not a big deal. But I think that also you have to have a great relationship for someone to feel comfortable, being able to be kind of not their best self with you, right, to be able to give you some hard responses, to be able to be a little brusque with you. And I can take that. And to me, that's a signal of trust, right? You can talk to me a certain way if you want to, but we're still going to have this conversation. It's not going to impact our relationship, and we're going to continue moving forward. But obviously, it's still in a respectful framework. It's just sometimes people respond in ways that aren't optimal, and there's no facade I'm expecting from them. ([Time 0:16:32](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8030a4bc-a5a1-48d2-9ab6-f69138081e25))
    - **Note:** Being all in or engaged setting high standards and realizing people have different goals job vs career and so they may not be as motivated. Getting anonymous 360 feedback from people to understand what’s really going on in your organization and with yourself. Challenging people directly but caring deeply.
- The Power of Shifting from Me vs. You to Us vs. the Problem
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Sure. I think that one of the best frameworks people can use, and I think people don't use, don't have hard conversations because they see them as being a conflict, right? It's going to be me versus you and it's going to be a conflict. So what I try to do is to say, rather than, let's just say Ted is the marketing department is missing, it's numbers. I don't want to say when Ted comes in, Ted, you're missing your numbers, right? Like, what's going on? I want us to, instead of being me versus you, I want to pull him to my side and be like, hey, this is us versus a problem. You can do this at home. You could do it at work. You could do it anywhere. And to be able to say, hey, Ted, I noticed that our numbers are, we're kind of missing here in the marketing department. Can we, like, let's do some problem solving around how we can really pull these up? So it's a we. You're intentionally pulling someone to your side. You're forming a collaboration against the problem. So rather than me and then you are the problem, it is I'm pulling you to my side of the table and it's us together versus this problem that we're going to talk about. And it is it's incredibly effective because it reduces defensiveness. It creates openness. It makes you more approachable. ([Time 0:23:35](https://share.snipd.com/snip/525eefb5-28ed-44e6-8da3-ede6401f823b))
    - **Note:** Reframe as us vs the problem not me vs you. Instead of underperforming say taking to the next level. Bad 10 minutes bad hour or bad day. Don’t let problems compound set a bar step into a role and be a beast.
- The Importance of Addressing Problems Early
  Key takeaways:
  - Collaboration and addressing problems early can save you a lot of trouble in the long run.
  - When facing potential danger, it is best to fight upfront rather than allow yourself to be taken to a secondary location.
  - Having conversations and collaborations instead of conflicts can be beneficial in various aspects of life, including business and relationships.

  Speaker 1
  So when I first was in grad school, my area of specialization was adult psychopathology and forensics. So I worked a long time in forensics, whether it was a bit in forensics, I should say, whether it was in like, you know, maximum security setting or evaluating people for like, you know, mental stay at the time of the offense to set up the insanity defense or mental time, mental stay at the time of the crime setting up for the insanity defense. So one of the things in forensics that they tell you, you know, just the good rule of thumb is that, hey, if you're ever walking along and, you know, somebody tries to kidnap you, pull you into a van or a truck or a car or whatever, your best chance is if you fight upfront, right? Like, this is the chance you have because once you go into that vehicle, wherever you are taken, wherever that secondary location is, you don't know what's going to happen and it will be worse, right? It will be worse. You can't predict it. You don't know it. It's just, it's a bad thing. So you want to do everything you can to not get in that vehicle. And if it ends up your, if it ends your life, it, if it has a tragic outcome, so be it, but it is going to be more pleasant and better for you than ever getting in that car. And I really thought about that a lot because having the conversations early, having the collaborations rather than conflict early, addressing problems early in your business, in your life, in your relationships, whatever saves you so much on the back end that you can never predict. ([Time 0:32:45](https://share.snipd.com/snip/778805f7-851d-488d-aa0a-2147e25fd809))
    - **Note:** When you’re getting attacked or kidnapped the best solution is to fight not get in the car even if you die it might be better in the forensics field. This is true with relationships and work. Don’t wait attack the problem as early as possible it will never get less painful. The longer the wait the worse. Humans are the greatest drivers a limiters of where they end up so transcend these imaginary rules. People into years long ruts where they bound their lives instead. If you don’t understand why someone else is doing something and you’re not you need to look at your internal blocks and aim to move them so you can transcend yourself. You’re in this tunnel first you need to recognize then next you need to make changes. Often you’re unaware of unknown unknowns so you need to expand your information intake and social horizons. If you’re happy and comfortable you can’t transcend yourself you should pull from many domains to grow. How do we get out of cognitive ruts by diversifying our inputs. What’s challenging you personally and professionally to push yourself to levels you didn’t realize. A lot of this is taking and evolving perspective.
