- Make yourself a big target for luck. A professor at grinnel read about vacuum tubes in the newspaper on 1948 and asked intel to send him a few. 18 kids in his physics class learned about the transitor one of which was Bob noyce who was a gifted rebel almost thrown out of college despite being a genius. Bob noyce had a passion for tinkering with a rebelous streak. He almost got kicked out of school for stealing a pig but his professor got it down to a suspension. He had a very good engaging conversation demeanor when you talked with him you were the only person in the world. He was very charismatic. All these chance events the transitior at grinnel a small school because the professor knew the guy who invented it then keeping him in school after he committed a felony. This got him into MIT eventually created intel can’t connect the dots looking forward. He was a well rounded guy on the swim team in the choir constantly inventing very high agency.

- The Danger of Being Too Introspective
  Summary:
  The insight highlights the danger of being too introspective, as exemplified by William Shockley, a brilliant yet idiotic individual with zero people skills.
  Shockley's lack of charisma, pessimism, and envy towards others led to a tragic and sad life, as he was threatened by the achievements of people around him and could not overcome self-pity and envy.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  He's the most intelligent yet idiotic person you will ever come across. Unbelievably brilliant, brilliant inventor, brilliant physicist, zero people skills at all in the way he treated people around him. They called his personality reverse charisma. If you plot Bob Noyce's personality and William Shockley's On A Spectrum, they're almost at opposite ends. And this is the danger of being, I think, for ex -watcher -fronchrometer, is almost too introspective. They're too lost in their own mind. So I'm just going to give you some highlights about like how he viewed other humans, the way he some of the stuff he did, and it just his his his life is just tragic. It's very sad. And so he says just another warning that the deepest peasant pessimism and general lack of admiration for the human race and myself are probably with me for keeps. These are all quotes from his biography. Be seen as smart as him, seem to frighten him. Listen to how he describes his own children and his first wife. In terms of my own capacities, my children represent a very significant regression. My first wife, their mother, had not as high an academic achievement standing as I had. One of the worst traits the Shockley has is he was threatened by the achievements of other people. He lies. Said that envy and self -pity have no utility. You have to cure yourself of self -pity and envy, according to Charlie Munger. And this guy just couldn't get over it.

    - **Note:** Noyce Doesn’t take the job at bell labs goes to a smaller semiconductor company, or he can make more advancements and have more agency. when Shockley leaves the labs to form his own company Bob flies out despite having two kids to beg for the job and get it the same day. Shockley had negative charisma worried people were smarter than him and couldn’t take it. very envious and this was his downfall. He was a terrible people person despite being incredibly smart. he tries to kill himself because he can’t live up to the achievements of others. Shockley could not manage people and would always take credit for himself. Working for Shockley made them realize what they are doing here why don’t they go out on their own because they do a better job. They got Bob at 29 to lead the group and form Fairchild semi this becomes the traitorous 8. They decide to go to silicon value and computing is coming into existence with the space race right place and time.
- Innovating the Production Process
  Summary:
  In the early days, the manual production of transistors involved tedious and frustrating labor resulting in a high failure rate.
  While observing this, Noyce realized the need for a better solution. Instead of the primitive process of cutting and wiring individual transistors, he proposed placing them all on a single silicon chip without wires.
  This idea of integrated circuits was also being explored by other engineers like Jack Kilby who was working at Texas Instruments.

  Looked like slightly sunnier versions of garment sweatshops. You would see rows of people hunch over work tables squinting through microscopes, doing the most tedious and frustrating sort of manual labor, cutting layers of apart with diamond Cutters, picking up the little rectangles on them with tweezers, trying to attach wires to them, dropping them, rummaging around on the floor to find them again, swearing, muttering, Climbing back up to their chairs, rubbing their eyes, squinting back through the microscopes, and driving themselves crazy some more. Now this is the crazy thing. This is the beginning of one of the most important and issues that ever exist. And what they are producing had a 50 to 90% failure rate. That is bananas. Anywhere from 50 to 90% of the transistors produced would turn out to be defective. And so, noise is examining what they're doing. It's like there has to be a way better Noyce had figured out a solution. There was something primitive about cutting individual transistors out of sheets of silicon and then wiring them back together in various series. Why not put them all on a single piece of silicon without wires? Noyce realized that he was not the only engineer thinking along these lines, but he had never even heard of Jack Kilby. So Kilby at the time was a 36 year old engineer working for Texas Instruments in Dallas, Texas. ([Time 0:24:30](https://share.snipd.com/snip/59ba4764-9a8c-4d12-a9fd-f851324b12cf))
    - **Note:** Transistors were being assembled by hand and had a failure rate between 50 and 90%. Bob had an idea to improve production by putting them all on one chip. Noyce invented the integrated circuit or the microchip this allowed you to take a room of compute and shrink it to the size of a playing card opening up everything imaginable new emergent problem space. They turned their initial investment into $3 million of Fairchild stock and took the semi conductors from nothing to 130 million in revenue every year. Each person of the 8 got 250k 20x yearly salary. They just enjoyed electrical engineering didn’t think anything would come of it. Noyce hired smart young phds have them total agency to create what they wanted out of this came many defectors which led to the real birth of Silicon Valley. Starting a new semi company was the new frontier like cars or oil had been. They gave themselves over to the technology like a religious mission
- Innovative Leadership at Intel
  Summary:
  At Intel, employees are encouraged to take initiative by deflating one ball, putting it in their pocket, and grabbing another to run with, symbolizing the idea of efficiency and innovative thinking.
  Andy Grove embodied the company's principle that with more freedom comes more responsibility. He introduced performance ratings resembling traditional grading scales to assess employee performance.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  The principles of Intel were explained via the Socratic method at management seminars by Intel's number three man, Andy Grove. And so there's an example in the essay or the article of the way Grove taught and then his personality. I'm just gonna read the whole thing you. I just maybe laugh. So Grove would say, How would you sum up the Intel approach? Many hands would go up and Grove would choose one and the employee would say, at Intel, you don't wait for someone else to do it. You take the ball yourself and you run with it and Grove would say, wrong. At Intel, you take the ball yourself and you let the air out of the ball, and you fold up the ball and you put it in your pocket. Then you take another ball and you run with it. And when you've crossed the goal, you take the second ball out of your pocket and reinflate it and score 12 points instead of six. Grove was the most colorful person at Intel. He was in his mid at the time. He was the epitome of the religious principle, the Intel religious principle, that the greater the freedom, the greater the obligation to exercise discipline. And then it goes into some of his managerial contributions to Intel. Grove was the inspiration for performance ratings. We're kind of like a report card. And so all the employees are graded. There's, let's see, five different ways you can be graded. Sounds a lot like A, B, C, D and F. ([Time 0:43:27](https://share.snipd.com/snip/336c5cbe-9bf2-4723-b2fe-9966bf2ee9b9))
    - **Note:** They decided they want to go out on their own and form Intel at 41. They went after the memory market, which was a backwater and after three years had 66 million in sales very successful. Very egalitarian culture. No matter how old you were, you can have an important decision and even Bob had to attend the culture sessions they had regularly which were run by Andy Grove. Bob had an old beat up desk he never got replaced and sat with everyone new employees saw they had newer desks than him helped understand the culture well. High agency very meritocratic and pressed people to think differently. Grove developed his own rating system and performance management that helped propel the company and guide workforce with good feedback. If you’re ambitious and hard-working, you wanna be told the truth school grades had become bastardized because failing students would be sent to Vietnam so everyone passed. Average players want to be left alone good players want to be coached and great players want to be told the truth - nick Saban.
- Educate the Market for New Products
  Summary:
  When introducing a radical innovation, the market may be resistant due to the idea being far from the norm.
  Educating the market is crucial to success in such cases. Intel founders realized the necessity of educating the market about the microprocessor to overcome confusion and fear.
  They took the lead in conducting seminars and workshops, becoming educators themselves.
  This strategy was also understood by Sony's founder, Akio Morita, emphasizing the importance of preparing customers before expecting success in the marketplace.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And so even though I read that book over seven years ago, there's still an idea in that book that I've never forgotten. I think it's really important. It's the idea that you have for a new product, you have to educate the market. And that's what Bob Noyce, Andy Grove and Gordon Moore realized with the invention of the microprocessor. It says when you're trying to convince an audience to accept a radical innovation, almost by definition, the idea is so far from the status quo that many people simply cannot get their Minds around it. They quickly discovered that the marketplace wasn't just confused by the concept of the microprocessor, but was actually frightened by its implication. Many of my engineering friends scoffed at it as if it was a gimmick. Their solution? The market had to be educated and this is what's so fascinating. The best founders know that they are the ones that have to take the lead on this. At one point, Intel was conducting more seminars and workshops on how to use the microprocessor than the local junior college's total catalog of courses. Bob Noyce, Gordon Moore and Andy Grove became part of a traveling educational roadshow. They became educators and it worked. Another founder who understood this at a fundamental level was the founder of Sony, Akio Marita. This is what he said in his autobiography. One must prepare the groundwork among the customers before you can expect success in the marketplace. ([Time 0:49:20](https://share.snipd.com/snip/95be47aa-ffe7-4738-90e7-6f616e804282))
    - **Note:** Intel had another act when they invented the microprocessor, which was something very new. In his 50s, Bob realized invention was a young man’s game and moved to chairman allowing Moore to become CEO. The microchip was such a new product that the market needed to be educated and Bob Gordon, Moore, Andy Grove were the ones out in the market teaching people they had more classes than a junior college. Constantly on the road education the market. You must prepare the groundwork in the market before you can sell educating the market takes time. Education takes time and you must educate the customers on what it is and why it’s good.
