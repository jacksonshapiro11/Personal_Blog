- Following Your Inner Voice in Decision-Making
  Summary:
  In making decisions, it is crucial to trust your instincts and follow your inner voice rather than conforming to prevailing opinions or seeking approval from others.
  Going against popular beliefs in business may lead to criticism and doubt from not only competitors and the media but also friends and family. This approach requires trusting in something, be it gut feeling, destiny, or karma, as the future is always uncertain.
  Success often entails making decisions based on what you envision for your life rather than succumbing to external pressures or consensus.

  Speaker 1
  Okay, what path before you, Getty? What do you want to do? On the left hand side, we got, hey, we're going to sell everything. You know, the world is ending, but at least we'll have a little bit of money. The right is I'm going to double down. I'm going to make this list of my life's work. I'm not only not going to sell my oil wells, I'm going to invest more money in This is no different than when Steve Jobs said in that commencement address that you can't connect the dots Looking forward. You can only connect the dots looking backwards. So you have to trust in something. You have to trust in your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. But what Rockefeller knew, what Getty knew, what Steve Jobs knew, you have to put your faith in something. The future is always unknown and so he says, in business it is never easy to go against the beliefs and attitudes held by the majority. This is exactly what he's doing at this point in his life. The businessman who moves counter to the tide of prevailing opinion must expect to be obstructed, derided and damned. And it's one thing to say for his competitors or people the media or people he doesn't know to doubt him. It's his friends and family are doing it as well. My friends and acquaintances felt my buying spree would prove a fatal mistake. And so this idea to listen to your own inner voice to make decisions based on what you want your life to be, not with the consensus or the prevailing opinion at the time or your friends or Acquaintances is so important because he didn't make his first billion in 1930.

Doesn’t sell out double downs. handful of decisions that shape our lives and we never have the data. We just need to trust our gut. Don’t worry about pessimistic young people it’ll always be hard, but the best time to start is now there will always be pessimists who say you’re getting in at the wrong time and there are always problems but he believes in extreme ownership and doesn’t believe in excuses. Optimism is a moral duty and pessimism is ever present in history, but not a good bet to win. Many people give up before they start those who were successful. Did the job in front of them with everything in hand deep focus on the task at hand.
- Ten Principles for Business Success
  Summary:
  The key insights from this excerpt highlight ten principles for business success: 1.
  Choose a field one knows well, 2. Focus on producing better goods for more people, 3.
  Practice thrift and economic discipline, 4.
  Avoid forced growth or blind expansion, 5.
  Maintain close supervision over the business, 6. Constantly seek ways to improve products and invest in technology, 7. Repay borrowed money promptly, 8. Look for untapped markets, 9. Honor guarantees to build a reliable reputation, and 10.
  Use wealth to improve living conditions and reinvest in products and services.
  These principles emphasize the importance of knowledge, discipline, innovation, reliability, and social responsibility in achieving business success.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  There's 10 different things. Number one, choose a field which he knows and understands. So figure out where your circle of competence is. Number two, you should never lose sight of the central aim for all businesses, which is to produce more and better goods to more people. Number three, a sense of thrift is essential for success in business. The businessman must discipline himself to practice economy wherever possible. Number four, be always be on guard against the temptation to over -expand or launch expansion programs blindly. Forced growth can be fatal to any business new or old. I got to repeat that. There's a great line from David Packard, the founder of HP, where he says that more companies die from indigestion than starvation and I think that's exactly what Getty's getting to There for number four. Number five, a businessman must run his own business. He cannot expect his employees to think or do as well as he can. He must maintain close and constant supervision over the entire business. Number six, the businessman must be constantly alert for new ways to improve his products and services and increase his production and sales. So really what he's saying is you should invest in technology. That is something that the great entrepreneurs before Getty, during Getty, and after Getty all believed. In fact, if you read Andrew Carnegie's autobiography, it was probably published 80 years before this book came out, or maybe 60 years, something like that. But one of the main lessons when you study the early days, as Carnegie built his steel empire, there's a theme in that book, which is invest in technology, the savings compound. It gives you an advantage over slowing moving competitors and can be the difference between a profit and a loss. Number seven, borrowed money must always be promptly repaid. Nothing will destroy a career faster than a bad credit rating. Number eight, a businessman must constantly seek untapped or under exploitedexploited markets. Number 9. Guarantees should always be honored in the customer's favor. The business that is known to be completely reliable will have little difficulty filling its order books and keeping them filled. And number 10. No matter how many millions in individual masses, if he is in business, he must always consider his wealth as a means for improving living conditions everywhere. And number 10 is just a lesson that his father taught him. The fact that, you know, don't just sit on a bunch of gold coins like your Scrooge McDuck. You have more money than you'll ever need. Reinvest that into making more products and services that make other people's lives better. ([Time 0:24:08](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9d42760d-1f52-4ded-8a47-e4772ff96a29))
    - **Note:** Rules for business 1. stay inside circle of competence 2. cost conscious 3. don’t over grow yourself for a lack of stability 4. aim of business to produce new and better things for people 5. See from the front 6. Invest in technology 7. Repay borrow money quickly 8. Business man must always seek untapped markets 9. Guarantees must always be honored in customers favor 10. Wealth is a means to making others lives better reinvest your money to make the world better.
- Value in Waste Management and Millionaire Mentality
  Summary:
  By analyzing waste baskets and sorting out reusable items, a company discovered it was wasting over $30,000 annually.
  Moreover, a junior executive with a millionaire mentality saved his company over $25,000 per year by implementing a small productivity shortcut, showcasing talent and ownership mindset beyond his position.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So the waste baskets in its administrative offices so each night for a week They actually had a team of workers come in empty the waste and then they'd sort out the usable items and the Company property Which had actually been tossed into them. So like paper clips rubber bands erasers, stuff like that, stuff that could be reused. They took an inventory that's everything in the trash, and they multiplied that total by 52 to estimate what this was costing them for a year. And they figured out that more than $30 ,000 was being wasted each year. And so then Getty has an example that happened inside of one of his own companies. He says a bright junior executive, this guy had the millionaire mentality, the founder mentality. He devised a shortcut in a production operation, which saved half a cent per unit, but added up to a total yearly savings over $25 ,000, which is remarkable, is again, this is how they Reveal themselves to you, right? This talent is in your organization and there's clever ways in which they reveal that they are possessed of more talent and derived in the position that they currently have, because This guy winds up saving the company $25 ,000 a year. That was more than twice of his annual salary. This man quite definitely has what I term the millionaire mentality. He is the ownership mentality, the founder mentality, right? He is incidentally no longer a junior executive. ([Time 0:31:53](https://share.snipd.com/snip/67de559c-100d-4c67-9da2-3240122658b2))
    - **Note:** Leverage the power of your organization. He had a site with a lot of issues and the guy running. It said that he wasn’t incentivize properly and then Getty gave him a percent of the profits and the place ran perfectly since. There are entrepreneurs then group 2 people who need to right motivating to do great stuff then groups 3 and 4 are mail clerks. They have one year experience from a 10 year career avoid these people. Think small you can save a few drops of paint but that could save you 50 K a year. Rockefeller turned one drop of solder into hundreds of thousands of savings across his lifetime. Warns against organization man he’s a slave driver to his subordinates and ass kisser his boss. Always thinking for the long term. He owns doesn’t trade. Want to own don’t trade.
- Key Leadership Lessons from Getty
  Summary:
  Leadership lessons from Getty include leading by example, taking full responsibility for actions, being willing to do tasks yourself, being fair but firm with subordinates, and providing praise in public and criticism in private.
  Getty emphasizes the importance of extreme ownership, avoiding excuses and pampering, and maintaining a professional distance from subordinates. These lessons stem from his experiences in the oil fields and serve as valuable traits for both executives and individuals.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  This is his, he make, he loves making lists, which I love as well. So this is Getty's five lessons on leadership. And these leadership traits are not only for your executive team, but also for yourself. Number one, example is the best means to instruct or inspire others. Number two, a good executive accepts full responsibility for the actions of the people under him. How many times? Repeat that over and over again is every single essay, you must have extreme ownership, you must take responsibility for your actions. He talks about people that make excuses. He uses different words, but he essentially says, he's like, the people that make excuses are just losers, they're never going to do anything. Number three, the best leader never asked anyone under him to do anything that he is unwilling to do himself. One of the things that Getty prides himself is that on and on. In an oil he can do every single job. He knows his business from A to Z, therefore there's no problem he can't solve. Number four, the man in charge must be fair but firm with his subordinates. He does not pamper them and he always bears in mind that familiarity breeds contempt. He believes that you should treat them fairly, that you hold them to high standards, that you don't pamper them, but you don't become friends with them. He does not believe that leads to a good outcome. Number five, praise should always be given in public and criticism should always be delivered in private. And what I love is he makes this list as like a summary for his experiences. And then he summarizes the summary. So he says, I learned my own lessons in leadership many years ago in the tough, no nonsense school provided by the oil fields. ([Time 0:35:37](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6beca2f4-f664-4b72-aeb2-45f624d1134b))
    - **Note:** Traits for leaders 1. Lead by example 2. Take extreme ownership and responsibility of the job 3. Never ask anyone for something you wouldn’t do and know business a-z 4. Be fair but firm don’t be a dick nor their best friend 5. Praise in public criticize in private. Best boss knows the business better than anyone and trust their workers. Good boss must communicate clearly and quickly. Time is money must get point across well clear thinking plus clear writing. Frugality among leaders. Cost conscious is an ingrained belief.
- Maintaining Temperament for Success in Business
  Summary:
  The key to success in business is to maintain a calm temperament and avoid panicking in the face of inevitable problems and stress.
  This control over emotions allows individuals to make rational decisions and avoid being defeated by stress or panic. By staying composed, one can navigate challenges like a person who has fallen overboard in a lake, ensuring they can swim to shore or be rescued.
  This ability to control one's temperament is crucial for building a successful career in business, beyond just possessing ordinary intelligence.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Another thing that can negate brilliance is the fact that you just don't have the right temperament. You get when something bad happens, you panic, you get scared. So something that Getty preaches over and over again, and Buffett says this as well, is that you have to stay calm, you cannot panic. And he was actually getting this advice as a young man from an older businessman, and this was the older businessman had told him, because problems are obviously inevitable, trouble, Stress, all that is inevitable. And so he says, always think of yourself as a man who has just fallen overboard in the middle of a lake. If you keep your wits about you, you can always swim to shore, or at least float until someone fishes you out. But if you lose your head in panic, you're finished. You're drowned. That's very similar to when Buffett says that, you know, ordinary intelligence not being an absolute moron, like that's table stakes. But once, if you have at least ordinary intelligence, what then you need to build a successful career in business is you need temperament to control the urges that actually get other People into trouble and so other people let stress defeat them other people start to panic other people are incapable of staying calm and making the right decision and we already saw That geddy developed that talent earlier in life when he was talking about the fact that imagine being a young man with not a lot of resources. You think you hit pay dirt, you have all these wells producing thousands of barrels of oil today, and then suddenly one of your unknown and unnamed big competitors completely squeezes You and cuts off all your ability to sell your oil. ([Time 0:40:57](https://share.snipd.com/snip/45a56b68-6c3f-4315-9e64-65dcb7cfe368))
    - **Note:** Problems are inevitable and at these times you need to be calm under pressure because if you lose your head, you’re fucked. Panick leads to death but at least have the wherewithal to stay calm. People wanted him to panic sell, but he kept his head and made a ton of money on the situation. No work about work just work. Hated writing memos and writing procedures. Thinks MBA’s, who learn all these admin skills are useless, and he learned on the fields which he thinks is the only way to learn. Less overhead the better. Exces need to get their hands dirty. They need to lead from the front not their office. Primary function of management is to achieve results through people. Master of psychology and common sense he learned from working with others to tell people the truth and get point across without hurting feelings. Always learning from older people business are effective problem solving machines. The occasional problem is good to keep people on their toes the perfect business doesn’t exist problems are inevitable
- Effective Management through Applied Psychology
  Summary:
  Management involves obtaining results through people, utilizing common sense, psychology, and indirection.
  By addressing issues with applied psychology, such as holding daily conferences to address tardiness or charging an executive for misappropriation of company property, management can positively influence employees and improve morale. By incorporating calmness, problem-solving, and learning from successful businessmen, one can develop effective business leadership.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And you just see that he uses a lot of what I would call common sense and psychology and indirection to get his point across without harming his relationship with his employees. He's really, really good at that. In fact, I love his definition of how he thinks about management. He says, the primary function of management is to obtain through people. The primary function of management is to obtain results through people. And so he gives a great example of how he does this. And again, he just, it's like how to win friends and influence people. He understood how to influence and to build relationships with his subordinates, with people that work for him. And so he talks about in one of his companies that employee morale was sagging and he soon found out why. He said several executives had gotten into their heads that they could arrive for work anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour late each morning. Naturally, this did not set very well with the rank and file workers who were required to punch time clocks and were docked pay if they were tardy. I've always felt that bad management psychology is best countered by forcefully applied psychology. Listen to what he does here. It's very fascinating. I did not waste time issuing threats of disciplinary action. I simply announced that I would now be holding daily conferences at which I expected all management personnel to be present. And the conference would begin 45 minutes before the start of the regular working day. I lost a bit of sleep in the next two weeks or so, but I won a major battle. My executives got the idea. There was no more habitual tardiness, and worker morale was restored. And so then Getty provides another example of, hey, we need to meet bad management psychology with forcefully positive applied psychology. And so he says, I learned an executive had taken some company owned lumber and nails with which he constructed a dog kennel in his backyard. I felt that he'd set a dangerous precedent which could lead to all kinds of trouble and cause losses to soar if employees learned that he'd gotten away with this. Since he was a valuable man, I did not want to fire him relied on another applied psychology strategy. I sent the man a pleasantly worded memo, asking for a detailed inventory of the material he had taken and saying, I would have it appraised and the value charged against his salary. The inventory was prepared, the total value was found to be about $4 and this sum was duly against his pay. I got the point across." This message spread throughout the company and the workers realizing that not even executives could get away with appropriating company property took the Lesson to heart themselves. And something that reappears throughout this book, it also is mentioned multiple times in his autobiography that he's really helped out not only like building, you know, mentors In historical context by voraciously reading history, but there's all these like older businessmen that help him out throughout his entire career. And he learns a very valuable lesson on business leadership from an older, more successful at the time, older, more successful businessmen. And it is related to this idea that, you know, you have to stay calm, you don't panic, and that business is problem, so the best companies are just effective problem -solving machines. ([Time 0:47:47](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a1e6a6e5-f443-4368-a816-556b2c16b05f))
    - **Note:** Using psychology to get his point across well without offending.
- Embrace Challenges in Business
  Summary:
  Challenges and crises in business are inevitable and essential for growth.
  A successful business leader remains calm and views setbacks as opportunities to improve and grow. Perfection does not exist in business, and a stagnant status quo leads to complacency, stagnation, and eventual collapse.
  Embracing challenges, constantly seeking improvements, and being prepared to clean up messes are vital for a business's success and longevity.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I remember learning as a youth an invaluable lesson from a man who even then had extensive business holdings and who would later become one of America's wealthiest industrialists. I ran into him one day in the lobby of a Chicago hotel. How are things going? I asked him. Not good. Terrible, in fact. He replied with a One of my companies has been shoved into a tight corner by the competition. Another is operating in the red and a third doesn't have the cash to meet its short term debts that fall due this month. So a young Getty's like, what the hell are you smiling about? What's happening? And Getty asked him like, you don't see, you're not acting like you're worried. What's going on? Hell, Paul, I'm not the least bit worried, he answered. To tell you the truth, I needed something like this to get me up on my toes. Everything has been going entirely too smoothly for far too long. An occasional crisis is good for a businessman. There's no better exercise for him than to have a few messes to clean up every now and then. And this is the punchline, the perfect does not exist. The perfect business does not exist. Snags, difficulties, and crisis crop up in every business. The truly great leader views reverses calmly and coolly. He is fully aware that they are bound to occur occasionally and he refuses to be unnerved by them. And so as you and I discussed when we went over J. Paul Getty's autobiography, he never retired. Like he worked until the day he died. And one of the reasons I think, in addition to him being completely obsessed and workaholic and just completely dedicated to what he was doing, I really think that he believed that you Should treat your business as like this living, breathing, constantly changing thing. And so there's one paragraph that really illustrates his management style and the way he ran his business. The concept that any status quo was perfect and permanent, that one must under no circumstances raise questions, voice doubts, or seek improvements can only produce complacency, Then stagnation and finally collapse. There is always something wrong everywhere. ([Time 0:50:48](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b434d2d7-8e79-4292-aacf-7913cb184249))
    - **Note:** Crisis are good to test your faith. Always look for problems there inevitable and soluable.
- Non-conformity Leads to Success in Business
  Summary:
  The truly successful businessman is a dissenter, a rebel who constantly seeks new ways, while conformists fall into mediocrity.
  Successful entrepreneurs like John D. Rockefeller and Howard Hughes embraced non-conformity, understanding that the majority is not always right. The conformist mentality fails to grasp the opportunities available to the imaginative individualist.
  Strong personalities relying on their judgment excel in business, understanding each situation is unique.
  The successful businessman is a well-rounded leader who values individualism and honesty, traits that define true worth.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  The successful entrepreneur, the leader, the innovator is the exceptional man. He is not a conformist, except in his adherence to his own ideals and his own beliefs. You will find the conformist, the organization man, in an ever -increasing number in the business world today. He believes that conformity is essential for success in his career. One of these types was complaining to me that he wasn't getting ahead fast enough and asked me if I could offer any advice. How can I achieve success in wealth and business, he asked. How can I make a million dollars? I can't give you any surefire formulas, I replied. But I'm certain of one thing. You'll go much farther if you stop trying to look and act and think like everyone else. The conformist only demonstrates that he is unimaginative, un -enterprising, and mediocre. In contrast, the successful businessman's non -conformity is most obvious and evident in the manner and methods of business operations and activities. These will be unorthodox in the sense that they are radically unlike those of his less imaginative and less successful competitors. Often, his innate impatience with the futility of superficial conventions and dogma of all kinds will manifest itself in varying degrees of eccentricity. And so he lists examples of other great entrepreneurs that he studies that had these traits. He talks about John D. Rockefeller. He talks about Howard Hughes. He talks about Bernard Baruch. He talks about Conrad Hilton. He says the people that fall into conformity, they make a massive mistake. They fall prey to a fundamental fallacy, the notion that the majority is automatically invariably right. Such is hardly the case. The majority is by no means omniscient just because it is the majority. In fact, this is an incredible line. In fact, I found that the line which divides majority opinion from mass hysteria is often so fine as to be virtually invisible. The note I jotted down, this is a note to myself. Think for yourself. Don't look around. Look in. Don't look around. Look in. The truly successful businessman is essentially a dissenter, a rebel who is seldom, if ever, satisfied with the status quo. He creates wealth by constantly seeking and often finding new and better ways to do and make things. In business, the mystique of conformity is sapping the dynamic individualism that is the most priceless quality and executive our businessmen can possibly possess. There are many pressures that force the young man of today to be a conformist. He is bombarded from all sides by arguments. He does not understand that the arguments are those of the almost -wears and the never -will -be's who want him as company to share the misery of their frustrations and failures. Conforming keeps him a second -stream player. By conforming, he misses the limitless opportunities which today present themselves to the imaginative individualist. I want security, he declares. It is a confession of weakness and cowardice. The men who will make their marks in commerce, industry, and finance are the ones with free -willing imaginations and strong, highly individualistic personalities. They rely on their own judgment rather than on surveys, studies, and committee meetings. They know that every business situation is different, from the next, and that no thousand volumes could ever contain enough rules to cover all contingencies. The successful businessman is no narrow specialist. He knows and understands all aspects of his business. He can spot a production bottleneck as quickly as he can in accounting error. The successful businessman is a leader who solicits opinion and advice from his subordinates, but makes the final decisions, gives the orders, and assumes the responsibility for Whatever happens. I've said it before and I'll say it again, there is a fantastic demand for such men in business today. The non -conformist, the leader and the originator, has an excellent chance to make his fortune in the business world. To be truly rich a man must live by his own values. It has always been my contention that an individual who can be relied upon to be himself and to not conform and to be honest unto himself can be relied upon in every other way. He places value on himself and his principles. And that, in the final analysis, is the measure of the true worth of any man. ([Time 0:55:29](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d21c3d82-40f1-4a37-af43-00b15939de2b))
    - **Note:** You can’t be an organization man you must be a non conformist blaze your own trail. Dint look around look in. Great quote about being yourself and not conforming. Read it or listen. Exceptional vs organization man.
