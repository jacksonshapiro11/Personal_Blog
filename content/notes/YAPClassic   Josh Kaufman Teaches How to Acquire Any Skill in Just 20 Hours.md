  I always found that hours zero to four or five are the frustration barrier. Like that's the worst part of the whole process. You're just frustrated. You can't do it. You know, you can't do it. Something starts to change between hours four and six, where you start to see yourself being able to perform in a way that you've never been able to perform before. And that's where things start to get really interesting. And then by and there's there's some variation here, but between hours 10 to 20, for me, two things happen. One is that you know you're a lot more competent now than you were when you like the improvement is night and day clear. And that's also where I find the frustration really to a great extent goes away. So continuing to practice after that point is way easier than it was at the beginning. Like you've reached a basic level of competence. You know what you're doing. You're no longer so confused. You're in a place where you're still making mistakes, but you also know enough about what you're doing that you can notice when you make a mistake and then correct it. And it's that part of the process, like having a certain level of skill, having a lack of frustration and being able to self correct as you practice, that's what gets you from pretty good to really good over a longer period of time. But it's that early critical period that really makes or breaks the skill to begin with. ([Time 0:23:37](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8c0390a3-e5f1-4210-915a-3084e6c98191))
    - **Note:** You reach a level when you’re not clueless. You make mistakes you know when you make mistakes and why and you start to build confidence. Having the ability to push through the frustration once you reach base competence and self correct separates good and great.
