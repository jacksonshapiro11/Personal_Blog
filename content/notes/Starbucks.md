- Creating a Successful Business Without Debt
  Summary:
  The speaker acquired six Starbucks stores and rebranded them as the Starbucks corporation, while the original Starbucks owners rebranded as Pete's. Despite facing rejection from majority of investors during fundraising, the speaker raised $1.6 million with 242 investors.
  The decision to acquire Pete's stores with a six to one debt to equity ratio put Starbucks in a corner with high debt service payments restricting innovation and risk-taking. Consequently, Starbucks avoided taking on debt due to the speaker's childhood experiences, leading to the company trying various innovative strategies over the next 40 years to become the successful business it is today.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 3
  We bought the six Starbucks stores. We had the three old children alleys and there were two stores under construction. So at the end of the calendar year, we had 11 stores and 100 employees in 1987.
  Speaker 5
  All in the Northwest. Yeah. Meanwhile, the original Starbucks folks, they've now gone down to California.
  Speaker 8
  They went to California.
  Speaker 5
  When did Pete's open coffee bars?
  Speaker 2
  Many, many years later.
  Speaker 8
  So they, you weren't competing right away. No, no.
  Speaker 1
  But this is one of the great observations David Iljournale buys the Starbucks stores. Rebrand's Iljournale incorporated as the Starbucks corporation. Yeah. And the original Starbucks buys, you know, had owned Pete's and now needs a new name. So it rebrand the company Pete's. So Pete's was actually Starbucks. Starbucks was actually Iljournale. Yes. It's amazing. Some stats just for listeners to understand the gravity of this situation. For the initial 1.6 million that you raised for Iljournale, you talked to 242 investors, 217 of which said no. So anybody who's griping about their fundraising journey, you know, those are rookie numbers.
  Speaker 3
  Remember, but you asked me a question earlier about what did the years at Xerox teach me?
  Speaker 2
  So the rejection I was going through, the Italians turned me down.
  Speaker 3
  People in the US turned me down.
  Speaker 2
  Nobody would believe in the idea. It was like I was co-calling again at Xerox.
  Speaker 1
  The other thing that is worth pointing out is the Starbucks. This company with the six stores, when they bought Pete's with that six to one debt to equity ratio, basically backed themselves into a corner where now they had these big debt service Payments to make. There was really no risk they could take or innovation that they could do because the whole business needed to spit out a certain amount of cash every month so they could pay down the debt. And so when you're in that situation, Starbucks in the 40 years ahead from this point in the story has tried all sorts of things. It has tried all sorts of crazy things to become the business that it is today. And when you first created this combined company, you were pretty religious about no debt.
  Speaker 4
  No debt. I want any debt again because of my childhood. ([Time 0:38:34](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a7beb516-a5bd-4058-ab2d-6560f4551798))
    - **Note:** Learned how to deal with rejection and push through it. Never used debt. The importance of the third place and using the cup as free marketing.
- Building a Company on Human Values
  Summary:
  Starbucks faced financial turmoil despite being a prominent and successful company due to an unexpected lack of cash flow.
  To recover, the focus shifted to the importance of humanity and the people within the organization. Starbucks rebuilt its foundation by emphasizing the human aspect, understanding that the company's success was rooted in being performance-driven through a human lens.
  By engaging with store managers and employees directly, Starbucks demonstrated its commitment to its people.
  A significant event in New Orleans post-Katrina showcased Starbucks' dedication to the community through 50,000 hours of community service, business restoration tutorials, and engaging speeches, reinforcing the core value of being a company built on humanity.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  You say that, we were trying to save Starbucks. And in my head, I always thought, what couldn't have been that bad? This is big, successful company, it's fast-growing, it's profitable. And then I read, you were seven months from being insolvent.
  Speaker 3
  So we had, we didn't have enough cash.
  Speaker 2
  Comcepts, we never had negative coms in the history of Starbucks.
  Speaker 1
  So negative, I didn't- Every single quarter was better than 12 months.
  Speaker 4
  Never had a negative com month in my history of the company. I didn't understand it, such an anomaly. So we close all those stores, and then you gotta decide, okay, how do we turn it?
  Speaker 2
  What do we do?
  Speaker 3
  And I think going back to your line of questions in the past about the people is, of all the things that I could point to that demonstrates what Starbucks is, has been and needs to be. It's the humanity and the people of the company. The company was built on being a performance-driven company through the lens of humanity. That's how it was built. And whenever we've lost our way, we've lost our way because people in power didn't understand that equation.
  Speaker 2
  And so I just said, I need to be in front of every store manager. I need a meeting with 10,000 people, the big conference room.
  Speaker 3
  And so in 2008, no American company was traveling.
  Speaker 6
  And so the municipalities were hungry for Starbucks to potentially have a meeting at a discount.
  Speaker 2
  And so we had Detroit come in, we had Houston come in, and then New Orleans came in.
  Speaker 3
  What they presented to us was the need for Starbucks to come as a result of Katrina. And when we heard that, we realized we've got to go to New Orleans.
  Speaker 2
  And in fact, what we're gonna do in New Orleans is we're gonna have one full day of 50,000 hours of community service in the Ninth Ward. Next day, we walked through and we built basically a tutorial on how to restore the business and how people walk through it. And we had classes and we had all these things going on. And the third day was my speech in the basketball Coliseum to 10,000 people.
  Speaker 3
  I'm at an hour before I was really feeling the burden of how important what I was gonna say is. And the CFO at the time, who subsequently resigned a week later, wasn't my guy. ([Time 1:46:02](https://share.snipd.com/snip/04039f9f-4ac6-43f0-a1c1-42d86a5c769c))
    - **Note:** Clear mission and vision of putting people first. Growth covers up mistakes success breeds hubris they lost their way. The turn around was framed at the store level. Each store needs 11 more customers a day not at the macro level. Coffee amazing high gross margin business. Brand invented a new wave and rode it. Had a great and intentional culture. Premium product and brand halo but catered to luxury and blue collar. The founder has the soul when he left they lost that soul a bit he had to bring it back. Scale and ubiniquity create complex but demand efficiency. Last that thing Howard wants is to become a commoditized utility and lose the brand halo. Touch points must be cultivated but hurt with scale mobile order ect. They slowly diluted the brand halo every interaction is either adding or taking away from the brand and overtime it’s a weighing machine. Qualitative aspect tough to define but vital. Asia cultivated the brand and performs better. Mobile app worst thing to happen to the brand. Wants to sacrifice money for brand equity and thinks current management has it wrong.
- The importance of maintaining a non-franchise model for Starbucks and the universal appeal of the company's values across different cultures
  Summary:
  Starbucks resisted becoming a franchise to avoid commoditization and maintain the personal aspect of coffee.
  The success of Starbucks globally is attributed to the universal desires of young people for opportunity, respect, dignity, and pride in their work. Despite cultural, language, and political differences, Starbucks has been able to transfer its values and culture to various countries.
  This success demonstrates the universal nature of humanity and the commonalities among people worldwide.
  The founder highlights the similarities between China and the US, emphasizing the need to focus on commonalities rather than differences as a global theme.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  And so even though there was pressure early on because of the cost of capital and we didn't have a lot of money to franchise, we'd have no CapEx.
  Speaker 6
  I said no, we resisted that. And I don't think we'd be having this conversation if Starbucks was a franchise system because McDonald's extraordinary company, but they're a commodity based product.
  Speaker 5
  Well, as you've been saying, from the beginning it was about elevating McDonald's great company.
  Speaker 3
  Nobody would ever accuse them of elevating the adult thing. Yeah. And that's why I don't want Starbucks to become transactional.
  Speaker 2
  Coffee is personal. The biggest magic and the lightning in the bottle is when you go to Japan or Shanghai or Malaysia and you see the culture in a way that you just can't believe, like how did it happen that
  Speaker 6
  We were able to transfer this to another country, different language, different culture, different politics. How do we do it?
  Speaker 1
  That's actually quite befuddling to me. Yeah. Because so many food and beverage concepts do not transfer geographies.
  Speaker 6
  I think it transferred because young people around the world, we all want the same thing. They want opportunity.
  Speaker 2
  They want to be respected.
  Speaker 6
  They want dignity.
  Speaker 2
  They want to make their parents proud.
  Speaker 6
  They want to work for a company that they believe in. And when I see what we've done around the world, I moved emotionally because the humanity I speak of is universal. That's why when I came back from China, what I said was I just want to say something about China and the US.
  Speaker 2
  I know all the rhetoric and the propaganda about our two countries.
  Speaker 6
  But what I see is that we have so much more in common than we have differences. And that should be the theme of the world right now. ([Time 2:13:21](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f7e5d9d1-a670-43fe-9f5f-3ffbe4759f9d))
    - **Note:** Keep brand halo people want to feel special and important
- Humanity as the Key to Starbucks' Success
  Summary:
  Starbucks' success is attributed to its emphasis on humanity and people, as evidenced by the company's initiatives such as providing health insurance to partners' family members and supporting employees in times of need.
  Despite imperfections, Starbucks' focus on humanity has set it apart from other companies, creating a culture that shines brightly but also raises the expectation for high standards. This emphasis on people has been a central theme in the company's success, with numerous stories reflecting the deep-rooted commitment to benefiting employees and communities.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 3
  And all the government meetings to tell the Starbucks story, and then we did things in China disruptively. Well, Belinda decided that she could go to the government and go to an insurance company and come back to Starbucks and get government approval for Starbucks to do the first, do something
  Speaker 6
  That had never been done before and provide health insurance to the parents and grandparents of our partners. Cool. So my Chinese government was so intrigued sitting down with them saying, can you get a new idea?
  Speaker 2
  Can you explain why do you want to do this? Right.
  Speaker 7
  You don't have to. Yeah.
  Speaker 2
  Right. Yeah. Because it's the culture of our company, we want to do everything we can to benefit our people.
  Speaker 3
  Humanity.
  Speaker 6
  And it's universal. But it's so, I think, important to just create some guardrails.
  Speaker 3
  So one day in the early stages of Starbucks, how would beer comes to my office one day? We're small at this stage. And he says, we got a terrible situation.
  Speaker 2
  I said, the manager of the Seattle Trust Store on second-in-manisence channel, Tom Carrey has AIDS.
  Speaker 6
  Now, AIDS at that time was like leprosy. Leprosy.
  Speaker 2
  So he, Tom comes in and he says, I need to resign from Starbucks.
  Speaker 3
  And he's crying.
  Speaker 6
  Do you have any health insurance? No. And so we covered Tom Carrey from that point on. And it was those kinds of imprinting moments. And there were many like that. Right.
  Speaker 1
  I think it's funny. So I have heard that story probably five times. Because I've consumed an incredible amount of Starbucks content over the last couple of months. And I've heard a story about Starbucks employees wanting to buy a cow for a farm or an Africa and stories about Flint, Michigan and stories about the initiative to bring the company together To try to bring the country together when the government was shut down in 2013, whenever that was. And I was getting frustrated watching all these stories because I kept thinking, this is not the answer to why Starbucks worked. These are these one-off anecdotes that are sure they're emblematic of some broader theme. But at the end of the day, the answer to why Starbucks works has to be something about the business model. And every time you walk into the store, X, Y, Z happens. And here's the economics. But it turns out there are thousands of these stories. And it's the humanity seeping through. And it's hard for the company to tell the story because everyone just feels like a random one-off example. But they're happening in every community and every part of the country. And I think that is the, for me, as a business historian, that's been the thing that's been happening, that jumps out is there's no other company that we've studied that has this sort Of obsession with people and humanity the way that Starbucks does.
  Speaker 2
  And we're not perfect.
  Speaker 3
  And so we do make mistakes.
  Speaker 2
  And when the brand is being shined so brightly, it's a high standard to be held to you. We live in an environment where if you do make a mistake and we are human, we're going to make mistakes, unfortunately, that becomes the thing. Yep.
  Speaker 4
  And it's tough to fight that.
  Speaker 1
  Before you open, I'd love to kind of flash forward. You were CEO through 2017. Kevin Johnson took over 2017 to 2022. You came back for one year as interim CEO. And now, Alaxman is the CEO and has been in the seat for about a year. You came in after a tumultuous COVID era and tried to basically figure out who the successor was going to be and patch the ship in the meantime. ([Time 2:17:49](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e2cade24-bb6f-4c03-bc53-b9dd40fdd301))
    - **Note:** Obsession with people and humanity. Build on compassion empathy and love. Laser focused on employees and caring deeply about his people and customers is what comes through.
- The Trap of Founder Dependency
  Summary:
  Founder-led companies often rely on the entrepreneurial vision and maverick acts of their founder to succeed.
  However, this reliance can cover up mistakes and hinder the company's growth in the long term. When founders leave, the company may struggle to maintain its innovative edge and may start playing defense instead of staying on the offense.
  This defensive mindset, driven by the fear of failure, can be detrimental to the company's success.
  Companies must transition from founder dependency to a sustainable structure that promotes innovation and proactive strategies to avoid stagnation.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 3
  Not that I didn't want succession. It wasn't really on my mind. The marketing and the merchant mentality of Starbucks was always with me and probably did not allow others who were well intended and could have done good things were following and
  Speaker 2
  Leaning on me, which is not the healthiest thing over the longevity of the company.
  Speaker 3
  I think that has covered up mistakes, that's covered up things and then was revealed when I left.
  Speaker 1
  I mean, it's the very things that make the business successful, the founder bets, that then at some point in the company's second act, hold it back. You have all this muscle memory as a company of relying on founder Maverick acts. Yeah. At some point, you need to figure out how as a company to not.
  Speaker 6
  The other thing about that is most founder led companies are entrepreneur driven.
  Speaker 3
  It's not that they're not following the rules.
  Speaker 2
  They're making the rules, especially if you're creating an industry that did not exist. Their leaves, I'm not talking about me historically, and companies lose not only the extent of the entrepreneurial DNA, but they lose the ability to be on offense.
  Speaker 3
  The worst thing that a company can do like a sports team is start playing defense because you're afraid to fail.
  Speaker 6
  That is a disease.
  Speaker 3
  And unlike another disease, which has happened in Starbucks, which is Ubers, the worst thing that could happen to a company is believing that you are incapable of doing anything but Succeeding and you deserve the success.
  Speaker 2
  But if you start playing defense and don't have the offensive mind, it's not going to go well.
  Speaker 6
  And I think over time that has happened at Starbucks. ([Time 2:58:35](https://share.snipd.com/snip/cc5f494b-bd59-4f1e-b51a-7c9d162e634d))
    - **Note:** Founder led companies must make the rules and be constantly on the attack without hubris. Be constantly on offense. Can’t be afraid of failure. Starbucks isn’t in the transaction but experience business people are longing for human connection wants to provide through Starbucks not just transactions.
