  Speaker 2
  So that was the, the the situation i found myself in. I had this book recommended to me, but i didn't know anything about texedo park. I didn't know anything. I didn't know who alfred lee lomas was before i started reading. And i think that title the most interesting man i knew nothing about. Am, it's a good way to think about him.
  Speaker 1
  O ks, i want to tart with this personality. And there's, there's embedded in this book is o the author's relativesi was a young scientist working and doing experiments at toxedo park, and he winds up killing himself when he was 39 years old. But before he killed himself, he wrote a fictional account of some of the experiments that were done at this hidden laboratory.
  Speaker 2
  And thisias laboratorys about forty miles outside of manhattan.
  Speaker 1
  And the book he wrote was called brain wave and death.
  Speaker 2
  The reason it's called that is because one of the early experiments at sexedo park park had to do with measuring brain waves. The idea, you know, how you have these different cycles of sleep. A lot of our understanding of those different cycles of sleep came out of some of the early experiments that were done under the direction of alfred lee lomas at suceto park.

    - **Note:** He was a kinda Batman like figure who was the last great civil scientists. He was a rich Wall Street tycoon that moonlighted as a physicist who was designing weapons to preempt the fear he had for Germany and ww2. He was intensely private and funded science that Einstein did. He worked with vanever bush to jump start America science which was needed to catch up with Germany. Worked at the rad lab and built the radar ran that project.
- And in that there's a lot of talk
  Key takeaways:
  - The book being referenced is helpful to understand another book.
  - In 1938, it was illegal for Jews in Germany to hold positions in university and government.
  - Expelled Jewish scientists came to Tuxedo Park as a safe refuge.
  - Alfred Lee Lomis had direct relationships with these scientists and knew about their capabilities.
  - Germany had a technical and scientific advantage over the United States and Britain.
  - Tuxedo Park flourished from 1926 to 1940.
  - The tower house was hastily closed in 1940.

  Speaker 2
  And in that there's a lot of talk, i obact, reading that book is actually helpful to understand this book. In that's a lot of talk about all that, you knowbut i think in 19 38, it was illegal for for jews in germany to hold any kind of a position in university, government lso as einstein being One of the most famous, you know, they were expelled all throughout the world. And and some came to united states, some to other places in europe to try to find, like, a safe refuge. And a lot of these expelled jewish scientists came to tuxedo park. And so that would answer the question that you might be asking yourself, well, how does alfred lee lomis know what is going to happen before even the the government on the united states? And it's because he had direct relationships with a lot of these former german scientists that came over said, hay, this is what we are capable of doing.
  Speaker 1
  Germany right now has the technical and scientific advantage over the united states and britain. And i'm going to run over my point here, but i want to read this to you anyway. So says, fromist grand beginnings in 19 26, this talk about the texeto park and to the day, was hastily shuttered 19 forty, during a during the decade and a half, the tower house flourished.

    - **Note:** Your life doesn’t need to fit in the box it can be much broader if you’d like. He had a nice job and family but it just wasn’t him. He wasn’t built to exist in the box so he broke out. The world is malleable you can change and influence the world and build your own world don’t passively accept the situation you’re given. He created his own world he didn’t enjoy going out and having fun as a New York socialite. He just sat in his castle and did science this was his thick desire and positioned him to create all he did during the wartime years. Can’t connect the dots looking back. Detached from society insulated science from business secret life. Did what he wanted.
- The dedication and audacious investigations of Alfred
  Key takeaways:
  - The people studied in biographies demonstrate commitment and dedication to their goals.
  - Experiences and excitement result from dedicating oneself to a broader life goal.
  - Forman Lumis exiled himself from New York society to focus on science.
  - Lumis financed audacious investigations in various fields.
  - Lumis' wealth allowed him to acquire skills and overcome Germany's scientific advantage.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  It's true for, i can't think of an example of any of the people we've studied, any of the biographies read that that's not true. Forman u w're going to see alfred realizing, hay. I mean, think about te the amount. I don't wat to cal it arrogance, beause that's a lack that's not a good description of it. But single individuals like i'm going to dedicate myself to overcoming germany's scientific advantage, you can't get much more of a broader life.
  Speaker 2
  And then all the excitement and, ah, the experiences that he has in just a few short a years, it as a direct result of that commitment to that goal.
  Speaker 1
  So let me get into that. There's a lot to read herelumis exiled himself from the glittering world of new york society because he wanted to devote all his time to science. He set himself up in a castle on a high hill in tuxedo park and financed his own audacious, audacious investigations of the stars, the heart, the brain and the secrets of the world. This is before he makes that commitment. He's just interested in science a. He wants to learn physics a. But he's going to all the experiences he has for the years that he i am going to pursue. And when yo used my wealth to pursue a the experiments that am interested and eventually allow him to acquire skills that he can use in that dedication of overcoming germany' scientific
  Speaker 2
  Advantage. ([Time 0:21:33](https://share.snipd.com/snip/42153fda-1169-4d6e-a838-285ab0d402ee))
    - **Note:** He’s a patent lawyer but always building on the side constant coming up with new ideas. He became chief of the experimental department in WW1 because of the work he did. He did this at 29 and then 20 years later did the same thing in ww2. After WW1 he wanted to make money risks lawyer security to speculate on Wall Street he was smart and made a lot of money. Wanted to buy his independence worked with his brother in law. They were investment bankers. They made their wealth on the insight the rural electrification would grow and they set themselves up to finance that growth. He’s using finance to make money and studying science his ultimate goal on the side because that’s what he wanted to do. He became the best name in electric utilities and had an amazing run.
- Lomis and Thorn's Nine Year Run Reviving Bonbright
  Key takeaways:
  - Utility holding companies were created by bundling the management and facilities of smaller operators into larger, integrated systems
  - These holding companies allowed operating companies to obtain funds by issuing securities, enabling them to expand their operations
  - Investors could diversify their investments by investing in a group of utility holding companies instead of one
  - Lomis and Thorn's successful revival of Bonbright from near bankruptcy to a leading private investment house specializing in utilities became a Wall Street legend
  - Lomis had two demanding jobs during this period - vice president of Bonbright and a scientist
  - Lomis devoted nights, weekends, and vacations to his scientific research experiments at Tower House
  - Lomis was recommended to read journals and books by physicist R.W. Woods as part of his ongoing work

  They helped create utility holding companies. Is what i mean about being similar to j p morgan strategy.
  Speaker 1
  They helpd create utility holding companies by bundling the management and facilities of smaller operators into larger, integrated systems. They called them super powers. This allowed the operating companies to obtain funds by issuing securities. That' how they'r raising money, and thereby enlargetheir operations, very straightforward. The holding companies were also a better medium for investors, who, instead of taking common shares in one holding company, were able to invest ana diversified group. Lomis and thorn's phenomenal nine year run reviving bonbright, which is the firm they took over from near bankruptcy to its vaunted status as the leading private investment house
  Speaker 2
  Specializing utilities, became a wall street legend. This is the time in lemis's life that he has essentially too full time demanding jobs.
  Speaker 1
  As we sas lumis continued in his capacity as vice president of bonbright five days a week, devoting nights, in week ends and vacations to an expanding array of research experiments Under way at tower house. He was now thoroughly committed to his second career as a scientist, and piled extra work on himself, spending every spare hour reading the journals and books. Woods, this is r w woods, who's also a famous physicist, recommended as part of his ongoing education. ([Time 0:30:04](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7d92d0c6-0d42-4596-9052-f6402f3a3690))
    - **Note:** Loomis knew crashes were inevitable and kept his profits in cash and t bills when the market turned he had a war chest and that’s how he made his second Fourtune. Made his money then quit. He easily laid down his legal and finance job and moved on he made up his mind couldn’t be convinced. Loomis was hiring all these scientists knew what tech hitler had and started building to be prepared this was the same preparedness that thomas Edison advocated for during WW1. Figuring the best from others. Thought of Loomis as a 20th century Ben Franklin. Very troubled about nukes in Germany so built to change that shaped the world. Preparedness without provocation believed in the American ingenuity and ability to solve great problems. Loomis did what Edison did. Focused on what the most actionable wartime tech was.

  Injured or anything. But for a few days they couldn't contact him. So he's worried that his brother was killed in this attack. And Germany does a lot of dumb things during the war. But not that they did it on purpose, but the idea that you attack the brother of one of the greatest scientific minds that America has, and now this guy's going to go against you, very unwise Decision there. So it's at this point they have everybody, they have the resources, they shut down to Exitopark and they start the rad lab. So it says, for the next four years he would mean Loomis would drive himself and his band of physicists almost without break to develop the all-important radar warning systems based On the magnetron. That's the device that Churchill sent over to America. Looking back on the tenths autumn in 1940, Bo and Bose did, that's another person, it was a gift from the gods that we disclosed to Alfred Loomis and Carl Compton, meaning the magnetron. You know, I'm definitely pronouncing that incorrectly by the way. This guy Carl Compton, Compton is a physicist and the president of MIT, so he's got to work closely with Alfred Loomis. If you understood better than Bush, the critical role this unprecedented partnership would play in determining the course of the war.

    - **Note:** Loomis was a man of action and focused on building what was practical. He moved to be singularly focused on the single most pressing problem and work on a solution. Loomis was able to galvanize apolitical physicists into action. He worked with a famous physicist from the time who had the social cred to recruit the best. Loomis knew they wouldn’t listen to him so he found the guy the genius would listen to because he know how important physics would be in the war. Started behind them then greatly outpaced them and did this through cooperation.
- The German General Loomist Overcame Germany's Scientific Advantage
  Summary:
  In a thrilling match, Team A emerged victorious over Team B with a last-minute goal.
  The spectators were on the edge of their seats as both teams displayed incredible skills and strategies. Team A's captain, John Doe, became the hero of the match with his stunning goal in the final seconds.
  The atmosphere was electric as the crowd erupted in cheers, celebrating their team's hard-fought win.

  Was forced to admit that the methods of radio locations that the Allies have introduced have conquered the U-boat menace. As he later wrote, radar threatened to provide the Allies with the keys to victory unless Germany could address the disparity in their technological prowess. Now, let me read that to you again. Unless Germany could address the disparity in their technological prowess, compare that, juxtapose that with Loomist's personal goal. I will dedicate myself to overcoming Germany's scientific advantage, and he fucking did it. Just listen to this description from Karl, this German general, and tell me how you could not be fired up by the dedication of all these scientists and physicists led by Loomist. This is amazing. For some months past, the enemy has rendered the U-boat ineffective. He has achieved the objective not to superior tactics or strategy, but through his superiority in the field of science. This finds his expression in the modern battle weapon, detection, what they call radar. By this means he has torn our sole offensive weapon in the war against the Anglo-Saxons from our hands. They use that technology not only to take off the German U-boats, they're able to start shooting out, they build this ([Time 0:46:47](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8492a99e-2b66-4922-afca-5dc784e0e185))

      German arrogance was their undoing. He understood the wartime mentality and going all in with no plan b is a key to success but tough to replicate. He would commit to a path and focus on the most important thing. Burn the boats extreme focus. Got things done in bureaucracy always looking forward never back.
