### Highlights

- Depended on his devotion of his admirals. He trusted them and he came from the people of all else. He could think quicker and more originally.
  The other people didn’t see the game through the eyes of the people they saw kings abs queens napoleon was playing a different game they couldn’t understand.
  Ruled as a conquering hero and
  Mobilizing resources and support to destroy entrenched hierarchies. Took advantage of the wars to develop his system which was similar to the old autocratic system in the end but saw his opportunity.
  Why do we need another biography but this author wanted to cut out the fluff and get to the essence of the man. 200 pages vs 1600.

    - **Note:** Napoleon relied on the devotion and trust of people around him but he was an incredibly smart and original person. He saw the game of kings and queens people had played forever in a new way through the world of autocrats and built his own world. He destroyed the system and learned from history took his opportunity right place and time to start of revolution and it worked.
- Napoleon was a man who deeply understood his image. He became emperor of France in his 30s and ran europe in his 40s but was exhaled at 45. In his conquest back in a battle he walked up to the front lines opened his jacket and said he was the emperor and to join him. The men were ordered to shoot but didn’t and in this they went from an under resourced army against a bigger opposition to one that doubled in size without a shot fired. Cult of personality. Bold brilliant and shrewd. Talked externally to the citizens but within his organization. Shared base of knowledge within your team. Shared vision and mission.
  Went to a military boarding school as a kid where he was bullied for being an out group. This helped him develop his resolve and metal.

    - **Note:** He had a strong cult of personality and was a great leader of men. He had a shared mission and vision with his team but eventually he got too proud and that’s what did him in. Incredible conquered as a result of being a great motivator of men.
- He read and learned a ton. Big private lottery.
  Has an intensity and drive that drove him to success chaos is a ladder and that French revolutionary chaos allowed Napoleon to climb.
  He was politically and otherwise ruthless.
  Could easily see opponents weak points and was willing to lead the line into battle. Skill energy ruthlessness and sheer luck. Only after being named commander of the 3rd largest army in France does he believe he can realize his dream of rule and conquest. He was 26. The world is malleable. Went from French general to leader in 3 years using social monbolity from the revolution timing is vital.
  He used human nature and reward his men with medals and honors for valor. General Patton used similar tactics to inspire mean towards greatness for themselves and the wider country. Think of telling your grandchildren. Bezos also used this saying it’s not easy but nothing worth doing is. Appealed to pride and destiny.

    - **Note:** Constant learner and benefited from chaos to rise from general to leader in 3 years. Praised his men and lifted them up so they followed him into battle. Create easy ways to praise. Nothing worth doing is easy. Human nature never changes.
- Wanted to be approachable by his soldiers. Founded 2 newspapers to report on his conquests. Flair for storytelling. His issue is he gets his cart ahead of his horse. He thought he was a god and this lead to his downfall. Don’t get high on your own supply. This turned him into a monarch and this lead to his downfall. He became what he wanted to replace. Became not a king but emperor.
  Student of history understood rise of ceaser Charlemagne and modeled his rule after this.
  Compete where you have an edge and when you don’t have this edge don’t fight. Napoleon thought he could beat the Brittish in the seas. Brittan thought they could be the Indians with European tactics. Play only where you have an edge.
  Napoleon showed weakness to conceal a strength. Wanted people to attack him so he could ruthlessly execute his plan.

    - **Note:** Play your game and don’t let it get out of hand. Napoleon became too prideful and turn into what he was running from and this was his downfall. Concealed strength. Studied history learned from the past but absolute power corrupts absolutely
- Most people put artificial limits on your life. There are no limits just platues. Don’t put artificial limits on yourself.
  Napoleons fall lead because he didn’t invest in his health and relationships build for the long term.
  Additionally he had little foundation. You need to grow off a solid base if this is flimsy you will collapse. Power of a good stable base.
  Don’t get high on your own supply.
  Don’t give your competition time to prepare. Move in silence.
  Don’t let the opponents dictate your game when Napoleon invaded Russia the Russians made him play their game and he lost.
  Napoleons army was getting bloated and he was getting old and slow and was focused on the home front as well. The distracted don’t beat the focused.
  They were unprepared for the Russian winter and the defeat was the nail in Napoleons coffin to be hurried at Waterloo.
