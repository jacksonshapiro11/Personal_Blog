- The 5 ws tell someone who what where when and why. Giving the why is most important. Importance of being elite within a niche but also having scale in business. Scale is vital but it bumps against bureaucracy. We like social proof which feeds into an advantage of scale. When you compound your advantage especially at scale is vital. Scale is compounding but scale creates disadvantages of scale as well like narrowcasting. Scale is beuracrac. Benefits of ccompeting well in your niche like Sam Walton creating competition against other small participants. Surfing the wave of technology and only play games where you have an edge. Unique differentiation. The wise make focused concentrated bets. You need to stay in the game long enough to get lucky. Auto catalytic sets when the current tools create a self reinforcing reaction to further an advantage when advantages within the company play off each other feed each other.

  Speaker 1
  And Charlie's got to know some of his father's clients and got to, you know, be essentially be, is have these conversations with his father, learn a law from his father. And so this is something he learned. And again, meta lesson is how to teach a lesson and why you want to go for great. Here's another model for my father's law practice. When I was very young, one of his best friends was this guy named Grant McFadden. He owned a bunch of four dealerships. He was a perfectly marvelous man. He was self made and he made his own way in the world. He was a brilliant man of enormous charm and integrity, just a wonderful, wonderful man. In contrast, my father had another client who was a blowhard, an overreaching, unfair, pompous, difficult man. And I must have been 14 years old. When I asked my dad, why do you do so much work for Mr. X, this overreaching blowhard, instead of working more for a wonderful man like your friend, Grant McFadden. My father said, Graham McFadden treats his employees right, his customers right, and his problems right. And if he gets involved with a psychotic, he quickly walks away and works out an exit as fast as he can. Therefore, Graham McFadden doesn't have enough law business to keep you going. Wisdom is prevention. He prevents the problems. The lawyers are hired to fix the problems. But Mr. X is a walking minefield of wonderful legal business. This case demonstrates one of the troubles with practicing law. This is now Charlie speaking. To a considerable extent, you're going to be dealing with grossly defective people. They create an enormous amount of law business. ([Time 1:06:20](https://share.snipd.com/snip/dbc00b23-f0cc-464b-b425-4f19d709f471))
    - **Note:** Deal with only high quality people and live above board. Don’t teach directly teach through indirect examples and allow people to use some slight mental reach that allows the student to own the ideas themselves. Big benefit of learning from others. Multidisciplinary learning from big models from all disciplines. Acquisition of wisdom and passing it on is a moral duty. The best way to get what you want is to deserve what you want. Go to bed slightly smaller than you woke up. Play to your strengths not your weaknesses. Follow your natural interests and work with people you admire. Trust is vital in all organizations know the bad news first the good news takes care of itself. Seeing from the front ask the people on the ground. Avoid Persian messenger syndrome aka shooting the messenger because then you get bad info or no info. Her incentives right.

  Speaker 1
  This pops up again and again he talks about the history of Xerox one of the Xerox founders is a scam named Joe Wilson. He had a similar experience he couldn't understand why its new machine was selling so poorly in relation to its older and inferior machine. So then he goes and looks and he finds out that the commission arrangement with the salespeople at Xerox gave a large and perverse incentive to push the inferior machine on customers. So of course you're the salesperson and say hey I get a hundred dollars if I sell the old machine or I get fifty dollars if I sell the new machine you're just gonna what you're doing is logical. It's the the person at fault is the person that's designing the incentive structure and so this is Charlie's solution never ever think about something else when you should be thinking About the power of incentives. One thing you'll notice if you listen to Charlie talk or if you read a bunch of books about him uh Buffett does this in the shareholders letters as well actually let me read this from uh Buffett shareholder letter. Buffett says the behavior of peer companies whether they're expanding acquiring setting executive competition composition whatever will be mindlessly imitated. So he's saying the behavior of peer companies will be mindlessly imitated and what they're both shocked at Buffett also says that it always amazes him how high IQ people mindlessly Imitate. So he talked about the benefit of social proof especially usually it's social proof uh being ([Time 1:25:28](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4623f20a-0102-46f6-84f6-db88c9894009))
