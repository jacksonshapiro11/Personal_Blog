He suggests testing arguments by considering opposing viewpoints and being cautious of opinions that simply flatter one's self-esteem. Russell highlights the value of self-awareness, cross-cultural exposure, and engaging in imaginary dialogues to challenge one's beliefs and reduce dogmatism. By encouraging critical thinking and humility, Russell advocates for a more rational and open-minded approach to forming opinions and making decisions.

### Highlights

- **If an opinion contrary to your own makes you angry, that is a sign that you are subconsciously aware of having no good reason for thinking as you do.** If some one maintains that two and two are five, or that Iceland is on the equator, you feel pity rather than anger, unless you know so little of arithmetic or geography that his opinion shakes your own contrary conviction. The most savage controversies are those about matters as to which there is no good evidence either way. Persecution is used in theology, not in arithmetic, because in arithmetic there is knowledge, but in theology there is only opinion.
