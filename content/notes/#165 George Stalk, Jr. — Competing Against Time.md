### Highlights

- Knowing Your Costs and Being Fast: Key Business Strategies
  Key takeaways:
  - Knowing your costs better than your competitors can give you a competitive advantage
  - Average costs may hide important differences in costs and profitability of different customers and products
  - Being faster than competitors at delivering what customers want is important for success

  Well, the one that always works is know your costs better than your competitors and other costs Because most people Don't know their costs. They think they do They know the cost that gets between the revenues and the profit line And those are all averages and they don't go behind the averages And if you go behind the averages what what people will discover Is that some things cost more than they thought they did and some things cost less And some customers are more profitable and some are less profitable And if you know your costs better than your competitor though their costs you could do nasty things gain market share Because You would understand how the costs work your costs work and not what the volumes mean So what may appear to be a Less profitable Customers actually the high-volume customer produces a whole bunch of economies of scale And it reduces costs, but that that'll gets lost in the averages. So that's that's a big winner One that works very well is be faster than your competitors at providing your customers what they want When they want it and where they want it And if a company can do that two or three times faster than its competitors It'll usually grow Two to three times faster. It'll be twice as profitable And that was the story of Walmart versus Kmart for many years. That's the story of Toronto versus most of the rest of the auto industry It's a BMW Mercedes Hardball M&A was another one buying companies to to round out a competitive position Or extend one after one client Uh, it was in the medical devices Business of second best competitor Was beginning to grow and so they just bought them out Now there are people in Washington and in Canada that are paid to stop that kind of stuff from happening ([Time 0:05:30](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2bf0cc58-f0c5-4e2e-956a-57090ca12ecd))
    - **Note:** Know and control your costs.
- Differences between managing public and family companies
  Key takeaways:
  - Family companies that bring in professional management fall into two categories: involved and non-involved owner groups
  - An involved owner group may bring in non-professional managers but still closely watches the business, while a non-involved owner group may turn the whole business over to someone else
  - Family companies expect to last more than one generation and may have time horizons of 40 years or more
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Can you tell me more about that specifically as they relate to um, say public companies with Professional management versus family companies perhaps with or without Professional management I should clarify something family companies that bring in professional management fall into two groups Uh, one is an involved owner group and one is a non-involved owner group And the involved owner group. I may bring in non professional managers But i'm watching them closely because I still own the business. I still want to see the business do well And a non-involved ownership group. I might just be very happy to let turn this whole thing over that To person a and let them run run the business Uh, and I have to find a way to reward them To to keep them from being hired away by a public company But it's still well um In terms of time horizons I think The the family involved Is this expects to sing the last more than one generation? Expects the next generation? To take on the visit that thought when you say that would one says the next generation one's talking about 40 years Because managed generations are about 20 years.

    - **Note:** Family businesses are less exposed to upside and downside so through cycles perform better but not as well in the up cycle. Building for long term vs quarterly incentives.
- Examples of Anomalies in Service Scheduling and Sales Strategy in Different Businesses
  Key takeaways:
  - An office products company requested service to be done between midnight and 6 a.m. despite it not being the norm.
  - The client wanted overnight service to avoid production interruption and had a higher share of the business.
  - A medical device business had a competitor who always had a service representative on site at hospitals but our client did not.
  - The competitor had a higher share of new business due to higher equipment uptime provided by on site service.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Another anomaly was one what it was a office products company Um That had its own service force and one customer insisted on all service being done between midnight and six a.m That's an anomaly Because that's not the way we schedule service, but for this company The local people did that And it turns out that company that wanted overnight service Wanted because they didn't want their production interrupted or the use of equipment interrupted Um And in those situations this client had a higher share of the business In a medical device business, a rambling was Uh, the european competitor always had a sales a scoop. He always had a service representative on site at the hospital It's a bit of devices That looked like a high cost thing to do. We didn't do that our client had a service force. It was moved around hospitals as needed But it turned out the uptime for the equipment that this on site Uh Service person was taken care of was higher And it turns out that the the share of new business Uh that this competitor got was higher So we have an anomaly here, you know, he's doing something doesn't make sense But if what starts looking at numbers it does start to make sense So anomalies are a great way to find a new way to do business a great way to find growth Because usually they're small And the question at wasos could we make it big?
  Speaker 2
  Stuff to answer that question You mentioned earlier that walmart sort of attacked came out with velocity. Can you tell us that story?
  Speaker 1
  Walmart story as it was described Uh early in the years of walmart was about uh a local Five and dime competitor Uh Grows and boondock markets has greeters at the door to make people comfortable and help by their way around ([Time 0:49:28](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b869b9b7-4732-474f-a589-f36bfc369d1c))
    - **Note:** Look for and exploit anomalies. If something is being done different and gets results find out why.
- The Importance of Time Management in Competitive Strategy
  Key takeaways:
  - The Japanese factory in the example was 3 times as complex, half the size, and twice as productive as the Ford factory
  - The time to produce a product at the Japanese factory was 10 times faster than at the Ford factory
  - BCG's previous strategies were based on cost, but the time advantage sparked a focus on strategy, including speed and competition
  - Time is an important dimension in management that is often overlooked
  - One early application of the time advantage was next day delivery in competition with delivery every two weeks
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Well, if you come back to the Japanese and Ford example, you know Japanese factory that was Three times as complex Half the size and twice as pro productive The I didn't mention the time to mention the product went to that factory 10 times faster than through the Ford factory 10 times faster you know the 20% productivity advantage was about About a 20% cost advantage. This is a big number for a automotive component But the time advantage was 10 times. That's what triggered our thinking about strategy Because up until then BCG was Predominant strategies were based on cost. How do I have lower cost in your how do I help you have lower cost in your competitors? And that as I mentioned drove us to scale and focus Uh, but here's time Here's another here's the next another dimension people aren't managing And what could you do with 10 times the speed that was the question we started asking. How could you compete with that? Well, I was one of the early applications of that which I could compete Uh with next day delivery versus delivery every two weeks And if I could have next day delivery to the merchants That allowed the merchants to order more frequently and operate with less capital. That's how that's where the advantage kicked in And so that's where cost and time worked out. We had we added costs to the process to get time out the other side ([Time 1:01:00](https://share.snipd.com/snip/08a9a8a2-8fb2-4040-9c89-ca1110fbe448))
    - **Note:** Do things faster than competition and cheaper. Tighter feedback loops and manage complexity.
- The Origins and Effects of Lean Manufacturing and Just-in-Time Systems
  Key takeaways:
  - Lean manufacturing and just-in-time are similar concepts that refer to small batch, minimum material, self-scheduling manufacturing processes.
  - Toyota pioneered the just-in-time system in the 50s as a solution to compete with Nissan who was Japan's largest car company at the time.
  - The just-in-time system was created to allow for low scale and complexity while still being competitive.
  - The effects of lean manufacturing and just-in-time on an organization show up on the balance sheet in the form of higher asset productivity and higher productivity of plant equipment.
  - Supply chains are seen as a source of improvement in implementing lean manufacturing and just-in-time processes.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Let me break that in a couple parts lean manufacturing and just in time Are it from my experience or describing the same phenomena? The small batch minimum material has like self-scheduling manufacturing process that Toyota pioneered in the 50s and interestingly enough It was a solution to I had to come up with to compete with Nissan Because in the 50s Nissan was Japan's largest car company And Toyota was just getting in the cars So the Toyota didn't have scale it didn't have the breath of product line offered so I had to figure out how to compete at low scale and With more complexity that it might want to use so it created the just-in-time system Ford had the just-in-time system as well, but it was it was high volume focused model T's type of stuff So let's do a very similar the effects of them being together the effects of the money organization do show up on the balance if they show up on higher asset productivity In the form Of higher work again with productivity and higher productivity of plant equipment. So those are together I've been looking at supply chains as a source of strategic advantage for about 15 years now and I just finished a paper for the Harvard Business Review uh That was originally titled how to use the supply chain crisis that gets competitors And I'm going I'm explaining this because I want you to understand my perspective I really don't care about supply chain crisis. What I care about is how do I use the crisis in a way That puts my competitors of disadvantage Because I can't as a company Or anybody I can't fix a supply chain crisis I have to fair ([Time 1:17:53](https://share.snipd.com/snip/cf23f042-7062-4ddf-897b-2b48709f72d8))
    - **Note:** How do you use the supply chain crisis to your advantage. Accept the state of the world and play the game in front of you a retailer can’t fix it so they must leverage it.
- Strategic Supply Chain Decisions and Optimizing System Performance
  Key takeaways:
  - Strategic use of supply chain is important but may not look like the right decision in the moment
  - Maintaining inventory can lead to more profits in the long run
  - Optimizing the entire system performance before figuring out individual optimization is crucial
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  There's so many ways to strategically use your supply chain Your access to raw materials all of this stuff But it always in the moment it usually never looks like the right decision because it's costing you more like if you're a manufacturing company And say you had a year of raw materials On hand before covet hit You can keep pumping through even though there's a supply chain that you're the only one in business You're gonna make more money in that 12 months and that inventory ever cost you Uh to hold and acquire but you don't want to do it because you have investors they have a different timeline It looks like bloat on the balance sheet looks like inefficiency.
  Speaker 1
  How do you sort of like Way those things against each other the difficulty to do it requires that people look at the entire system And and optimize the system performance first before they figure out what their portion of that Optimization is is they're gonna keep the crew Stanley black and decra was one of the companies that early on And covet lockdowns we've got put them together. ([Time 1:25:19](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b7e628f3-db39-4d2d-bc53-d6692c0527e6))
    - **Note:** Optimize system performance and build in robustness so you can pounce at opportunity
- The Importance of Low Variance in a High-Performing Supply Chain
  Key takeaways:
  - There are two sources of variance in supply chain: changes in the outside world and self-generation
  - A high variance supply chain is costlier than a low variance one
  - A fast and low variance supply chain performs better than a slow and high variance one
  - It is not necessary to fix the entire supply chain problem; just making one's own better can give a competitive advantage
  - Variance in the supply chain can be managed
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  The other Um, so there's a high variance advantage as possible Uh, just a foot note on that is that Variance that comes from two sources Uh, it comes from changes in the out out world outside world In the case of an airline it comes from a storm something like that That's a very poor closure Or it can be self-generated And it turns out the supply chain that has a high high Amount of time on high variance because they always go together Even even if the outside world doesn't change very much at all, it'll generate its own turbulence inside And the and turbulence equates the cost And so a supply chain that's fast and low variance is much higher performing supply chain that's That's slow and high variance And again, I don't have to fix this supply chain problem. I just have to make mine better than that Then my competitors that I can do nasty things to them Uh, I say it's gonna take a while to to fruition because most people don't think they can manage the variance in the supply chain The answer is you can manage the variance in the supply chain can any tires a perfect example They use something called flowcast take it can retire Which means on a daily basis they're looking at each element of their supply chain and trying to figure out how it's doing Where the variances are then where they have problems they throw people at it ([Time 1:28:28](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b4e576ad-cdc0-4513-b205-99de670256d3))
    - **Note:** Want to keep your supply chain fast and low variance. Speed and avoiding fragility and negative extranalities is key.
