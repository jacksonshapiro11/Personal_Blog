### Highlights

- The ideal mindset is fearless not reckless. Good trading is self trust and belief. Don’t be biased by the past just because 15 heads came in a row doesn’t mean it’s not a 50-50 situation. We need to separate our perception from our interpretations. What we focus on is what we attract. Our beliefs guide our experience the bias inherent in models. Create the right mindset by dominating the stories you tell yourself to craft your mind which leads to success. Your beliefs shape your world so you need your deeply understand your beliefs.

Embrace pain. Practice losing and winning big amounts of money. Don’t get too happy or sad remain balanced throughout that is the key. Run towers danger. Assumes he’s wrong until the market proves him right. expect to be wrong emotions kill trading
- Take possession of your life no one is coming to save you. Understand your weaknesses. We all know what to do we just get distracted between thought and action so we must constantly reinforce our purpose. Tell yourself where you want to go and what you want to do. Through meditating and aformation. Exposing yourself to the world is good for you bad for the ego. Exposing weakness is a good thing. Failure is a rocket fuel for growth. Be honest with yourself. He does mental exercises where he imagines the position mooning and going to zero. Figures out what he’ll do in those situations. Good news bad news does the mental prep ahead of time to ground himself. Behavior is patterns make and keep changes how we think feel and act makes us who we are. Expand your mind and horizon and mentally reinforce the good behavior. Make and keep changes. Be mindful of dreams and goals and be mindful of what will prevent you from success. Visualize success know how you’ll sabotage and avoid those things. When we remove all failure we guarantee success. Change behavior that doesn’t serve you. He visualizes fear and failure to prepare for it. If you’re having a bad day and can rerack and refocus do it. You should be out there if you’re not sick. Don’t play on tilt just because you’ve made 3 bad trades in a row doesn’t mean you should stop. Bet more when you’re winning.
- Change your mind is big and trading don’t bargain hunt even though it’s human nature it’s terrible trading. The financial markets aren’t supermarkets bargains aren’t real and you can’t hunt them. Take a loss and move on. Don’t postpone pain. We want instant gratification and to delay pain. You need a time in your day to ground yourself whether it’s journaling or meditation. Disgust is a stronger motivator. Hate motivates us more than love. Disgust is stronger than joy or happiness leverage it for your advantage. Break yourself down so you can redesign yourself how you want. Introspection is uncomfortable because you break yourself down and be yourself naked, but you must do that in order to recover and build yourself back up question everything to discover who you are. You clear the debris so new growth can start. You become disgusted with your lack of progress. Power in saying this is who I am and I hate it. Control your mind control your future. You must take responsibility for who you are. Be authentic and take ownership of your life. Don’t be subservient to yourself.
- Surrender and empty your mind. Let the market guide you. The market thinks something simple can’t be possible. Don’t focus on what should happen just what is happening. Fight your innate human bias. Don’t keep hope to avoid pain. Embrace your pain. Don’t do things to avoid pain like selling winners early or holding losers to break even. Act without fear. People trade less when they’re winning and more when they’re losing but it should be the other way around. Mitigate fear. Understand your fear. Understand past market moves to gain a better understand of how much the market can move. He looks at past mistakes to motivate him and teach him before he starts work every day to ground him. Cut losses early ride profits longer. People are hopeful when they’re losing money and fearful when they’re making it. People trade fear and hope not the markets. Adding to a winning trade is the mark of a grade trader you cut the fear of taking profit. Act contrary to human nature. It’s easier to add to a losing not a winning position but we should do the opposite of human nature. The normal thing is to take profits not double down but you must double down that’s the key to success because it’s counter to human nature. Add to winning trades and use a stop loss and don’t add to losing trades and don’t take half profits. Taking half profits limits your home runs. Losers spend time thinking about how much they can make on a trade winners how much they can lose always control downside. In bull markets, resistance is often broken and in fair markets support rarely holds. Give up paper gains to capture bigger moves. Add to winners is embracing pain do what makes you feel uncomfortable. Listen to the part of your mind not controlled by fear run through the fear. Don’t but bargains buy good things at fair prices. Don’t trade the trend reversal.
- Don’t be afraid and use the opioid of hope. Visualize the worst case scenario it takes the energy from it. How desperately do you want this. You gotta wanna die for it and follow what gives you energy. We need to ask for help. We see things through our bias. We will only see what we want to see and what our mental models allow us to see. If we’re bullish we’ll chart a bullish chart and ignore other scenarios. We see what we want. Backtest a strategy and find what works for you. A friend of his made 25% a year by using a strategy with a 30% hit rate but in the back tests they knew the losses would be small and the winners large. Trading is a balance between humility and arrogance. Find the strategy that works for you. Success comes from knowing yourself changing your mind is tough but we must do so. Mental flexibility reprogram your mind. Our mind plays tricks on us and good trading is reprogramming your mind to mitigate your innate biases. Stock prices are in heruclitan flux. Constantly in motion not a stagnant creation. We like bargains in the real world but can’t rely on bargains in the market. Don’t buy bargains. Prices are never wrong. Things aren’t cheap or expensive they just are. Prices are just prices. The markets are human so to make money we need to reprogram our minds and defy human nature. The market doesn’t care about your feelings. Success only comes when you surrender to the market.
- Your mentality in a trade is your differentiation. We love shortcuts. Choose the path of most resistance because that’s easier in the long run. Mindset trumps all. Don’t think because you made or lost yesterday you should act differently. Move on from yesterday do not let it continue to inhabit your mind. The past doesn’t matter wipe the mind slate clean or else you’ll be out of balance. Be present don’t try to get back to an emotional equilibrium. You can’t trade against yourself from yesterday everything must be assed on its own merit or else you’re losing. Forget mistakes and move on. Wipe your mind move on and be present. That was tiger woods edge. Cognitive dissonance is mental discomfort or stress coming from holding 2 differing beliefs in your head triggered by a person belief that is confronted by new facts. We want to be internally consistent. This leads us to riding losses but selling wins. This leads us to act irrationally like closing a good position early to bring us back into balance. Fear drives us. Everything we want lives on the other side of fear yet fear is a necessity. Minds protect us against pain. We need to slowly introduce trauma to surpass change. You need to give your mind time to stay balanced work up to trading bigger size like running a marathon. Positive visualization and confront fear head on. Fear is an absence of knowledge. Live in the edge of life. Don’t be afraid of making mistakes. Failure is a friend embrace and grow from it. Own up to your errors and then be done with it. Embrace failure. That’s a healthy thought pattern. Don’t be afraid of losing.
- Don’t think like everyone else or you are everyone else. Normal is constantly educating yourself looking for an edge. You must read a technical analysis book but reading a book on technical analysis doesn’t make you a pro anymore than a tennis manual makes you nadal. Don’t just buy because the indicators seem positive when your mentality is screaming sell. You need to understand the rules then break them. You need to think the right way about the market not make money. Everyone has good and bad spells in trading. It’s about knowing how to lose. When you go on tilt you’re fucked. Emotions are response driven. You need to learn hoe to lose. When you fall in love with someone you feel strong emotions your inner life is in beautiful turmoil you just want to be united with that person over time that passion is replaced by loving calm. You become habituated to the situation less intense passion. Spend 75% of time on technical analysis and 25% on internal analysis need introspection to be successful. He doesn’t sell winners. He’s a big momentum dint try to buy the lows don’t blindly trust charts.
- How you feel about failure defines your life. He’s shaped his mind for success. His skills are average but his mentality is elite. Technical analysis needs behavioral training. It’s too outcome not processed focused. Losing is part of trading. To become a good trader you need more than TA. You need great TA to trade well good risk management and stop losses but mentality wins the day always. That’s the differentiator. Dont confuse luck with skill especially early on. Successful trading has a big effect on your brain and your brain chemistry some trader turned 5k into 8mm but they lost all 8mm. Need the mindset to keep winning. His success was because he worked harder than everyone 40 hours of overtime a week. Mastering the market is having a hold on your psychology. People aren’t rational so the market isn’t rational. Trading is very emotional. Panic buying holding onto losses ect. It’s all emotion Good traders trade in size hold onto winners longer than losers don’t get out quickly. Use stop losses don’t over trade. Add to winners not losers. Brokers do everything to help people make money but people self sabotage and lose. 80% of traders lose money. The average are losers. How can we transcend. You need a great plan but you need a transcendent mentality. Normal doesn’t cut it. It’s not strategy that sets you apart it’s how much you can follow the strategy. You can’t think like everyone else.
