  She advises them not only on their clothes, but also how to run their businesses. In turn, they are rewarded with coverage in the magazine and more important, Anna's personal support and advice. And she doesn't wait for the next generation of fashion designers to emerge. She financially supports them through the Council of Fashion Designers of America, Vogue Fashion Fund. That support can be the difference between unimaginable success and bankruptcy. Editors of Vogue were powerful before Anna had that job, but she's expanded that power remarkably, making herself a brand that powerful people want to be associated with. How she speaks, hires, fires, eats, and shops are both topics of obsession and scrutiny. When Anna asks for something, she usually wants it done immediately. Despite the fact that her work emails to her staff go out at all hours, it can be addicting working for her. Other people that work with her praise her directness. You always know where you stand with her, and that's better than working for someone who might want to know about your kid's birthday party, but can't make up their mind about a headline. She has to be involved in everything. Anna controls all that she can, right down to the ingredients in the food at the Met Gala. And maybe most importantly of all, she knows the ecosystem in which she operates better than anyone. That was an excerpt from the book I'm going to talk to you about today, which is Anna, the biography and is written by Amy Odell.

Kobe was never afair don’t defer show strength. Anna was the same personality. Grew up rich in a old school English house and her dad was a newspaper editor. Her dad planted the idea of editor of vogue which was the top of the top. She drops out of school at 16 and moves to the us to blaze her own path at 18. She was identified by the man who ran vogue as a great talent and invented a job for her to bring her in.

  She comes back to New York to edit House and Garden for a few months before Newhouse offered her the job that her father had chosen all those years ago. Mirabella, this is so ruthless, Mirabella learned on TV that she had been fired. Lieberman and Newhouse leaped it to the press instead of telling her and she had worked. Grace Mirabella, if I'm not mistaken, had worked at Vogue for 37 years. That is a ruthless. Winter's position hasn't always been secure. In the wake of the 1990 recession, Vogue's ad pages fell. Newhouse advised Winter, which who was sometimes resonant about resident about featuring advertisers, products and her pages to follow the money. And she did. Now, fast forward to present day, it is probable that Conde Nast cannot afford to lose her. Advertisers run ads in Vogue, not only because they think it will sell clothes, but also to secure Winter's favor and advice. And this is kind of crazy. Vogue actually sells something called the Vogue 100. It is a private club whose members pay $100,000 a year just for access to Anna. Delegation is not among Anna's managerial talents. She is notorious for controlling every last detail. God is in the details, she replies. I am not a creative person. I cannot draw. I cannot sketch. I cannot make anything. I just have to make sure things are done right. Okay, so now I want to go back to the biography. I want to go right into her childhood and the influence that her father had. ([Time 0:18:38](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4ac00dd1-bf94-47a4-9fd9-5243b5882a3d))
    - **Note:** She’s not creative but an operator who is in the details and doesn’t delegate. Her dad was a strong headed man ego was feared and respected by all and a leader in the news room. Instilled bullet proof discipline in Anna quick decisive and ruthless. She’s the master of the terse memo. Ogilvy believed in the dogma of brevity. She’s constantly reading and disciplined she wants to be special from a young age. Very disciplined and conforms strictly to her diet. Very clear with her motives and easy to interface with. Judgements of others were ruthless worse with herself. She didn’t want to exist within groups but invent her own. Everything she did even from a teenager was in service in her mission. She was about learning information she didn’t want execution tips she was thrown in at the deep end early in her career. She was a perfectionist thrusted in a sea of ignorance but had belief in herself so people believed and followed her. She was a strong and domeneering leader.
- She recognized early that she did not want to be the person out in the field, creating the content, but the person in the office making decisions, just like her father

  She recognized early that she did not want to be the person out in the field, creating the content, but the person in the office making decisions, just like her father, I want to be the One in charge. She also did something very smart at a young age. She realized that the physical location she is in should match her ambition levels. She thought she was that the fashion industry in London was like the backwater. And I need to get to New York because she thought that New York was the center of the universe. And so she's going to work in New York for a long time. Then she's going to go send back to London. But anytime she send back to London, she knows it's temporary. I have to be in New York because New York is the center of the universe and it fuels her ambition even greater, even more. And this is one of the things I respect about her most. She just had a singular purpose. And she knew what her mission was. And she put all of her energy into accomplishing that mission, mission, all her energy into what the direction that she was going, how she felt about Vogue is how I feel about founders, Right? Ana had one concern when she was on the job and it wasn't adopting friendly American manners. Her focus was singular. She was very clear-minded about wanting to do work that she thought was the best. Over and over again, they're going to talk about people that interact with her. Like they can't believe her work ethic. They were in awe of Ana's work ethic. She really had no qualms about being completely focused. She was just on her path to what she needed to do. Period. The end. In an office, people kind of clown around. ([Time 0:31:59](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d71c9a79-2398-4a22-a38c-96774d7c6c01))
    - **Note:** She was singularly focused wanted to run vogue in the biggest market America. She didn’t clown around or gossip just worked hard. She wasn’t in it for the fun and games all work this is when she’s 26. Nyc matched her ambition and intensity always her own person and her own boss. She was a yardstick of quality and high standards over everything. She was focused on work and the great work she did at smaller magazines got her bigger jobs. She would kill stories quickly. Anna makes decisive quick decisions easy to understand the old editor was there for 10 hours making unclear comments Anna decided quickly. She gets sent to run London vogue and fires a lot of people so she can have control and change the culture this is how she gets the ice queen nickname. She reviewed the shoots before they happened and made her org ruthlessly efficient and made everyone work longer more efficiently but also paid them more all of which didn’t happen under the old administration

  And it says the pages of the issue in this room, you actually see this in the documentary, it's called the September issue, where all the pictures are what's about to go on the issue, right? They're all put up on a board, usually in order. And then they also have this thing called the book where like they print out, looks like almost like a like a homemade copy of the issue they're working on. And it's delivered to Anna's house every night. And then she like leaves notes on it and brings it back the next day. It's in the movie, The Devil Wears Prada 2. But anyways, they have this board in vogue where like you put everything up. And there's oftentimes where like there's something going in the magazine and it says Mirabella didn't know the names of some of the people in the artists featured in an own magazine. And you have people saying I was shocked at what Grace didn't know that there's no way that's going to happen with Anna Winter. And again, one thing that Grace didn't understand is that relationships run the world. Mirabella had another problem that Anna did not a nearly non-existent relationship with Sai Newhouse, the owner of the company, the ultimate decision maker, and you're not making A relationship with him. That is a massive mistake. She never grew comfortable with him and intentionally avoided him. And if Mirabella wasn't inside Newhouse's ear as the singular voice and authority on Vogue, who would be? That was Anna Winter. And so Anna immediately takes over so it's making changes. ([Time 0:47:21](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ee632559-8ab7-4535-b154-ad4381652ac8))
    - **Note:** Relationships run the world mirabella didn’t have the ear of psy Newhouse who owned vogue relationships run the world cultivate them. She also didn’t have a deep understanding of her craft. Concise compress your thoughts. Constraints force you to get to the essence.

She saw the power in combining and centralizing the industry to create a more valuable system. She gave awards to young designers who were in turn grateful to her.

  Speaker 1
  Anna's like, well, these are my standards. This is what I expect of you. And if you can survive, then that's great. But if not, she will ruthlessly cut these people out. And a lot of it is just because there isn't a lot of kind of American cultures like, hey, how you doing? And there's like this, there's like an introduction before we get to the actual point. Anna skips over all that. She just goes right to the point. Talked about earlier how the fact that she sends constant emails to her assistants all day long. And you can tell that she wants to get to the point because they don't even have a subject line. But what was fascinating is she walks into the office. As soon as she goes into the office, she just starts speaking. It's not like, hey, good morning anything like that. They are expected to have like a blank word document up because as soon as she walks in the door, they have to start furiously typing everything she says as soon as she walks in because As soon as she arrives, she just starts talking and issuing to dues without periods or pauses. And you see this also in the movie, The Devil Wears Prada. And so a large part of this book also, you know, saying that they're trying to tell you the other side of this.
