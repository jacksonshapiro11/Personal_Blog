### Highlights

- Episode AI notes
  1. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang emphasizes the importance of a perfect chip for the success of the company. They thoroughly tested and simulated the chip before production, showcasing their commitment to ensuring its quality. Despite doubts and skepticism from others, NVIDIA's strategy of taking risks has paid off so far. They also analyze the success of deep learning and question the factors behind it.
  2. NVIDIA differentiates itself in the market by addressing emerging needs and positioning itself for future markets. They entered the automotive industry with software-defined cars, despite doubts about its necessity at the time. Having a clear vision of the future and identifying potential markets before they become established can lead to success. Non-consumption also presents opportunities for growth and innovation.
  3. Building NVIDIA turned out to be much more challenging than expected, but the founder believes in tricking oneself into thinking it's not that hard. Surrounding oneself with unwavering support from family, friends, and colleagues is crucial in enduring the challenges. Writing a traditional business plan is not as important as identifying the true problem and unmet needs.

  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And so we got in our head that we have a perfect chip.
  Speaker 3
  How much of this was you and how much of this was like your co-founders, the rest of the company, the board, was everybody telling you you were crazy?
  Speaker 4
  No, everybody was clear. We had no shot.
  Speaker 6
  Not doing it would be crazy because otherwise you might as well go home. You're going to do business anyways.
  Speaker 1
  So anything aside from that is crazy. So it seemed like a fairly logical thing and quite frankly, right now, I'm describing it. Everybody's you're probably thinking, yeah, it's pretty sensible.
  Speaker 5
  Well, it worked. Yeah.
  Speaker 1
  And so we take that out and went directly to production.
  Speaker 2
  So is the lesson for founders out there when you have conviction on something like the Revo 128 or Kuda go bet the company on it? And this keeps working for you. So it seems like your lesson learned from this is, yes, keep pushing all the chips in because so far it's worked every time. No, how do you think about that?
  Speaker 1
  No, no, when you push your chips in, I know it's going to work. Notice we assume that we taped out a perfect chip. The reason why we taped out a perfect chip is because we emulated the whole chip before we taped it out. We developed the entire software stack.
  Speaker 4
  We ran QA on all the drivers and all the software.
  Speaker 6
  We ran all the games we had.
  Speaker 4
  We ran every VGA application we had. And so when you push your chips in, what you're really doing is when you bet the form, you're saying, I'm going to take everything in the future, all the risky things.
  Speaker 1
  And I pull in advance. And that is probably the lesson. And to this day, everything that we can prefetch, everything in the future that we can simulate today, we prefetch it.
  Speaker 3
  We talk about this a lot. We're just talking about this on our Costco episode. You want to push your chips in when you know it's going to work.
  Speaker 2
  So every time we see you make the company move, you've already simulated it. You know, do you feel like that was the case with Kuda?
  Speaker 6
  Yeah.
  Speaker 1
  In fact, before that was Kuda, there was a CG. Right. And so we were already playing with the concept of how do we create an abstraction layer above our chip that is expressible in a higher level language and a higher level expression. And how can we use our GPU for things like CT reconstruction, image processing? We were already down that path. And so there were some positive feedback and some intuitive positive feedback that we think that that general purpose computing could be possible. And if you just looked at the pipeline of a programmable shader, it is a processor and is a highly parallel and it is massively threaded and it is the only processor in the world that does That. And so there were a lot of characteristics about programmable shading that would suggest that Kuda has a great opportunity to succeed.
  Speaker 2
  And that is true if there was a large market of machine learning practitioners who would eventually show up and want to do all this great scientific computing and accelerated computing. But at the time when you were starting to invest, what is now something like 10,000 person years in building that platform? Did you ever feel like, oh man, we might have invested ahead of the demand for machine learning since we're like a decade before the whole world is realizing it?
  Speaker 1
  I guess yes and no. You know, when we saw deep learning, when we saw AlexNet and realized it's incredible effectiveness and computer vision, we had the good sense, if you will, to go back to first principles And ask, you know, what is it about this thing that made it so successful? When a new software technology, a new algorithm comes along and somehow leapfrogs 30 years of computer vision work, you have to take a step back and ask yourself, but why? ([Time 0:10:17](https://share.snipd.com/snip/82b7914d-6f6a-4112-9fc8-f1238190eb24))
    - **Note:** Riva 128 was a compeny reset they had 1 shot to be the company so they tested everything in prod and emulated it so they could produce a perfect chip in half the time. They didn’t have time for the full cycle they still use that approach it had to be perfect or they were out of business. They then saw alexnet and started building for ML realized that people cared more about inference than causality. Sees organization as the machinery of building the product so set up nvidia as a computer which each leader like a module best served to solving that problem. No one has privileged information and the leaders are there because they’re the best to solve the problem. They saw the sesperation of data centers from computers and started building toward that. They see the future then start to slowly angle their bodies towards that future building capabilities so when the moment is right they have a good system. Nvidia sees where the ball is going they’re positioned right that’s why the melenox acquisition was so perfect they saw you needed a new architecture for ML and they saw this company had a monopoly on it before anyone else knew the gane was on.
- Positioning in Emerging Markets
  Key takeaways:
  - There are different ways to think about competition.
  - Positioning oneself in a way that serves an emerging need can be beneficial.
  - Identifying and targeting potential future markets can lead to success.
  - Entering a market before it becomes established can lead to questions and skepticism.
  - Having a clear vision of the future can help overcome doubts and objections.
  - Non-consumption can present opportunities for growth and innovation.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Well, there are all kinds of ways to think about competition. We prefer to position ourselves in a way that serves a need that usually hasn't emerged.
  Speaker 3
  I've heard that you are others in NVIDIA. I think you've separated zero billion dollar markets. Yeah, that's exactly right.
  Speaker 1
  It's our way of saying there's no market yet, but we believe there will be one. And usually when you're positioned there, everybody's trying to figure out why are you here? Right? Because when we first got into automotive, because we believe that in the future, the car is going to be largely software. And if it's going to be largely software, a really incredible computer is necessary. And so when we positioned ourselves there, most people, I still remember one of the CTOs told me, you know what, cars cannot tolerate the blue screen of death. I don't think anybody can tolerate that, but that doesn't change the fact that someday every car will be a software-defined car. And I think 15 years later, we're largely right. So oftentimes there's non-consumption, and we like to navigate our company there. ([Time 0:46:27](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d8a7ca9d-b79b-4323-ac96-1259b8af356f))
    - **Note:** Position for $0bn markets to grow into. Seeing around corners and building for the future. Ai and ml started as data centers and distributed computing at the company. They had a 10 year head start in this stuff. Started out as a video game platform company. Success is about doing the right things and getting lucky. They made all their architecture interoperable from the start. Key insight around chip design they redid the process’s cause they had to ended up being right. Jobs will be effected by AI BUT PEOPLE should learn Ai and grow using it to position themselves to work in the future. Technology and markets are constantly expanding into more creativity and jobs.
- LSI Logic's Impact on the Computer Industry and the Importance of Writing a Business Plan
  Key takeaways:
  - The speaker witnessed a major industry revolution while working at LSI Logic
  - Writing a traditional business plan is not considered important, focusing on identifying the true problem and unmet needs is crucial
  - Building a company is extremely challenging and harder than anticipated
  - Entrepreneurs often underestimate the difficulties and have the ability to trick themselves into believing it's not so hard
  - Having a strong support system, including family, friends, and colleagues, is vital for enduring the emotional trauma of building a company
  Transcript:
  Speaker 4
  I thought that was the best thing I ever happened to the industry and I was really happy to be part of it. I was at ground zero.
  Speaker 1
  So I saw one industry change revolutionize another industry.
  Speaker 4
  If not for LSI logic doing the work that it did, synopsis shortly after, then why would the computer industry be where it is today?
  Speaker 1
  It's really, really terrific.
  Speaker 4
  I was at the right place at the right time to see all that. That's super cool.
  Speaker 3
  It sounded like the CEO of LSI Logic put a good word for you with Don Valentine.
  Speaker 6
  I didn't know how to write a business plan.
  Speaker 2
  It turns out it's not actually important. No.
  Speaker 1
  It turns out that making a financial forecast that nobody knows is going to be right or wrong turns out not to be that important. But the important things that a business plan probably could have teased out. I think that the art of writing a business plan out would be much, much shorter and it forces you to condense. What is the true problem you're trying to solve? What is the unmet need that you believe will emerge? What is it that you're going to do that is sufficiently hard that when everybody else finds out is a good idea, they're not going to swarm it and make you obsolete. It has to be sufficiently hard to do. There are a whole bunch of other skills that are involved in product and positioning and pricing and go to market and all that kind of stuff. But those are skills and you can learn those things easily. The stuff that is really, really hard is the essence what I described. I did that. I had no idea how to write a business plan. I was fortunate that Wolf Corrigan was so pleased with me and the work that I did when I was at Ellis on Logic.
  Speaker 4
  He called on Don Valentine and told Don, invest in this kid.
  Speaker 1
  He's going to come your way. I was set up for success from that moment and got us on the ground.
  Speaker 2
  As long as he didn't lose the money.
  Speaker 5
  I think Sequoia did okay. I think we probably are one of the best investments they've ever made.
  Speaker 2
  Have they held through today?
  Speaker 4
  The VC partner is still on the board. Mark Stevens. Yeah, Mark.
  Speaker 5
  Yeah.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah.
  Speaker 6
  All these years.
  Speaker 1
  The two founding VCs are still on the board. Sutter Hill and Sequoia? Yeah. Tenchcocks and Mark Stevens. I don't think that ever happens. We're singular in that circumstance, I believe. They've had a value this whole time.
  Speaker 4
  I've been inspiring this whole time.
  Speaker 1
  I gave great wisdom and great support. They also were so counter-tent. They've been entertained by the company, inspired by the company and enriched by the company. They stayed with it. I'm really grateful.
  Speaker 3
  In that vein, our final question for you, it's 2023, 30 years anniversary of the founding of Nvidia. If you were magically 30 years old again today in 2023 and you were going to Denny's, went to two best friends who were the two smartest people you know and you're talking about starting A company, what are you talking about starting? I wouldn't do it. I know.
  Speaker 1
  The reason for that is really quite simple. Ignoring the company that we would start. First of all, I'm not exactly sure. The reason why we do it and it goes back to why it's so hard is building a company and building a video turned out to have been a million times harder than I expected it to be. Any of us expected it to be. At that time, if we realized the pain and suffering and just a vulnerable you're going to feel and the challenges that you're going to endure, the embarrassment and the shame and the List of all the things that go wrong, I don't think anybody would start a company. Nobody in their right mind would do it. I think that that's kind of the superpower of a entrepreneur.
  Speaker 4
  They don't know how hard it is and they only ask themselves how hard can it be. To this day, I trick my brain into thinking how hard can it be because you have to.
  Speaker 6
  Still, you wake up in the morning. How hard can it be?
  Speaker 1
  Everything that we're doing. How hard can it be? On the verse, how hard can it be?
  Speaker 3
  I don't get the sense though that you're playing to retire anytime soon. You could choose to say like, whoa, this is too hard.
  Speaker 2
  The trick is still working.
  Speaker 1
  You're still working. I'm still enjoying myself immensely and I'm adding a little bit of value. That's really the trick of an entrepreneur. You have to get yourself to believe that it's not that hard because it's way harder than you think. If I go taking all of my knowledge now and I go back and I said, I'm going to endure that whole journey again, I think it's too much.
  Speaker 4
  It is just too much.
  Speaker 2
  Do you have any suggestions on any kind of support system or a way to get through the emotional trauma that comes with building something like this?
  Speaker 1
  I have family and friends and all the colleagues we have here. I'm surrounded by people who've been here for 30 years. Right? Chris has been here for 30 years and Jeff Fisher has been here 30 years, Dwight's been here 30 years and Jonah and Brian have been here 25 some years and probably longer than that. And Joe Greco has been here 30 years. I'm surrounded by these people that never one time gave up and they never one time gave up on me. That's the entire ball of wax and to be able to go home and have your family be fully committed to everything that you're trying to do and think or think they're proud of you and proud of The company and you kind of need that.
  Speaker 4
  You need the unwavering support of people around you. Jim Gaithers and the Tenge Coxes and Mark Stevens and Harvey Jones and all the early people of our company, the Bill Miller's, they not one time gave up on the company and us and you kind ([Time 1:16:54](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a2cb250f-8629-41e4-baed-8de20e92b135))
    - **Note:** Business model what problem are you trying to solve and how is your solution defensible. True problem unmet need you’re solving what are you doing that’s sufficiently hard for a moat. The skills you can learn that core insight is hard. The trick of an entrepreneur is just believing something isn’t that hard. You need a strong support system their decisions on Cuda made them trade down to 2bn despite this being what made them a 1 tr company. They’re in the manufacturing of intelligence space not semis. The world of tasks in measured in trillions. How many cars can need a chip is different than a system of autonomous choffeors. Market opportunity growing to task based.
