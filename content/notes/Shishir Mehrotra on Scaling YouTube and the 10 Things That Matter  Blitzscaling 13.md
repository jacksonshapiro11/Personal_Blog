    - **Note:** Do t presume others incentives just ask. A good decision is based on how long it sticks around and its staying power. Find key metrics that drive the business and focus on those helps frame discussion and ignore superfluous conversations. Promotions were given based on scope. Firstvsoneone executing a clearly defined problem 2nd coming up with the execution plan to a problem from a solution 3rd coming up with solutions from problems and lastly coming up with problems and questions aster watching a space. Generally not about linear growth first you grow in scope than you improve at how you do the job then improve in scope again. Dream team who would you hire first if you were starting a team. Broke into best performers hiring bar and wouldn’t hire again. Invest in top performers. 3 types of bad bosses over empathizer who works every problem with you micro manager and dictator. You need to balance these. Make a vision mission driven the janitor putting a man on the moon. Think about values early on and clarify them.
