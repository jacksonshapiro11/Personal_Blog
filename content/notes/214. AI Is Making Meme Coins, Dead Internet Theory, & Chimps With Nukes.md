  I mean, this, this little talk here has made me, there's a thing I think about a lot with myself, which is sort of to, to really condense it. It's like, am I, am I dreaming too small? Am I playing too small ball? Like everything I do very short term, like sometimes like, like five seconds short term, but even in like the craziest sense, like my time horizon for the sort of ideation of an idea to The exit of that idea, like even in the longest sense for me is like, it's like than a year in a lot of stuff, and then you live in a world where you are taking a significant chunk of your life And kind of swinging for the fences in a way.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, but it's also crazy to do that.
  Speaker 2
  Because you can walk away with absolutely nothing, and 10 years of your life is gone you know okay hit me with that hit me with that good stuff thank you i mean this kind of gets back to the Old like dentist rock star analogy we use a lot you know do you want to take a low variance path in life and guarantee sort of incremental success or do you want to chase like an audacious Low probability goal and to me like the dentist thing has always made sense and i think a lot of people might be like what do you mean because i do very not dentist stuff like i buy meme coins And i do all sorts of I take crazy risks like with like way more of my money than I should and that's very non-dentist right but it's like sort of dentist in the fact that like the ability To know where you stand very quickly like the the extreme of this is like scalping right when you're scalping you're trading like the one second chart on the nasdaq right you sometimes Are in a move where you've caught the bottom of a move that could go on for for for hours or even days right and if you held that move you could make hundreds of times the amount of money you Risk but in when you're scalping you train yourself to to get out of that thinking because most of those moves are not, in fact, the bottom of a trend that will reverse and make you tons Of money. Most of it is a temporary thing. You capture the meat. You take your profit. You close the trade. You move on. And if it goes for days and you could have made a million dollars risking $1, dollars on a trade, whatever, that's the business. Because if you keep chasing that, oh my God, this could be the bottom, this could be the bottom, this could be the bottom, and you hold like a huge move, like the market just keeps stopping You out. So you take your little win, you take your little win, you take your little win, and you wake up the next day and you do it again, you do it again, you do it again. So that's what I mean with the dentist thing is that like I'm just trying to think about where's the next move takes the next, take the next move and move on versus what you are doing is like, You are thinking like a decade in advance and trying to skate to where the puck is going. And you are taking all of this risk in terms of like your time. And you are thinking maybe in this way where there are like 20 different conditional ways that the market or everything could move and you're trying to like pivot and capture all that And it's really like a crazy thing and you're dreaming very big like you're not working for a decade to try to make like a hundred thousand dollars and then like go do the and that's crazy Like you're you're doing this to make many millions like at the end of it which you have to do in order to compensate yourself for risking so much of your life so much of your time for for Like kind of like an audacious vision and lately I've been wondering like have I gone too far in the other direction like am I now thinking too small am I valuing like time too much so an
  Speaker 1
  Hour ago I asked you about investing strategy and I said spray and pray or high conviction quantity over quality and you said it's a personality thing same shit I love the process of what I'm doing i know that i could walk away with nothing quote unquote um i love it because i don't think you walk away with nothing i think i'm in the pursuit of mastery i think i'm in the pursuit Of like the thing that i'm most curious about and i don't think you walk away with nothing i think you walk away with experience. And that experience is invaluable. And you can build on that. You can build on experience. It doesn't mean I'm going to walk away with nothing. You still have little wins along the way. You might not have the $100 million payout, but you have something. And then you do have a shot at building a moonshot. And your moonshot is incredibly exciting and i like playing a really big game on a long time horizon uh personally this is my personality but i also wasn't playing that game before i started Steno i was playing a different game so i've tasted different flavors of the game of life when it comes to like what a career should be and what a business can be. And I internally, like my intuition was always building the expertise and experience to feel confident enough to play the current game that I'm playing, if that makes sense. Like I knew deep down I always wanted this, but I felt like I needed to try a bunch of stuff and do, like, what Nick was doing and do what you were doing. Like, I've tried a lot of things, as you know, in the last, you know, decade or so. But, like, for me, and I did some consulting and all kinds of stuff, e-commerce. And I felt like it was all training wheels for this. Some people come out of Berkeley at 22 or drop out at 20 and go and do what I'm doing now. And they have that capability. I am an extractor. I'm a life maximizer. Need to learn a lot before i feel like i can really step into an arena and like conquer it that's just my i know myself that's my personality i always knew that about me so i just think it's Knowing who you are and playing the game of who you are it's never too late to play a different game. Some founders have big exits at 25. I haven't. That's okay. I cash flowed along the way, and I had a great life, and I traveled the world, and I did different things. I didn't play the tech venture game, but I like the game now, and it's never too late to do something different. Do you think that you should actually ([Time 1:09:00](https://share.snipd.com/snip/57546254-08e9-4824-97be-44738abd12c0))

- Embrace the Evolution: AI as Humanity's Partner
  Summary:
  The profound integration of AI into daily life is poised to redefine human experiences, particularly in content creation, where a significant proportion will be AI-generated, yet this is not inherently negative.
  Creativity is a derivative of prior knowledge and experiences, and AI will enhance the efficiency and quality of content remixing and generation. The perception of authenticity in the digital realm may shift, with AI producing hyper-personalized content that caters to individual preferences.
  This transformation suggests a democratization of knowledge, with universal access to vast information leading to a leveling up of human capability.
  AI's ability to analyze and synthesize data could surpass human intelligence, driving solutions for complex societal challenges like climate change and health issues.
  Despite concerns about the proliferation of AI-generated content and the potential loss of human touch, the future holds the promise of innovative experiences, real-time data interfaces, and the emergence of a collective intellectual advancement. The rise of AI will compel humanity to adapt and embrace a new paradigm, ultimately enriching life and offering exciting possibilities for the future.

  We already kind of do but in this world i i see that just just going into the complete overdrive right like do do you not do you not think this is bad if we are just living in this online world
  Speaker 1
  Where nothing we are interacting with is real none of the people are actually human i mean like first and foremost the content that AI is generating is a derivative of all human knowledge. The human knowledge that was created was a derivative of previous human knowledge. All people stand on the shoulders of the giants that came before them. And so no ideas are original. To what degree of creativity, I think what we're really talking about when we talk about this stuff is the human soul. Creativity, maybe some people would rather call it, that don't like the word soul. What is it that makes human human? Well, maybe there's a muse that you tap into when you write the article or the essay, or you think about the music. And that is what we would like to hold on to. And I think we will. We will have human generated content that will be a premium. And it will be awesome, and some people will love it. But I believe and I agree that 95% of content will be AI-generated. But what does that mean? All that means is taking the remixing that all those people were doing by outsourcing to the Philippines and doing the SEO work that you described and writing articles, but doing it Better. It's going to be better. You know why? Because AI is smarter than us. And it will be soon, generally speaking. It's passing exams that most people can't pass. Average intelligence of a human being is already surpassed. It will surpass, generally speaking, multimodally, all intelligence of all human beings. And so like, we're not far from that. That's going to happen in this decade. And then we're going to have the opportunity to actually like have brain interface experiences where our brains are fully merged with the internet. Well, what is the internet? The internet is literally the store of all human knowledge and consciousness that human knowledge and consciousness will continue to get developed by ai organized improved have This have try this here yeah i actually i want some of that do you have a cup for us are you going to put that in the same cup you put your wine? Yes.
  Speaker 2
  That is going to be interesting. Nika from the barrel. Nika from the barrel with what? Nika from the French oak barrel.
  Speaker 1
  It was a 2016, for those who were wondering. It was very good. Grippy Tannins was one of the reviews.
  Speaker 2
  I could definitely see why we were supposed to decant it for five hours.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, yeah. It was. It needed to.
  Speaker 2
  I should probably read this stuff before I buy them. It was a little tight. It was tight. I wanted to express.
  Speaker 1
  Tight like a tiger. Impress itself a little more. It did its work, though. It did its work in my mouth. So, you know, I just think that ai is so foreign to people but it's not you you created it ai ai is a derivative of everything you and i are that's all it is It's a technology that is trained To perform on all human knowledge. Now, this data training that we talked about earlier will continue to improve. And by the way, what they're finding is it has nothing, these LLMs, their level of growth, the trajectory of growth is not related to parameters. It's related to just data, good data, good human data, the ability to continuously like find and scrape and develop new data. But, you know, that eventually will, you know, there's a curve and that curve will eventually like fizzle out. There won't be data to scrape and pull and every year though we develop new data obviously right with current events and new knowledge and new essays and new studies we develop new data So we're continuously adding to that data but also we need to continue to train data based on pre-existing data that we're scraping and that takes billions and billions of dollars. Sounds like Donald Trump. Billions and billions of dollars. But this is the gift of AI. AI is taking all of that from the Internet and turning it into something real, turning it into something agentic, turning it into something autonomous, turning it into something that Will eventually you'll be able to really talk to and will be a brain hive of its own and then we're going to be able to just truly merge an interface with that so i'm not concerned about ai Generated content at all i think the majority of video, YouTube that you watch will be completely personalized and generated on the fly for you. You will prompt and say, I want to learn how to create a podcast that I can monetize that does this, that does that, that is in this niche, that does that. And you'll just get a freaking video that is just like in the voice that you prefer from 11 labs in the length that you prefer because that's the way you learn, with the charts that you need Because that's the way you learn. Boom. Just like, that's fucking amazing. But that is all temporary because then you have brain internet data interface in the early 2030s, according to Ray Kurzweil. And that's when we drop the necessity to actually sit there and listen and learn something. That's when it's just like you're interfacing with it on a real-time level. And you have access to all the knowledge that ever is and ever will be. And all of humanity does as well, by the way. All of humanity will be truly accessing that democratized knowledge. So what happens? Everybody levels up. Anyone with an internet connection, which is everybody, levels up. So what happens to humanity? We're in the fucking singularity is what happens. That's the singularity. That's it. It's like 2030s, we're in the singularity. So I don't see at this point how we don't get there. Humanity, life is fucking exciting, man. The things we're going to see are so wild and exciting.
  Speaker 2
  Like, I'm so ready for it. All right. I just gave you a rather dystopian ([Time 1:34:58](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a2df06bd-96a1-4198-8fea-cd53f97fc024))
