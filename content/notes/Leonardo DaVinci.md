### Highlights

- Talent hits a target no one else can hit genius hits a target no one else can see. Genuine curiosity and learning for learnings sake. No payoff needed just want to know why. Very observant looked at details from the ground up very observant and curious. Fearless about changing our minds making perfect the enemy of good he never even finished the Mona Lisa always making changes until he died

    - **Note:** Constant improvement and never satisfied always looking for something better. To grow - great quote on Talent vs Genius. Observant fearless first principals thinker. Curiosity has its own reason for being. Perfect enemy of good.
- Used patterns to reason from how blood flows through the body to how water flows through the earth but then realized he was wrong and completely changed his thinking. Radically open minded willing to throw everything out that didn’t work.

    - **Note:** Da Vinci was both willing to do the work more than anyone and willing to throw it all out when it didn't conform. He was greedy in his truth seeking and relentless in his drive.
      Change your mind reason by analogy
- Reasoned by analogy which helped his cross disciplinary thinking be seeing things similar to other things in other places ie another one of those. Discovered how blood flowed through the heart 450 years before anyone else and did it through reason and experiment. He didn’t study circulation because he accepted the book materials he had read instead of going in with no biases and searching objectively for the truth. Demonstrates how even the most open minded can be consumed by bias when they don’t check their opinions and challenge reality. He failed to think different because he was too learned. Wanted to accumulate knowledge for knowledge sake did not need to publish or be recognized

    - **Note:** Da Vinci reasoned by analogy but even he fell victim to some of his engrained biases. Even the most open minded can be blinded when they don’t check their bias. Being too learned can be a downside because the bias is engrained. He loved learning for learning sake. Had a thick desire to acquire knowledge
- Ahead of his time maybe too much so but sometimes fantasy’s are paths to reality
    - **Tags:** #favorite, #fantasy-is-a-path-to-reality, #visionary-vs-zealot
    - **Note:** Fantasy is a path to reality only the crazy can really survive
- With Leonardo he had people in his studio and paint variations of his painting of ideas he had so he could see if they made sense before implementing
    - **Tags:** #experimentation, #increase-learning-rate, #lower-the-cost-of-innovation, #test-and-scale
    - **Note:** Leonardo would experiment before testing in prod
- Extremes are to be avoided. In this painting he captured the idea of one pupil dialating more than another because it was facing more away from the light more ideas of his perfection and science informing his art
- Leonardo painted the rocks with such accuracy that the flowers only appeared in the areas in which they could’ve developed after the stones had been weathered and they were correct in seasonality as well. Painting shows not only his skill as a painter but his knowledge of geology light and botany

    - **Note:** Leonardo did not only have technical talent but what he did was incredibly well researched and objectively correct. Talent hits targets others can’t hit genius hits targets others can’t see. Real genius
- Measured all body parts of hundreds of men to find proportions within the body abs how lose changed with movement obsessive curiosity

    - **Note:** Leonard was ruthlessly curious and obsessive about his craft. Going above and beyond what everyone else did to reveal the secrets of the mind and body.
- Proportion found in numbers weights sounds everywhere was interested in rates of change not just absolutes
    - **Tags:** #rates-pf-change->-absolute, #compounding
- A cute observations questioning dogma and cross disciplinary learning. Understand the first principles is the ground starter for understanding anything
  Used experiments to inform theory pioneered scientific method

- Needed to paint 2 things a man abs his mind. 2 games going on constantly. Brain and nerves turning emotions into motions
  Leonardo went back to a painting after 20 years to perfect the neck muscle. He never finished things because he needed to dig in every single detail and get it perfect. Constantly asking why and not knowing drove him to demand abs sometimes achieve perfection what was perfect to some was left unfinished by others. In adoration of the magi he needed to make everyone’s reaction conducive to everyone else’s as one cohesive schene

    - **Note:** Da Vinci needed perfection and would go back to paintings after years when he had learned something new to improve what he had done. He was infinitely curious and a lifelong learner who pushed himself to be the best version of himself. Constantly improving and asking why not happy with a great picture but getting the social dynamics and physical features perfect everywhere. Tied in biology psychology physics and art to his works. 
      Pictures were a complex system. Man perfected everything constantly curious
- Leonardo didn’t take things at face value. He used different better paint he played with shadows he didn’t use straight lines he explored perspective in only a way someone who constantly thinks about perspective could
    - **Tags:** #deep-understanding-of-craft, #second-level-thinking, #natural-curiosity
    - **Note:** Leonardo saw and experimented with different things to deepen his understanding always naturally curious
- No formal schooling learned through experience and experiment
    - **Tags:** #self-starter, #experts, #experimentation, #bias-(inherent-in-models)
    - **Note:** He did not have any bias but a thrist for learning
- The ability to make connections across disciplines is a key to innovation imagination and genius. Like Ben Franklin self taught hard worker. Calling him a genius undersells him. He could barely read very strong curiosity and intense observation strong imagination and excitable thought about so many things. Married observation and innovation. Go to the source level 0. He was a misfit bastard child left handed gay vegetarian heretical intense adhd with demons he turned into drags. Connected disciplines through his creativity. The times flourished because they accepted people like him not rejected him because he was different

    - **Note:** Da Vinci wasn’t objectively that smart, but he was a genius because he needed to understand things from first principles and married intense curiosity with observation. The Renaissance was so powerful because it allowed people like da Vinci to have a platform when he would’ve been minimalized because of his background before. Connectionist knowledge idea.
