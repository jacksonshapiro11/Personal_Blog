### Highlights

- Steve was religiously dedicated to simplicity. Simplicity helps you scale. Steve would hit things with the simple stock when they weren’t simple enough. He is very simple and easy to understand when he communicates. When he saw a product he would be give clear and blunt communication with high standards. Easy to interface with. High absolute standards. Put conflict over agreement would rather be blunt and argue to get closer to the answer than be liked. If you rambled he’d cut you off if you were slow he’d fire you. He would respond to emails in one line in 10 seconds to complex questions with clear direction. That helped Apple move very fast and win. Small teams. Simplicity small groups of smart people start up mentality reviewers all copy with no filters or guidance. ([Time 0:00:00](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9b89ba2a-41a4-42e0-816d-7494b514e00e))

- Embrace Small Groups of Smart People for Creativity
  Summary:
  Creating Apple ads involved only a handful of people deciding, showcasing the effectiveness of small groups.
  Steve Jobs limited team sizes to maintain efficiency and foster creativity, often questioning the presence of non-essential individuals in meetings. Both Jobs and Walt Disney shared the comfort of an absence of process in their creative endeavors, allowing for flexibility and spontaneity in decision-making.
  The essence of organizing small groups of smart people lies in the ability to innovate without strict processes, as seen in the collaborative and fluid approaches adopted by both Jobs and Disney in their groundbreaking projects.

  Speaker 1
  Ken talks about the amount of people in a meeting where they are literally deciding what what Apple ads the public is going to see. It's like there's a handful of people. He talks about other companies in the book where he'll count. There'll be like 32 people in the room. Steve Jobs would never allow that. There's stories in the book where if he notices a spectator to a meeting that is not essential, he will ask them why you hear. If there's not a good response, he'll make them leave. His best friend is small groups of smart people. So he did this in the beginning of his career. So his commitment to small groups of smart people sometimes included designing the team within constraints. So when he was building the first Mac, now she's in his twenties, he limited the team to 100 people. If you wanted to add a person, if you say, Hey, we need, you know, this person's help, you act, you first have to find the person that was unnecessary and replace them. And then I'm really glad that I reread this book after I just read the book on how Walt Disney built Disney land because I didn't understand the first time through without that additional Context that there's another benefit when it comes to just organizing your entire team or company into these small groups of smart people. Because if you're doing something new and creative, creativity is not a process. It's not scripted. And something that Steve had in common with Walt Disney was they were both comfortable with an absence of process. And so I want to read this excerpt to you from the book that I just did on episode three, 47, where, you know, the entire book is about how did Walt Disney build what he considered as masterpiece Was just Disney. And so we have a guy working for Walt Disney said, you asked the question, what was the process like? I kind of laugh because process is an organized way of doing things. I have to remind you during the Walt period of designing Disneyland, we didn't have processes. We just did the work process came later. All of these things had never been done before. Walt had gathered up all these people who had never designed a theme park. They had never designed a Disneyland. So we're in the same boat at one time and we figure out what to do and how to do it on the fly as we go along and not even discuss plans, timing or anything. We just worked and Walt just walked around and made suggestions. That's idea where Walt's just walking around and making suggestions. If you read all these books on Steve Jobs, it's very similar. There's an absence of process. Steve made suggestions, changes were made, then Steve would review the changes and make more suggestions.

    - **Note:** Creativity isn’t a process it’s often an absence of process and you need small deciated teams to tolerate ambiguity and come up with emergent plans. Process doesn’t exist early do the work process comes later. Steve trusted his taste and judgement. Would review process then make updates. Steve would make many crazy suggestions most of which didn’t happen but important to suggest and iterate. Crazy ideas are worth entertaining. For adds only focus on one important thing. You can’t mix messages when selling something new. Single message expressed clearly. The further you get from one the more complexity you invite in. Editing your thinking is an act of service. Edit thinking down to your essence. Very simple. Trust is one of the most important processes on earth. Simple is fast. Gil the old Apple ceo wanted to interview 20 ad agencies before picking one Steve called his friend trust scales and did the here’s to the crazy one ad in less time than it took to interview the 20 one of the best ads of all time.

  Speaker 1
  Why would he be former? I wonder why Valentine had just joined from Dr. Pepper. So, you know, a big, slow bureaucratic organization, no disrespect to them, right? And I just joined from Dr. Pepper when the marketing group met in January. You got to remember these dates January, the meeting in January to discuss a new television campaign. Valentine was ready with his timeline for producing spots. I'm going to try not to laugh already. We're meeting in January. So this is what he says. Okay. We're ready guys. Let's do this. We're going to write the script in March. Pardon me? Two months from now. We're going to write the script in March. We're going to get script approval in April. Remember we're in January for God's sake. We're going to write the script in March. We're going to get script approval in April. We're going to cast this commercial in June. What the? What are you doing? And we're going to shoot it in September when Valentine finished. Herb said, Don, I hate to tell you, but we're talking about next Wednesday. Not, we're not running this ad nine months from now. We're not going to take nine months. We're going to make an ad and it's going to be done and shot by next Wednesday. Simple as fast. And I think what the advice that Herb would give you and I think the advice that Steve would give you, if you feel you're not moving fast enough, narrow your scope, simplify and then up The intensity. And there's another thing that Herb and Steve had. This is the fifth thing I want to talk about. And this is another thing that they both had in common and it is how they taught. How they taught. There is a casual conversation with the ultimate decision maker. And the reason I thought about this section too, it's like, why would, why do I want to name this like how Steve taught? There's a great line from Jim Cinegal, who's the founder and former CEO of Costco. And he says, as a leader, if you're not spending 90% of your time teaching, you're not doing your job. What did Michael Jordan say? He was teaching. He was the leader of the team. He was teaching his team. There are certain standards that you live by. This is the Chicago bull way. This is the Apple way. This is the Southwest Airlines way. Jim Cinegal saying, this is how we do things at Costco. If you're not spending 90% of your time teaching, you're not doing your job. And the way Steve taught was through conversations. Says in the book, if you had this like slick presentation, this is internally. Okay. I'm going to do an entire new, the next episode will be about how Steve Jobs sold. And I'll tell you more about that in a minute. ([Time 0:32:02](https://share.snipd.com/snip/164cfd70-db1c-4822-b4aa-87baba72e962))
    - **Note:** Simple is fast narrow your scope increase your intensity. Leaders should spend 90% of your time teaching. Steve taught through conversations. Get to the essence don’t use 10 words when you can use one. Get distinct culture and get everyone marching in the same direction. Converse rather than present to people. Spot markets with second rate product. The hallmark of a second rate product is too complex. Make it so simple. Write down what your competitors are doing and force yourself to do it differently create new ways and new principles Hearst principle. Simple is harder than complex. Play a different game. Find a new and better way.
