### Highlights

- The Importance of Positioning in Decision Making
  Summary:
  The best decision makers in the world almost always operate from a position of strength. When you operate from a poor position, things almost always go from bad to worse. To what extent do you feel that's important? And maybe you could explore that with me. Like you, Shane, I try to reduce the complexities of the world to usable little rules, maxims, algorithms,. Heuristics, so that in the real time flux of life, I remember to do something and not some other time.

  How do we use it? Yeah, that's a key question for me. And the main thing I've been dying to talk to you specifically about given your knowledge of chess and decision making is sort of the concept of positioning. And I've been noodling on this idea. I think since we last spoke, actually, it's been a number of years and it seems to me that the best decision makers in the world almost always operate from a position of strength. And that sort of strikes me because when you operate from a solid position or foundation, nearly every move you make is good. It's all accumulative. Whereas when you operate from a poor position, things almost always go from bad to worse. To what extent do you feel that's important? And maybe you could explore that with me.
  Speaker 1
  Like you, Shane, I try to reduce the world, the complexities of the world to usable little rules, maxims, algorithms, heuristics, so that in the real time flux of life, I remember to do something and not, you know, some other time.

    - **Note:** Importance of always keeping yourself in a position of strength and constantly being on the front foot dictating the action. Don’t make decisions when you’re confused tired or stressed. Be aware of positions in which you excel. Chess vs poker perfect information focus on good decisions and reasoning vs imperfect info and reasoning. The innate feel of your body with a decision your street smarts. Does an investment feel right or a relationship feel right. Find the positions in which you excel and steer the game and your life that way. 2 ways to live life seek pleasure or avoid pain. Domain dependence is important if you lose money in investing it’s gone forever. When you lose a chess game you start fresh tomorrow
- The importance of asking questions and becoming a learning machine
  Summary:
  As human beings, we learn. And we should be learning every day. Machines are going to do that. You've got to know what questions to ask. It was a general patent who said, never tell your men how to do anything. Tell them what to do and let them surprise you with their ingenuity. To excel at anything, to do well in life, describe actually life as learning.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Think about school. The teacher asks the questions and the students raise their hand and give the answer. Machines are going to do that. You've got to know what questions to ask. It was a general patent who said, never tell your men how to do anything. Tell them what to do and let them surprise you with their ingenuity. Obviously, when you're executing in a battle, you just got to execute the command, right? But as managers, as bosses, as teachers, as parents in relationships, the more choice we can give the other person, which is to say the context, which is to say to go back to your work, the position.
  Speaker 2
  I like it. I want to switch gears a little bit and talk about how we become a learning machine.
  Speaker 1
  To excel at anything, to do well in life, describe actually life as learning. As human beings, we learn. And we should be learning every day.
  Speaker 2
  We should be learning every day. Yeah, you want to go to bed smarter than when you woke up.
  Speaker 1
  Yes, in concrete ways. Okay, I'm going to make an outrageous statement. I, Adam, know more about financial markets than any other living person. So that's an outrageous statement. How can I make that? I created software to test ideas about markets. Back in the day, if you had a question pre-internet days, ([Time 0:30:16](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ded69b10-ae21-4ecf-a0be-1ee02e4bc8b1))
    - **Note:** The future isn’t in commoditized knowledge but in asking differentiated questions. Being able to ask non commodity questions reveal power law answers and drive you forward. The best way to learn is to increase the learning cycles more opportunities to learn allows you to better develop your questioning and come out better off. Rapid iteration of learning leads to move and better learning in the long run. Get more reps and get more thoughtful about them.
- Lessons on Losing Your Instrument: Insights from Musicians
  Summary:
  One of the musicians, Philippe Quint, lost his. Most people would go, oh, I better be more careful with my instrument in that situation. He concluded they were publicity stunts. The question you should have said is, if they lost theirs, under what circumstances might I lose mine? That's not the lesson he drew.

  Speaker 1
  Oh, that's interesting. Most people would say, oh, I better be careful with my instrument. Oh, well, see, you're very smart. Well, you're OK, well, you're very wise. Most people would go, oh, I better be more careful with my instrument in that situation. But one of the musicians, Philippe Quint, lost his, and he knew about all the other musicians who had lost theirs. Do you know what he concluded, Shane? What? He concluded that none of them had lost their instruments. He concluded they were publicity stunts. He so could not imagine. Did somebody, yeah. There's no way yo, ma, because that would crush him. It would devastate him for years. That's crazy. But notice, but it's not so crazy. He himself dismissed it, because they didn't really lose their instruments. The question you should have said is, if they lost theirs, under what circumstances might I lose mine, that's not the lesson he drew. So I have to write in a chapter into the book that warns people of that. So this is something I'm gonna offer, Shane, because I know you're ([Time 0:50:39](https://share.snipd.com/snip/059b0b39-ff47-45d2-bf62-d296763c414d))
    - **Note:** Lessons and advice are warning more than anything else and we don’t take those warnings because we don’t think they apply to us. Our imagination limits our view of our abilities. All advice is a warning of what not to do and people dismiss it because they think they’re smarter. We should ask under what conditions should we watch out for this possible error in judgement. Make it real.
