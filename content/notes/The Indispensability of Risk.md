### Highlights

- As is obvious from the article’s title, the piece is mostly about the role of sacrifice. Ashley says, “Many positions cannot be won or saved without something of value being given away, from a lowly pawn all the way up to the mighty queen.” Intentionally losing a piece as part of one’s gameplan is the sacrifice that Ashley is referencing.
  • He describes some sacrifices as “shams,” (a term coined by chess master Rudolf Spielmann in his book *The Art of Sacrifice in Chess*) where “. . . one can easily see that the piece being given up will return concrete benefits that can be clearly calculated.”
  • Others are deemed “real” sacrifices, where “. . . giving away a piece offers gains that are neither immediate nor tangible. The return on investment might be controlling more space, creating an assailable weakness in the opponent’s position, or having more pieces in the critical sector of attack.”
  The analogy to investing begins to become clear. Buying a 10-year U.S. Treasury note is a modest or “sham” sacrifice. You give up the use of your money for ten years, but that’s only an opportunity cost, and accepting it brings the certainty of interest income. Most other investments involve real sacrifices, though, where the risk of loss is borne in pursuit of “gains that are neither immediate nor tangible.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwkdyx8cqczyxxhnsvtkxk9v))
    - **Note:** Tangible and intangible risks
- **It did not have to turn out that way.** It did because she was willing to stomach the key aspect of making real sacrifices: **the willingness to take risks****.** For a chess player, risk is as much intuited as it is calculated. Due to the inherent complexity of the game, it is virtually impossible to assess with certainty whether a risky move will pay off in the end. **It’s up to the player to decide if sufficient conditions have been met to take the chance on a risky move****. . .** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwkdym4hwnye4q5akyy20szy))

- c.” **Earning high returns – in absolute terms or relative to other investors in a market – requires that you bear meaningful risk – either the possibility of loss in the pursuit of absolute gain or the possibility of underperformance in the pursuit of outperformance. In each case, the two are inseparable.** As Ashley says, no risk, no reward. No pain, no gain.
  The risk inherent in not taking enough risk is very real. Individual investors who eschew risk may end up with a return that is insufficient to support their cost of living. And professional investors who take too little risk may fail to keep up with their clients’ expectations or their benchmarks.

    - **Note:** the risk of not taking risk
- **Investors must accept that success is likely to stem from making a large number of investments, all of which you make because you expect them to succeed, but some portion of which you know won’t.** You have to put it all out there. You have to take a shot. Not every effort will be rewarded with high returns, but hopefully enough will do so to produce success over the long term. That success will ultimately be a function of the ratio of winners to losers, and of the magnitude of the losses relative to the gains. But refusal to take risk in this process is unlikely to get you where you want to go.
  I’ll conclude with another good paragraph from Ashley:
  Taking a chance doesn’t mean there will be a successful outcome, nor does it require it. If the reasons are sound, the risk should be taken almost reflexively. The more often we trust our judgment, the more confidence we gain in our decision-making capacity. The courage to take risks becomes a worthwhile end in itself.
  The bottom line on the quest for superior investment returns is clear: **You shouldn’t expect to make money without bearing risk, but you shouldn’t expect to make money just for taking risk. You have to sacrifice certainty, but it has to be done skillfully and intelligently, and with emotion under control.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwke824tey9dgxf7fwxmeaxx))
