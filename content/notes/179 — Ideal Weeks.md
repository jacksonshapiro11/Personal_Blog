  Speaker 1
  This was the beginning of the end for me because I realized, I realized as I was thinking about this, that I really do not like manager time. And I found myself doing a lot of managing in the day job. And when I started thinking about what would it look like if I had more maker time, I got really excited.
  Speaker 2
  Yeah, I think that's true for a lot of people, but there are people who love manager time.
  Speaker 3
  Yes.
  Speaker 2
  It's really an imperfect comparison, but it's like somebody who has a job that spends a lot of time writing documents versus somebody who spends all day an email because their job is all about managing email. Those are very different demands on your time and that time has spent very differently, depending on what you're doing. And I think that relates. You want to audit how you work in building your perfect week so you can account for what you need. I always think of maker and manager. I have a third element to that consumer time he's been consuming in. And this really, the goal here is not to make a ideal week just for your work time. It's to make an ideal week to cover everything. And that's a part of it too. But I think the two big concerns really are maker and manager. And another part of it, I guess a third key component of it is what are your standing work and personal commitments?
