### Highlights

- First quant. Identities a clear edge that is obvious and simple and then is able to capture the edge. Many people don’t capture they don’t size their bets correctly. Academics like the perception of complication but Ed wanted to keep it simple. He came up with simple rules and heuristics to implement his strategies. Card counting had been complicated just holding every card in your head at once but Ed’s point system captures the edge without much complication. Economists didn’t like his practical approach to reasonable risk adjusted bets. He knew when he had enough didn’t get a mega fund and just hung it up focusing on family health and happiness. Chose independence. True success is exiting the rat race

    - **Note:** Transcending paradigms by exiting the rat race. He was the first quant and found a point of differentiation an edge and not only was he able to find this but he was able to monetize it. He chose simple systems instead of ornate academic methods. Practicality to get things done. Success isn’t about finding an edge but monetizing it.
      Capturing edge using simple heuristics
- Lifetime learner. Didn’t chase money after he was rich. Developed simple systems. Around health and happiness algorithms for life. Every hour you exercise is one less day in the hospital. Invested in relationship. Had fun in the adventure that is life. Following your curiosity is a better foundation than following whatever is making money right now.

    - **Note:** Ed was a lifelong learner who followed his interests because you can't compete vs people who make this their lives work. Time is the stuff life is made of an ed sought to maximize his with exercise and invest in the relationships that were important to him.
- Read big books as a kid because that’s all his family could afford his dad bought books and he shared them with him at 5. Avid reader loved adventure. Both his parents worked the graveyard shift so he was basically autonomous during WW2. Depression kid lived off 100 a month in college going to a church when the dorms didn’t feed people on Sunday’s.
    - **Tags:** #lifelong-learning, #reading-(avid), #resourcefulness, #hardworking
    - **Note:** Avid reader and learner who had to make the most of what he had when he was young which wasn’t much.
- Ed was a threat to the status quo. He ran and win student government against popular kids and wherever he saw corruption he aimed to up root it and sniff it out.
  He called out a professor who he saw as mediocre he hated mediocrity but learned when he did this he threatened the man’s self image and made an enemy. He realized it was better to no do this in the future. Avoided mediocre people when he could and finessed them when he couldn’t. So he comes up with a system. If you do this what do you want to happen if you do this what do you think will happen. Ask this when you’re on tilt.
  Need a good offense and good defense to make money and avoid losing money. The more money there is the more corruption there is.

    - **Note:** Ed just did what he wanted and was a threat to the status quo because he existed outside of it.
      He realized that attacking someones self concept was useless and net bad for the person who did it, so he didn't do it again. He came up with a system to stop himself and gain mindfulness in these situations
      Avoid mediocre people because you're the sum of your 5 closest friends.
      Making money and keeping money are different and require different offense and defense. Stop yourself when you’re on tilt.
- Pursued what was interesting to him thought for himself. Held non consensus views. Raising kids - give them all the education they wanted taught them to think for themselves and allowed them to follow their own calling. Important how they spent their time and who they spent it too.

- The best way to get rich is only play the games where you have an edge. I may not be right but I know your conventional wisdom is wrong so it’s just a matter of figuring out the right way ti approach the problem. Always had to prove to himself something was true couldn’t accept dogma.
  The difference between the people who do things and the people who just think about things is the people who do things pick up the phone and ask for help.
  What matters is what you do and how you do it and who you do it with.

- He decided to go to Vegas to test his system to prove it worked.
  Kelly criterion - best way to optimally bet. Manage risk and return.
  The more time he spent in Vegas the more he knew it was corrupt. The gaming board which he thought would protect him was paid off by the casino mobs and used to identify him to casinos a marker. The casinos try to drug him and kill him
  As he’s doing this he realizes he can choose between being a professional academic or professional gambler. It was all down to his character. Character is destiny.
  After almost getting killed by the mob he decides to refocus his efforts on beating the market. He spends a summer learning and reading everything possible. Like a whale gulping up seawater and filtering the nutritious krill. You can read a lot but most is filtering for a couple big ideas.

    - **Note:** Ed learned that vegas was an unfair game stacked against him. He thought he could beat the corruption with logic but it was so engrained he had no shot and almost died. Character is destiny and Ed decided to refocus on the market.
      Whale learning mental model, gulp up a ton of info and filter the nutritious bits. Works for massive creatures.
      Kelly Criterion on bet sizing for risk and return. optimal better.
      f = P/A - Q/B
      where:
      F is the fraction of the assets to apply to the security.
      P is the probability that the investment increases in value
      Q is the probability that the investment decreases in value ().
      A is the fraction that is lost in a negative outcome. If the security price falls 10%, then 
      B is the fraction that is gained in a positive outcome. If the security price rises 10%, then .
      Note that the Kelly criterion is valid only for known outcome probabilities, which is not the case with investments. Risk averse investors should not invest the full Kelly fraction.
      This formula can result in Kelly fractions higher than 1. In this case, it is theoretically advantageous to use leverage to purchase additional securities on margin.
- Gets to meet Warren buffet. His colleague who had read beat the market wanted to invest with him as he had been in warrens hedge fund which was winding down. Putting his work out there helped him reach a wide array of people. He saw warrens genius to evakurate companies that would compound above average over a long time horizon and bought a bunch of Berkshire stock. Warrens stock picking was different than his quant approach of finding securities mid priced relative to other securities from that company. If a warrant was over priced he’d short the warrant and buy the stock. Out of over 200 months Ed’s hedge fund lost money in 3 of them. Follow your passions and do it to the extreme.

    - **Note:** Ed invented quantatative hedge funds and warren was a genius. They both had their own skills that they brought to the table that made them a success. Putting your work out there to meet people. They both had unique differentiation
- Management by walking around would hire smart people out of college fresh minds. Would make hiring temporary for first 6 months. Paid well above the market rate which saved money from lower turn over.
  He decided he had to leave the petty squabbling of academia and do his hedge fund full time few academics followed him. People are like animals in cages with open doors with regard to jobs. Importance of self and being able to step out of what you’re in despite your little rut.

    - **Note:** Management by walking around and giving people a test or internship time before hiring. Paying more costs less because turnover is lower.
- The establishment cannot be attacked. Who is the greater criminal the guy who drives drunk or the guy who has 3 duis now what if the guy with duis only did it 3 times the other guy is his rival and in cahoots with the police. Finance is corrupt.
  Was the first LP in citadel who used his model to build a hedge fund.
  Success isn’t about making the most money it’s about having the best life. He left billions on the table but was happy to do so.
  Future of work highly profitable lean and automated operation.
  Those who only learn from their experience are destined to fail.
  The greatest jobs aren’t decreed or degreed they’re the creative expression of a continuous learner environment.
