  Speaker 1
  And so this poverty that his dad's really an inventor, we're going to talk a lot about this today, it's not enough to just be an inventor. You also have to be a skilled entrepreneur, which his dad wasn't, but his sons definitely were. And so, we're going to go right into Emanuel's life. It says, only his marriage brought him some measure of success. And it talks about the role that his wife and then the mother of Ludwig and Alfred, just how important she was to the family's success. Her patience, endurance, even her faith in her husband were sorely tested those first years of marriage as one after another of Emmanuel's dreams turned into nightmares. They moved from house to house on the outskirts of Stockholm needing but not being able to afford larger quarters for their growing family. Alfred was born just 10 months after his father had declared bankruptcy. Nobel's wife was the strong supportive pillar upon which she's going to build his business. This reminded me of when I read the the autobiography of the founder of Four Seasons, Isidore Sharp. There is a bunch of times where his wife is kind of adding commentary to the book about what it was like. Not Four Seasons now, but when four seasons was just an idea in her husband's brain. She talks about the fact that she saw him stressed, she saw him lying awake in the middle of the night, and she said something that was very, very, I think, profound. ([Time 0:09:36](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e3817dd0-f0d3-4726-abff-d08e9da9beb2))
    - **Note:** The Nobel family built an oil empire it was taken away by the Russian government after the revolution. Nobel started and was really struggling and his wife’s constant support was what gave him the strength to push through. Alfred’s wife needed to believe in him even when there was no reason to. There is no opportunity in Sweden poverty was considered part of life but he decided to leave Sweden and go to Russia in search of opportunity and built the oil industry but he literally got on a boat and left his family with no indication he could even be successful. He invented under sea mines and pitched it to the Russians and they bought in in 1840. While he’s gone his family is so poor the 7 year olds need to sell matches on thevstreet to get by. When he takes the family to Russia he gets the kids private tutors and allows them to get first hand experience working in the business every day. However he’s an inventor not an entrepreneur so he runs out of money because he doesn’t watch his costs. He constantly needed more contracts when it didn’t get renewed his company died. His kids then learned from his and built their empire
- Mastery Through Accountability
  Summary:
  Learning from mistakes necessitates behavioral changes.
  A significant insight lies in diversifying product offerings beyond dependency on military needs, exemplified by the introduction of a durable carriage wheel to address poor road conditions in Russia. This innovation established a market monopoly for the Nobel family, who maintained high standards that fostered brand prestige and employee pride.
  The Nobel family effectively controlled every facet of their business, from invention to manufacturing to sales, reinforcing their commitment to quality and innovation.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Learning from mistakes is changing your behavior, right? So he realizes we need a bunch of just consumer products. We can't just rely on the military. And so at the time you have carriage drivers. You know, these are horse-drawn carriages. The roads in Russia, shouldn't even be called roads. It was hilarious. They said that the coach, the roads were so bad in this area where they are, that the coach drivers would sit sideways with their legs hanging off the carriage. So they could jump off easily when they hit the inevitable giant hole in the road. So Ludwig makes the Nobel wheel, this carriage wheel that can actually withstand and not break. And the result was a monopoly on the market. This is also going to tie to this idea that the Nobel family had excessively high standards. And as a result, over time, they were able to build this incredible brand based on quality. The Nobel family name meant something there. In fact, later on, as they dominate the Russian oil industry, you know, they talked about their employees were proud. They wore the fact that they were Nobel lights that they worked for the Nobel family as a badge of honor, because I meant they were the best. Now I needed the reason I'm also telling you this is because one he's learning from his father but two this is like Ludwig's MO for everything. He wants to control everything from the invention to the manufacturing to the sales to everything. And so they invent the wheel they manufacture it then they set up all the sales organizations all over like all over Russia. ([Time 0:29:00](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2c4ae690-4218-41a0-a7a7-3780f72a6d40))
    - **Note:** The family learns learning is behavior change. Both brothers build businesses that are unique to themselves one is that of delegation the other is in a more competitive area so he has to do everything himself and be hands on. Focus on your unique differentiation. Also despite being broke they’re able to two old relationships and get loans from friends at favorite rates. Ludwig’s factories had much better conditions he didn’t employ kids lowered work day from 14 to 10 hours improved cleanliness and safety and created profit plans more incentived employees do better work it’s not a cost but investment. Built houses for workers and created school for workers. The family built very high quality products which helped them create monopolies very high standards. The family was constantly involved in each others businesses Alfred learned about nitroglycerin from his chemistry tutor his dad had for him and looked into it. This led to his invention of dynamite his success didn’t comes from his invention many people could do this but the business and monetization of his investment
- Seize the Right Opportunity
  Summary:
  Robert seizes a pivotal opportunity during his travels to Baku, where he encounters the potential of oil-rich land and a small refinery.
  Disregarding the original plan to purchase walnut wood, he decides to invest the entire sum of 25,000 rubles into the refinery instead, demonstrating that a single correct decision can outweigh numerous past failures. His bold choice underscores the unpredictable nature of business, where success hinges on finding favorable circumstances rather than ensuring every move is calculated in advance.

  And so Robert is working for Ludwig. Ludwig is making all these rifles and rifle stocks for the Russian military. He's like, hey, can you travel to this section over here because they're known to have phenomenal supplies of like walnut wood. And Ludwig gives Robert 25,000 rubles to buy up the whole stock of walnut wood. Robert is going to travel to this place called Baku. Baku is gonna be where they build their giant oil company. So we can call this section Robert's pivot. In all his travels, he had never seen anything like Baku and in all his dreams for personal enrichment, he had never seen greater potential. There were parcels of oil-rich land and bakou along with a small refinery. So he goes, he's like, I'm not buying your walnut wood. I want your refinery. His offer was the walnut money, all 25,000 rubles of it, a sudden decision taken without consultation with either Ludwig, after all it was Ludwig's money, or Alfred, the family expert In matters of finance and investment. When he returned to Petersburg, he would have to convince his brother that he had found a much better investment for the money than rifle stocks. And this is the remarkable thing about business. You only have to be right once. Up until this point, Robert had failed repeatedly. He just needed to wait until he found the right opportunity. So it says his two brothers looked upon this scheme with as much enthusiasm as they had viewed Robert's other projects. ([Time 0:34:25](https://share.snipd.com/snip/85060e7b-b5d5-45fe-a220-74816289f308))
    - **Note:** Robert the oldest brother had been unsuccessful throughout his life and went to Baku to get wood for his brothers rifle companies but sees the oil pivots and decides to buy that with the money without asking this was before oil had taken off and Robert had constantly failed in his ventures but it finally took one and he hit a home run. Only need to be right once. His brothers thought it was a stupid given his history of failure but he ride the wave and had second rate competition. He used his better knowledge to produce a much better product than all other 140 refiners the Hugh quality led to their competitive advantage the people in the industry couldn’t think for himself. They invented oil tankers to transport oil instead of moving the oil in barrels in order to send more. No one adopted this until they saw it working and implemented. His competitors were sheep. He built a fully integrated operation from pipelines to wicks he controlled the entire Russian oil industry. Drilling to retail and he built this in 10 years. He keeps trying to share ideas with competitors they never listen so he just does it. Ludwig was always incredibly optimistic he expected to struggle and needed to make his own decisions. Very high agency.
- Embrace Authenticity for Success
  Summary:
  Success does not rely on a universal formula; instead, it flourishes through the embrace of one's authentic self.
  The contrasting approaches of Ludwig and Alfred highlight that diverse personalities and methods can co-exist alongside immense achievement. While both men exemplified self-sufficiency and a strong work ethic that demanded order, their individual motivations and strategies differed markedly.
  Ludwig emphasized personal contribution and genius, advocating for a hands-on involvement in work, while Alfred prioritized delegation, choosing to focus on tasks that he could perform better than others.
  Their unique backgrounds, particularly the poverty of their youth, reinforced their motivation and instilled in them a profound understanding of the value of hard work.
  This illustrates that both perspective and purpose are integral to navigating one's path to success.

  Traveling his own road and he was certainly used to opposition. Okay, so now I want to go back to this idea I mentioned earlier that I think is really beneficial. The idea that the twin successes of Ludwig and Alfred are happening the exact same times. They're operating in different industries. They have different personalities. They have different ways of approaching their business. Yet, at the time, this is taking place. They're two of the most successful and richest entrepreneurs on the planet. And so this goes on for a few pages. I just want to compare and contrast them because I love this idea. Again, there's no formula. Just do whatever is authentic to you. Self-sufficient, independent with a devotion to work and a reliance on its routine, the Swedes demand a high level of order in that work. So they both share this, okay? A sense of purpose and perspective in their own rational civilization. For the Nobels, their boyhood of poverty strengthened that motivation. He who does not work need not eat, declared Ludwig. And so their father is going to weigh in on what he thought were the difference between his sons. Emmanuel believed that it was Alfred who demonstrated the greatest industry, but Ludwig the greatest genius. For Alfred, his rule was never to do myself what another could do better or at any rate as well. He wanted to delegate everything possible. ([Time 0:45:00](https://share.snipd.com/snip/dd0e2348-7129-46b9-8d6d-0d3dd4b783fe))
    - **Note:** The brothers were both sucesssful but Alfred was a master delegator he didn’t think one person could accomplish every little thing in entire company. Ludwig has charisma and dominated ever conversation he was in. Powerful man needed power was always at the forfront of business and spending time directly with his employees. Ludwig was an optimists loved people had 18 kids. Alfred was more cynical both pushed themselves at incredible pace to be great. Monopoly invites competition and Rockefeller tries to attack its crazy comptaruve but also the amount of oil is insane. Alfred creates the Nobel prize the family hates it even the king of Sweden tries to overturn the will but his son stays steadfast and doesn’t give in because it was the wrong moral thing to do. Fought his family then the king. things can change so fast in three days the factor went from operational to invaded by revolutionary and killing people in the backyard. Emmanuel had to escape dressed as a peasant. Things can change so fast.
- History's Swift Change Must Not Be Underestimated
  Summary:
  Historical narratives reveal the rapid shifts in societal structures and power dynamics, emphasizing that stability is often an illusion.
  Families that once held wealth and influence can find themselves in peril. The experiences of individuals during revolutions serve as stark reminders that assumptions about the permanence of the present can lead to grave misjudgments.
  The Bolshevik Revolution illustrated this alarming truth; once secure and prosperous families lost everything as chaos reigned.
  Many believed the upheaval was temporary, a notion ultimately proven dramatically wrong.
  Those who failed to heed the signs of an irreversible transformation faced dire consequences. Even amidst such upheaval, the resilience of individuals like Emmanuel, who chose to embrace optimism rather than succumb to bitterness, underscores the powerful human spirit in times of crisis. History is a testament to the unpredictable and often violent nature of change, where the not-so-distant past can slip away in an instant, reinforcing the imperative to remain vigilant and adaptable to the signs of change.

  English, worked in a shoe factory, and at a butcher shop understood the danger that his family was in when Castro took over and moved to a country where he didn't know anybody and didn't Speak the language. And so growing up with these stories that you hear over and over again, this is something I talked to Sam Zell about when I had lunch with him too, because his family escaped the Holocaust. They got out. I think they were on the last train in Poland. As somebody that's grown up in America, I think you can have the assumption that the way things are now is the way things will be forever. History just shows how fast things can change. Emmanuel is the third generation of one of the wealthiest and most respected families in Russia, and he escapes hidden as a peasant. People come into the factories and murder their employees. And so now we have an account of what it was like to experience the Bolshevik Revolution, not knowing what was going on. And so there's an executive in the Nobel company that kept a diary. And it goes remarkable how fast things change. The diary lasts for less than two weeks. And I just want to pull out a couple lines that are spread across several days there. They are in order. So it starts Thursday. Streetcars stop running. Strikes in several factories. The police clear the streets of demonstrators shouting bread. Friday, strikes are spreading, confrontations between police and the people. Streets cleared and closed off from crowds. Saturday, police often disguised as soldiers and COSACs hold the crowd in check, dead and wounded lying on the streets. Sunday, stores have boarded up their windows. The police are shooting. Cossacks are using whips. In the evening, a lot of shooting. Drivers who are carting off the corpses talk about hundreds. Monday. All offices and workshops are closed. We let anyone go home who wants to. An employee's nephew was killed by a stray bullet. Hit him right in the forehead as he was standing in a window watching the activities on the street. Tuesday, as we were walking to the office we came under fire shooting at us from both sides of the street. In the evening, we do not use any rooms facing the street. And this is why. Between 9 and 10 at night I opened the door to my study just slightly, lighting the front window for a second. Machine gun fire sprayed the entire facade of the building. Wednesday, more house searches. The person who lives on the floor below us is arrested and taken away." And it was remarkable even after all that he ends the journal. The worst is probably over. The anarchy in Petersburg soon spread to other cities. The collapse of the imperial government in the abdication of the Tsar. The wives and children of Nobel's Swedish employees moved back to the safe shores of their neutral country. Lenin and his Bolsheviks seized power. They wasted no time showing the nation the meaning of totalitarian revolution. All newspapers but their own were suppressed. Editors were imprisoned, and the only printed or spoken word permitted was that of the Bolsheviks. Their avalanche of decrees covered every phase of economic, political, spiritual, and intellectual life. The workers and soldiers demanded great sums of money from the industrialists. Nobel factories succumbed to the chaos and closed down. Transport was nationalized. Factories were nationalized. Owners and managers dismissed. Bank deposits seized. Prices skyrocketed. Czar and his family were murdered the petroleum industry was Nationalized this is the craziest sentence in the book a former insane asylum inmate was named Minister of War and promptly Proposed the election of a donkey to the council to represent oppressed animals an illiterate sailor was placed in charge of the schools and a well-known pimp was given control of public Welfare. Discipline and routine were replaced by endless series of meetings, decrees, and denunciations. None of the Nobel Chiefs really believed that the danger was more than a passing phenomenon and that the Bolsheviks could continue very long in power. This idea that this won't last, things will go back to normal, is a very common, reoccurring belief in history around both wars and revolution. These are not stupid people, and yet they couldn't have been more incorrect. And they realized this is when they have to get out, or they're going to be killed. The last nobles had departed after three quarters of a century. The Swedish saga of a family in Russia came to a bitter end. All of their assets are seized, all their factories. Emmanuel, the son of Ludwig, goes back to Sweden. And this goes back to even his grandfather and his father, this relentless optimism that they had in their blood. Emmanuel had found great pleasure in life, even in exile. He refused to be consumed by anger and bitterness. His few remaining years were not going to be wasted, worrying or falling victim to a paralyzing pestilence of hate and frustration. In Baku, all visual proof of the Nobel name was removed. The pre-Soviet slate wiped clean, wrenched from a place in history, reduced to the category of non-person. Emmanuel the father, Ludwig, Robert and Emmanuel the grandson and all those nobles who struggled and strained to build and create disappeared into the mist. Glory, power and honor, obliterated by those who seized what they had created, their acts long forgotten by those secure from such a miserable fate." stories that I couldn't get to. I could do a podcast on, you know, entire chapters, multiple podcasts, because there's just so much detail in this book.

    - **Note:** What a revolution looks like and how fast it can all change.
