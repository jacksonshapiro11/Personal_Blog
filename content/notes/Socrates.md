    - **Note:** Socrates was aware that people were largely ignorant of the world but unwilling to admit it. There is no issue with being ignorant but bad to be ignorant of our ignorance.
      He wanted to teach people how to think at a systems level not what to think.
      Believed accepted wisdom in a field was usually wrong and the truth exists but is rarely clear and obvious. His suspicion of the truth is the Jeff bezos assuming everything is wrong until you prove it for yourself
- Hostile to the idea there was a right answer. Denial of independent thought is mandating there is one right answer. – grey thinking there is no right answer just a mosaic of probabilities
  Vigor or mind always thinking and valued reflective thought - a life without examination is not a life worth living. He believed retaliation was wrong.
  Socrates was killed because he engaged in skeptical thinking. Athens was a vengeful place with vendettas and jealousy notoriously volatile hated pretentiousness like high school to the max a group reveled and they voted Democratically to kill all the men and boys and sell the women into slavery. He loved Athens and would never leave. He accepted the trail and never had a defense or fight – the perils of mob rule and archaic systems.
