  Key takeaways:
  - Having a period of stillness and a blank slate can be challenging for ambitious individuals, but it allows for openness and the potential to do anything
  - Summiting Mount Everest was an ultimate adventure and led to the development of a unique company value to think like a mountaineer
  - The mindset of a mountaineer involves prioritizing safety and being prepared for potential challenges or changes
  - Having a plan A is important, but it's also crucial to consider alternative possibilities and potential risks

  Speaker 1
  Left to go climb Mount Everest. And you know, I sort of had this like, you know, self discovery expedition of climbing to the highest point in the world, because, you know, at the time, I like didn't, I didn't have a plan, right? I didn't have a plan on what I was going to do next. And that was like a, what a four month. It was about two months, two months experience, two months in Nepal for other aspiring entrepreneurs that are kind of out there listening. I do think that there's something very unique and special about the blank slate and just like the, the stillness of, of having nothing there. It can be particularly challenging for very ambitious people, right? Because it's like before I left high school, I knew exactly where I was going to college. Before, you know, the fall of my senior year, I knew exactly what job I had already accepted. Like when I left that first job and went to grad school, I knew that before I left the job, you know, it was kind of like, I always had the next thing planned before I had left the previous thing, having that stillness and that, that, that void of like, I could do anything. What should I do? And just really having that, that openness to, you know, being open minded to, you know, honestly doing anything was really, really important to me.
  Speaker 2
  And you did summit, right?
  Speaker 1
  I did summit. Yes. It's crazy. Yeah. Yeah. It was the ultimate adventure. So much fun. A lot of really cool memories came out of it. And actually one of our core company values came out of this whole expedition as well. So one of our very, very unique company values is actually to think like a mountaineer. And we're not expecting everyone to climb Mount Everest. We're not expecting everyone to be a mountaineer. But we want them to channel the mindset of a mountaineer. One of the ideas when you're climbing a mountain is that one, getting up is optional, getting down is mandatory. So you have to have a safety oriented mindset, which means you have to be thinking about what could go wrong. You know, you're going to have a plan A that's like, if everything goes to plan, you know, we're going to follow this route, we're going to climb this path and we're going to do this crux and then we're going to get to the top and then we're going to come down this way. But the weather could change. The route could change. An avalanche could happen. ([TimeÂ 0:55:35](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c26b5090-6d87-4fe3-bdce-558e28599d5b))
    - **Note:** The importance of a blank slate.
