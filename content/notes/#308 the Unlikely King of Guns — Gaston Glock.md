### Highlights

- "Glock, The Rise of America's Gun" Book Review
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  That was an excerpt from the book that I'm going to talk to you about today which is Glock, the rise of America's gun and is written by Paul Barrett. I was not expecting to do this book this week. This book wasn't even on my radar until like a week or two ago. I saw somebody speaking about reading the book online and what they said made me interested in ordering the book. He says what struck me is how his inexperience was a great advantage. He didn't assume anything about how to design a handgun because he never designed one before. Consequently, he of course designed the best one ever. He didn't know what was out of bounds. The idea of not knowing what's out of bounds, not knowing what you don't know, it sounds like to a normal person like a liability. But as we've seen many of these books that you and I go over together, for entrepreneurs, especially going attacking an initially they never worked in before, it winds up becoming an advantage. That'll make a lot more sense as we go through the book. That intro occurs about 15 years after Glock invents and starts selling his handgun. This story is wild because not only does he have people stealing from him, his financial advisor actually hired the guy to kill Glock. But what's crazy is over the course of the story, Glock has so many of his top lieutenants and top executives steal from him, which I'll get to in a bit. I want to start at the beginning because it doesn't make any sense. This guy was 50 years old. He was managing a car radiator factory outside of Vienna. ([Time 0:05:02](https://share.snipd.com/snip/70612a68-d146-4647-83f0-63fbea08e679))
    - **Note:** Glock was an outsider who at 50 had never made or owned a gun and ended up making the best gun ever. His business partners and financial advisers tried to steal from him often. He had 30 years on manufacturing experience but was ambitious. When he hears the Austrian army wanted a new gun. He bid on the contract having no experience then spent a lot of time studying gun patents and buying and taking apart guns to see how they worked. He does professional research asking the head of procurement in the army for specs and meeting with them. He decided to optimize for fewest moving parts to keep the system simple. In 2 years he went from 0 to products. Moved very fast. Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication Glock built everything from the bottom up reinventing what a factory would look like from first principles. Differentiation for difference sake as well on his construction to make his Glock notable. He ends up being in the right place at the right time and is law enforcement is looking for new firearms to combat the drug war and Glock is there. Glock worked with the Austrian government for years making great knives and when his gun came around he had engendered goodwill. Played the game in front of him ro the best of his abilities.
- The Perfection of Glock: High Quality and Generous Profits
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Glock demanded high quality. The motto of the company is perfection. Glock perfection to this day. It's like all along the walls and everything. But this was very interesting. This is the three star general in the Austrian army and he's describing Glock at the early days of building his company. So Glock is still alive today. He's like 93. I think he's like 52 where we are in the book. He says there's this interesting guy. He never in his life designed a field knife and he delivered the best quality samples among all the industry participating. And all those guys have been in the knife industry for hundreds of years. Then this interesting guy came back and sold a newly designed handgun to the Ministry of Defense quality will always bring you more money. Now what happens if you're able to make high quality in the simplest way? You have a company that's going to essentially just created a money printing machine. And this paragraph is really the benefit of a product with fewer moving parts and a company with fewer moving parts. They settled on a commercial wholesale price of $360 and a recommended retail price of $560. These levels undercut comparable American and European brands. Yet they generated generous profits. Glock's gross margins exceeded 65%. ([Time 0:24:38](https://share.snipd.com/snip/447d43e4-2d12-4019-8d49-dc5ae4bd9761))
    - **Note:** Glock met a man in the us who would help with distribution. This man saw the Glock in a magazine and thought it would make a great pistol so he helmet Glock to test it. The gun got into the hands of law enforcement and while it looked funny the quality was very high. Glock was obsessed with quality. From making his knives to these guns quality was his North Star which made him and his products stand out. He also undercut competition on price with 60% margins when competition had 5-20%. His very unusual design got him free media attention and customer attention. His cost structure was so low he only needed to sell 80k fir the year to break even in his first trade show he sold 20k. The attention and commotion was free advertising. That’s how most people heard of it. He wanted to get it in low enforcements hands because then he knew the people would follow.
- Glock's Unusual Distribution and Low Manufacturing Costs Revolutionize Law Enforcement Market
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  The other existing gun manufacturers would make you come to them. They took the training program on the road. You had to go to Smith and Wesson Academy in Massachusetts if you were going to use this, if you were going to use the Smith and Wesson. If your agency was going to adopt the Glock, we would send training your way. Again, this goes back to this more unusual forms of distribution. Why? Many times, instructors from neighboring agencies attended these sessions out of curiosity. Glock would then sponsor an open house seminar for all federal, state, and municipal trainers in a given region. This was just a brilliant way to sell this gun. And then what happens next could have been predicted by Andrew Carnegie when he says, about the prices, scoop the market, watch the costs, and the profits will take care of themselves. The deals worked financially because of the company's startlingly low manufacturing costs, which Glock was able to push down even further to less than $100 a unit as its production volume grew. Targeting the lucrative professional law enforcement market was a great idea, but it was not a new idea all the way back on episode 147. You and I have seen this idea before. Glock is literally running Sam Colt's exact playbook. He was just doing it 100 years earlier. Glock was not the first firearm designer to promote a handgun to the Americans in uniform as a means of developing a lucrative market. The first was Sam Colt. ([Time 0:31:36](https://share.snipd.com/snip/83220115-f01b-4371-8127-a137791fb620))
    - **Note:** Glock ran Sam colts marketing playbook. Getting the gun into law enforcement hands as marketing. Glock also sent instructors for free to help customers understand the machine better. These freebies helped them differentiate their offering when other manufacturers made people come to them. He made it very easy and gave free perks to customers this gave him a big edge. His cost structure was so low it enabled a lot of flexibility in the company as well. They had focus in one product instead of complicating things with many product lines. Got his gun into law enforcement hands and movies like die hard. They couldn’t make guns fast enough to meet demand.
- From Radiator Manager to Billion-Dollar Industrialist: The Unconventional Rise of Gaston Glock
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  He evolved from a provincial manager of a radiator factory to a world traveling industrialist. That is one of the craziest sentences in the entire book because it is true. He evolved from a provincial manager of a radiator factory to a world traveling industrialist. He owns all of the company. This company is worth billions of dollars. Glock built a cash machine with margins in the neighborhood of 70%. The slogan, Glock perfection was not puffery to Gaston Glock. He believed it. His organization projected coolness, certainty and arrogance. The founder was capable of charm and at other times he struck people as distant and condescending. He expressed disdain for Glock's American employees based on nothing more than their nationality. He hires a bunch of people to also speak German and that happen to work in America and they like to talk in German and they talk about how stupid Americans are. This is what a bizarre guy. He had an unforgiving management style. When one day, which one day he summarized, every morning you have to slap everyone on the head just in case they did something wrong. Then he does just some unwise things. He goes around. Their American headquarters is right outside of Atlanta. He would meet women. He's married the whole time. ([Time 0:36:18](https://share.snipd.com/snip/22d0c35d-fdb9-4540-9284-0a86339793ee))
    - **Note:** He was a regional manager for a radiator factory to the biggest gun manufacturer in the world. All after he was 50. He was a difficult man even a tyrant. He hates the American employees and divorced his wife spent time with very young women. He was feared by employees but his company was incredibly successful. Glock had a big ego and Carl Walter the man who brought Glock to America was fired because Glock didn’t like he was accepting awards and getting rich. His company was so strong that despite people trying to kill him and embezzle from him because they hated him the company went right on performing. Built a business that was so good it could survive anything.
