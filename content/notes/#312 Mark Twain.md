- Lighting Out for the Territory: Mark Twain's Journey West
  Summary:
  The book 'Lighting Out for the Territory' explores Samuel Clemens becoming Mark Twain and heading West, emphasizing the significance of the environment and era one grows up in.
  Mark Twain's upbringing in Missouri along the Mississippi River instilled in him the notion of 'lighting out for the territory,' witnessing travelers reinventing themselves in the legendary West. This theme reflects the timeless human desire for self-reinvention and new beginnings.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  That is an excerpt from the book I'm going to talk to you about today, which is lighting out for the territory, how Samuel Clemens headed West and became Mark Twain and is written by Roy Morris Jr. I want to tell you how I stumbled upon this book. A few months ago, I'm traveling with my wife down the coast of California where somewhere between Santa Barbara and Los Angeles, and I stumbled into this little coffee shop across the Street from the coffee shop, I saw it's a used bookstore. So of course, I had to go over there. It was a tiny one room used bookstore that only sold books for cash. And it is, I was looking through their biography section, of course, and that is where I found this book. And they somehow agreed to sell to me for the sticker price of $2. I want to jump right into the introduction because I think the author does a fantastic job of talking about the importance of the place and time in which we grow up. And in Mark Twain's case, he's growing up in Missouri on the western bank of the Mississippi River. And it says he knew all about the concept of lighting out for the territory. As a young boy, he regularly watched the steamboats who were offloading travel-worn passengers whose dreams involved making a new start of things in the West that already legendary Region where man with a past could successfully reinvent himself. That last sentence is incredible. And it is also a reoccurring theme in human nature. ([Time 0:04:42](https://share.snipd.com/snip/34d6bd95-35bc-4aa1-bf89-b168a9963f21))
    - **Note:** Twain left Missouri as Sam Clemons and went west all the way to Hawaii going from a failed steamboat captain to transcendent writer. The west was where a man with a past could reinvent himself. Twain was a power law person where his literary impact far surpassed what could be expected from 1 person. He roamed the plains looking for jobs with one foot out the door when he got conscripted to fight for both sides in the civil war he went west. Twain thought he would be a steamboat captain but he failed at many things and stumbled from one failure to the next trying different locations and jobs along the way then found his life’s work writing you can’t connect the dots looking forwards you’re kinda moving from thing to thing and only in hindsight is your life clear but that was never your plan. He was a steamboat pilot but that was shutdown when the war came. He loved the freedom of the river and was a person who needed this freedom in his life. But the civil war made him go out for something else.
- The Perils and Hardships of Mark Twain's Journey West
  Summary:
  Mark Twain faced numerous life-threatening risks during his journey west, including hostile Indians, various illnesses, natural disasters, accidents, and wild animal attacks.
  The author vividly depicts the challenging conditions such as extreme heat, mud, dust, and labor that travelers like Twain had to endure. Despite the dangers, the rallying cry 'go west young man' inspired generations to seek opportunity and a better life in the west.
  Twain encountered a diverse array of characters and was intrigued by new technologies like the Pony Express, a groundbreaking mail service aimed at meeting the national need for faster coast-to-coast delivery.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  There's several ways that Mark Twain could have died on this trip and the author does a fantastic job of listing those. So at this point, you have to worry about hostile Indians, callerer, dysentery, tuberculosis, smallpox, measles, mumps, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, scurvy, accidental drownings, Accidental shootings, wagon mishaps, falls, lightning strikes, tornadoes, whirlwinds, blizzards, quicksand, wild animal attacks, snake bites, starvation, exhaustion, exposure, And sometimes sheer melancholy. To enjoy such a trip, a man must be able to endure heat like a salamander, mud and water like a muskrat, dust like a toad, and labor like a jackass. It is a hardship without glory to be sick without a home, to die and be buried like a dog. And the crazy thing about all that, right, is that go west young man, that line was a rallying cry for an entire generation, maybe two generations of young men to head west risk all of this For opportunity and a better life. And so Twain is going to meet all kinds of interesting and crazy characters over the next six years as they're in the stagecoach heading west. One thing that he wanted to see was this new technology of their day, this new service. It's called the Pony Express. So the Pony Express was actually like a genius invention of like a wildly entrepreneur. The Pony Express was intended to answer the national demand for swifter, more dependable coast to coast mail service.

    - **Note:** Twain wanted to sell cocaine which was a new plant at the time on his trip he met a steamboat pilot who took him as a mentor and taught him the ropes of the leading technology of the day he loved how you could read rivers like books and this was a well paying job as well. He thought he would do this forever until he gets drafted into the war. It took him 2 years to learn the ropes and the job was very hard but he decided to trek out west risking attack from wildlife Indians disentary among other things. But the hope of a new life drove many Americans west at this time despite the massive risk in search of a new life. Twain gets to Carson city and the first day he’s in the capital there is a windstorm and a gun fight. The pony express is literally people dashing 100 miles a day at breakneck speeds by horse sometimes with arrows in their bodies still. Proof of how wild the Wild West was even meets Brigham young.
- The Trouble with Expecting Oil on the Surface
  Summary:
  The insight highlighted is the metaphorical meaning of expecting to find oil on the surface, symbolizing how people often seek quick and easy gains without delving deep into hard work.
  It reflects the tendency to follow trends and engage in speculative activities rather than putting in the effort for genuine work. The speaker emphasizes the importance of digging deep, both metaphorically in life and literally in mining, to uncover the true value and success, instead of just engaging in superficial activities that lead to bubbles and bursts.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So when I got to this section, there's this excellent book that I covered a long time ago. I should reread it. It's called the big rich. It is about the second oil boom in Texas history. It is episode 149. The book is amazing, but there's a line in the book that I've never forgotten. I think it's a metaphor for for life, not just for oil. And it says the trouble with this business is that everybody expects to find oil on the surface. If it was up near the top, it wouldn't be any trick to it. You've got to drill deep for oil. That is a very similar thought behind the line in this book. This is the purest veins were usually the deepest. And so one problem with human nature is that we all get caught up in what everybody else is doing. And that's why there's these bubbles and bursts over and over again. And so the same thing's happening here. They're like, nobody wants to actually dig and do the actual mining. What we want to do is we want to trade paper. We want to buy shares in largely non-existent mines. And so the buying and shares of buying and selling this paper, these shares in these mines, the entire camp, the entire region that that Twain is in is doing engaging the same practice. And so Twain's like, oh, that's genius. I can make a ton of money. I don't have to do any work. He says, the trick is not to mine the silver ourselves by the sweat of our own brows and the labor of our hands, but to sell the ledges, the paper to the dull slaves, a toil and let them do the Mining. And here's the problem with that. Twain is taking his the money he saved up through his own labor and then speculating. What do you think is going to happen? ([Time 0:27:55](https://share.snipd.com/snip/065dddd8-34f9-47ff-96df-49fb45771f32))
    - **Note:** There was a big mining book and everyone wanted to get rich quick without working which didn’t work out for most. Basically speculating on start ups instead of doing the work. Human nature get rich quick instead of doing the work. Often the purest mine comes from the deepest vein. You need to dig really deep to get the requisite rewards you cant just make money mining the surface. People are lazy and would rather trade paper than do work. A market evolves in this area to do this. Speculation is human nature. He is going from failure to failure and gets really depressed and jaded about his future. He’s kinda giving up on life from his deep depression and at his darkest hour is when mark Twain started to be formed. He had been writing humorusly to a newspaper for fun and they decided to give him a staff writer position out of the blue for $25 where he can travel around and report. Twain luckily ended up in the best newspaper between St. Louis and San Fran with great founders who hired a players. Here he learned first get the facts then distort them how you want.
- The Young Founders and Early Influences on Mark Twain's Fiction Writing
  Summary:
  Young founders, including a 23-year-old editor and a 21-year-old printing form, guided Mark Twain in his early career.
  They emphasized the importance of getting the facts first before distorting them, a principle Twain applied in his fiction writing. Twain, known for not being a hard worker, made profits by doing less work than he was paid for.
  Another founder advised Twain to prioritize certainty in reporting, influencing Twain's approach to fiction writing a decade later.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Under the energetic leadership of the new owners, you have the 23 year old editor and then the 21 year old printing form. And now that's pretty crazy because Twain is older than his bosses. These young founders are also gifted at finding other talented people. And that's important because his what's going to be Twain's closest friend at work is this guy that goes by the pen name Dan DeQuill. The first bit of advice that he gives Twain, Twain is going to carry for the rest of his career. And it was wise and succinct. And this is what he says, get the facts first, then you can distort them as much as you like. And so if you go and study a lot of Twain's fiction, it's rooted in actual factual events that then he then distorts and exaggerates, right? It says Twain would never be a particularly hard worker. He laid it boasted. He later boasted that he made a 50% profit on his work for the enterprise because he was being paid $6 a day and only doing $3 a day worth of work. And so one of the founders of the newspapers also going to give Twain a good piece of advice that Twain's going to apply to his fiction writing about a decade later. And so he's saying, listen, when you're writing for this newspaper, we don't say things like, it is reported or it is rumored or we understand. Instead, we get the facts and then we speak out and say it is so and so. And this is the reason otherwise people will not pick confidence in your news. Unassailable certainty is the thing that gives a newspaper the firmest and most valuable reputation. ([Time 0:32:02](https://share.snipd.com/snip/af091577-fa3c-49fe-adc8-9a623c9e642e))
    - **Note:** Newspapers need to get and report the facts they need unassailable certainty. People are attracted to confidence and deterred from nuance. Mark learnwd to trust his instincts on the river which helped him his entire life. Twain learned from
      Artemis ward who was the best humorist of the time. Ward read twains work and wanted to meet him. Importance of putting your work out there. He learned it was less what you said and more how you said it. Ward emplored him to go back east to write for the best publications out East. Do you profession at the highest level don’t write for a middle of the road paper but the best one possible. He went to SF became a beat writer and hated the monotony every day. He was willing to quit or get fired out of principal because he loved freedom and autonomy but this lead to the darkest period in his life. He is broke and literally has a gun to his head resolving to mill himself as nothing will come out of his life. He put down the gun and picked up the pen. He was in debt but couldn’t kill himself. Opportunity is a strange beast it finds you when you’re not looking. Twain reaches out to Artemis who agrees to publish something of Twain’s in the equivalent of the New Yorker but Twain can’t write the thing. As he is about to write his apology and give up it strikes him like lightning and catalyzes his first viral hit that launched his career.
- The Viral Hit that Led to Success
  Key takeaways:
  - The author immediately wrote the tale after being inspired by a strange event.
  - Cormac McCarthy and Mark Twain also experience a similar process of spontaneous writing.
  - The story unexpectedly became a viral hit and gained national attention.
  - The author did not initially realize the significance of the story and thought it was just a means of making a living.
  - The success of this story opened up new opportunities for the author in the literary world.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I immediately got up and wrote out the tale. If it hadn't been for the little fellows appropriation in a in the strange fashion, I would have never written about him. If you ever hear Cormac McCarthy talk about the way he writes, says it just comes out of him. It's very similar to what Mark train saying is like I tried to try to fought against it didn't come. I'm laying there about to give up and then it just comes out of me and I sit down and I write it out. The importance of this story cannot be understated. It is his first viral hit is going to sweep across all the newspapers and all the magazines all throughout the country, which is going to lead him to his next big break when he's in Hawaii, which I'll get there in a second. What's fascinating about this is the viral nature of this story caught him by surprise. He didn't even think it was that good. The only one not amused by the story it seemed was the author himself to think that after writing many articles, a man might be excused for thinking that were tolerably good. So saying I thought I wrote a bunch of good stuff in the past. Those New York people should single out a villainous backwards sketch to compliment me on. So he's like, this was just something that I was trying to make to write just to make a living to just survive. Didn't even take it that seriously. And yet it is one in which all the country is praising me for. And it is the first opportunity that opens up every single opportunity after listen to this grudgingly and gradually train accepted his fate. He thought he had a call to literature of a low low order. That's what they called it at the time. ([Time 0:43:38](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e1cdec18-1f21-4bdc-809c-3ebc610d8b78))
    - **Note:** He was shocked by his success and realized this would likely be how he spends the rest of his life. He thought all his writing was good. This kicked off his entire career. He decides he doesn’t want to write this low humor and instead make literature as everyone knows his name. He went to Hawaii and ended up finding a mentor and stayed much longer. Twain’s relationship in Hawaii gets him the scoop on an amazing shipwreck story that garners him national attention. Twains marketing for this ship wreck was a master stroke in drawing attention and spoke to his skills well. The country was hungry for knowledge and needed cross country lecturers. Building businesses around things that don’t change. This talking with others and learning is a key human trait. You can always build for this Jeff realized people would always want fast delivery and cheap prices so he built his career around this. So you can invest a lot to the long term knowing it won’t change.
- Mark Twain's stage antics and response to criticism
  Summary:
  Mark Twain, known for his extreme stage fright, would strategically seed the audience with friends to ensure his punchlines landed well.
  After his shows, he would join the audience in getting drunk, garnering attention and success. Despite facing criticism, Twain humorously responded by acknowledging everyone's right to their opinion, adding a witty remark about enjoying the sound of money earned from his shows.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And so another thing that he does, he's so nervous. He has complete like stage fright. He's completely terrified of what he's about to do is he seeds the audience. So who Cohen like he has a bunch of friends. I think he's got like, I don't know, like maybe eight or 10 different friends sitting all over the theater and he even knows where they are. So if he wants to deliver like make sure that like the punch line hits or they laugh, he'll like look in the direction. If they makes eye contact, that means to laugh. Once one or two people laugh, usually in an audience, other people kind of pick it up as well. And so he seeded the audience. The second thing that was hilarious, right, is now he's on tour is that Twain would finish his show and then he go out with the audience and get absolutely hammered. He'd go out and get drunk after the show was over with people in the audience. And so as he keeps traveling around doing more shows, more newspapers pick it up, more magazines talk, start talking about it. He gets he started getting a lot of attention for his shows. It becomes very very successful. Like I said, something he does for the rest of his life. But then of course, as the growth of popularity of anything, he starts getting a lot of critics. Twain's response to criticism is hilarious. He says everybody has a right to his opinion, even if he is an ass. They have the consolation of abusing me and I have the consolation of slapping my pocket and hearing the money jiggle. So before you and I end this conversation, let's go. ([Time 0:53:10](https://share.snipd.com/snip/01e1a6fa-3ed1-4961-875a-e5dd51cabcca))
    - **Note:** Twains approach to critics was to say they can complain but I’m rich. He didn’t mind them and entitled people to their opinions. He went traveling around given lectures would plant people in the audience to laugh and would go out drinking after with his fans. Has great mentors and learns a ton and constantly fails it gets dark but he pivots and becomes successful. In his international tour he met the love of his life and catalyzed his novel writing.

  Speaker 1
  But then of course, as the growth of popularity of anything, he starts getting a lot of critics. Twain's response to criticism is hilarious. He says everybody has a right to his opinion, even if he is an ass. They have the consolation of abusing me and I have the consolation of slapping my pocket and hearing the money jiggle. So before you and I end this conversation, let's go. Let's look back at what is taking place, right? Fine. He thinks he's going to be a cocaine dealer. He travels down, stone goes upon the best job he thought he'd have forever. The Mississippi River Boat Steamboat pilot. Then something completely out of his control, the Civil War comes, causes him to flee go out west and he has all these series of adventures. Turns from Samuel Clemens into Mark Twain meets a bunch of people along the way that give him fantastic advice and change of trajectory of his life. Experience is unbelievably high and then at the very bottom where he wants to, he has a gun to his head, finds the best opportunity of his life, writes what he thinks is just a silly story. That story goes viral. That story creates all these other fans and people that love Twain and want to help him. He turns that into a trip to Hawaii, meets another one of his fans who happens to be very influential, who leads into the greatest journalistic scoop he has of all time. That leads him to his lecture career, which is a great career, which further enhances his public profile, which leads him to this 23 week trip in Europe, which is in turn going to lead to the source material for his first great publishing success in book form, which then in turn changes his life forever. Once again, Twain's restless nature served him well. The subsequent 23 weeks he spent touring the Old World gave him both the inspiration and the raw material for the book The Innocence Abroad, his first great publishing success and the biggest selling book in the United States in the last 17 years. Twain also found a girl, or rather he found the girl's brother, and then he found the girl. Her name was Olivia Luis Langdon, and she was to be the love of his life. Had he not gone on that voyage, his career most likely would have mirrored that of his recently deceased drinking companion Ward, a one man show lived out in smoky lecture halls, CD hotel rooms, and late night bars. Instead, much to the wonderment of his western friends, Mark Twain set out rehabilitating himself in the single minded interests of winning the girl. Twain told his friend that she was the most perfect gem of women kind that I ever saw in my life, and I will stand by that remark until I die. Against all odds, he would prove as good as his word. The unlikely marriage of the hard-knock humorous from Backwoods, Missouri, and the heiress from Upstate New York worked surprisingly well. Twain showed the previously sheltered Livy the world. She in turn, civilized him. For the next 34 years, in good times and bad, the couple presented a unified front, a model marriage blessed with three spirited daughters and innumerable cats. The contented author produced the remarkable stream of novels, short stories, essays, and travel pieces that today stands as one of the great bodies of work in English literature. The first book he completed after his marriage was roughing it, a sunny and expansive account of his cross-country stagecoach trip with his brother a decade earlier and his adventures in the raw and wild West. What an incredible ending to the story and an illustration in one of Mark Twain's long-held beliefs that you can live multiple lives, that you can constantly. No matter what, you can constantly reinvent yourself. ([Time 0:54:06](https://share.snipd.com/snip/608a10e5-f2f5-4864-a587-6675f6d0a4e7))
