### Highlights

- Build a systematic growth engine and compelling story. You don’t want to hire people you want them to want to join you. Missionaries vs mercenaries. Hire people to grow and deploy capital aggressively don’t be passive. Hiring and hiring well is vital. You’re running a company as a CEO. Good hiring starts with not a good recruiting firm but a good recruiter who understands your company deeply can disqualify people easily and knows what you need. 50% of searches fail and investors can help in these. You get blamed for all mistakes. If a hires team doesn’t follow them it’s a red flag. You need to carve out your sales funnel and process before hiring salespeople it might be clear what you want from them. Founders can sell cold but need prospecting or other help. Founders become managers at growth stage. Founders need to know when to let go and give up responsibilities and it always happens. You need to manage people as human capital not people scaling is the founders problem. Dissociate feelings kinda a psychopath you need to fire people not feelings.

- Didn’t believe in powers of a board to get unique and actionable insights that help you it’s just a power struggle with backwards incentives it’s more show than governance. Doing pre board calls is important to get on the same page as your board and preview ideas to have them look good and get issues out of the way early. Make others feel good and special you shouldn’t feel that way. Create shadow board of seed stage vc former founder coos former founders and therapist each with their specific skill set to get a wide array of unique viewpoints. Effectively and proactively manage investors and meetings
- Terms it’s important to have lawyers who aren’t in bed with vcs they do 100s of deals with them a year and maybe 2 with you so know where their interests lie QA the docs deeply trust but verify read every line. Important to raise a random argument to see how vcs process fights and disagreements. Liz is upfront and honest and has the balls to ask crazy questions. Hire founders wiry complementary skills

- Term sheets once you get one the negotiation starts and you start shopping your competition and optimizing. It’s rare and hard to get a term sheet pulled but it does happen. If you get pulled you must wait 6 months for going out keep scaling then go out with a plausible story. Negotiate co same rights to take 5-15% off the table in further sales to ease your mind. Important to maintain pro-rata equity review this part on terms and control. 10 minutes left in ~1 hr. Have an employment agreement in place to protect you.

      Different things to go into doc negotiations
- Good founders 1. change their mind but not to easily 2. Put up with hard times but don’t fold 3. Act ship products not done spend money and delegate don’t be afraid. Test analyze and iterate on your fundraising pitch telling it in different ways to perfect it. It’s your full time job 6-8 calls a day. Never talk to associates only partners associates can only say no. Take notes on this section. Never send a deck out over email you can only control the narrative live. Make a deck only do calls in person or on video. Dress normally not too nice or bad. Don’t provide data that doesn’t serve you charts not excel. Answer questions you don’t want to ask. Don’t do more than the needed diligence 2 pitches 1 call with cto then partner meeting don’t do more. <— take notes on this. 22 minutes into 50ish minutes. Investors want to keep their optionality as long as possible. Disqualify quickly focus on what matters. You need to put yourself in a level of discomfort to actually make solid progress if you’re comfortable you’re likely wrong. Ask around to other founders for info on workers and vcs. Diligence as many decisions as you can to make an informed decision. You are a salesperson as a founder.

    - **Note:** You need to backchannel hires and investors to get who they really are every job is sales. You need to disqualify quickly investors never say no they want their optionality force their hand don't give them too much control the narrative. Playing their game is a losing proposition for you
      Change your mind and endure struggle fundraising you need to keep doing it it is your job you need to put up with high discomfort
- Family and friends $50-250k the seed $250-1mm then seed $1-3mm series a/b 3-25mm/ can be 50mm. The investors get more professional the further you get. This is the 0-1 phase. Then series c+ is the growth stage. Fundraising is hard at first because as a founder you need to find capital providers then you need to convince them to invest. Fundraising requires relationships hustling and audacity fear and anxiety have no place in this. Use crunchbase to canvas the universe of vcs who you could take money from then you need an intro. Starts with 2-3 paragraph email pitch to vc about who you are and what your idea is. With fundraising play your game. Map out the raise who you want to contact 2. Craft and test your pitch or story 3. The raise itself 4. Term sheet negotiation and then docs and close. Narrative strikes fear into the investor then you present your problem as bad don’t present competitors then serve your company as the solution show you have traction and a cohesive team and then tell them how much you want. Your job is to get to the next step. Save the later calls for deep analysis. Convince that the world is ending in the worst possible way and propose your solution. We are your savior already on a rocket ship and here is the money we want thank you. Fundraising 101. Reframe the question the what you want to answer. Pitch in waves first go to tier 4 people then slowly go to the tier one people you want and by then you’ll nail your story. Once your out the market will know it so you need to move fast and iterate to win.

- Investors and founders have differing incentives investors want a return and founders want to succeed. They’re both working toward a successful outcome but you need to be conscious and you need to trust others but likewise maintain skepticism and cover your ass in case of issues because ultimate incentives are different. Relationships and partnerships require deep trust and understanding
