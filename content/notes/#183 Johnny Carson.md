  Speaker 1
  M, so johnny starts on the tonight show in october 19 two, and then he actually retires. He sticks with the show for 30 years, retires in 19 nighty two. But this is one sentence in the book that i thought was really instructive. He caught a brak and made the most of it. And before i tell you more about how he did this, i want to tll you who the author is, so we have an idea of the subjective nature of this book. They were extremely, extreamily close for 18 years, and they had it falling out. He writes the book about a decade, decade and a half after ther falling out. So he says, i work for him for nearly two decades as lawyer, counsellor, partner, employee, business adviser, earpiece, mouthpiece, inforcer, running body tennis pal, drinking And dining companion.
  Speaker 2
  A good portion of my job entailed cleaning up his messes, business messes, personal messes and family messes.
  Speaker 1
  And one thing that i appreciate that the author talks about is it was the, by far the most complex relationship he ever had in his life, the one he loved the most and hated the most. And so as a by partr of that, wer going johnny carson. Andin the most positive attributes thatyou that a human can have, in some of the most negative, i want to go to how important he was, how important it was that he focused on his main job. And this is going to come up a lot in the book, where he's being pulled and pushed in different directions by advisers and other people, and yet he just wanted to do the tonight show.

    - **Note:** Johnny Carson was an extremely unhappy person was from Nebraska was in the army then got his chance on the tonight show as the 5th choice. He took this opportunity in stride at first he was underpaid but then gained ownership due to his being the best late night host and made 300mm due to ownership in 1980s money. He created a blueprint and set the standard in for what a talk show should be and everyone now copies his show formula to the T. He does an areal summersalt he needs to come prepared whether it’s reversing improvised segments reading books ahead of time and making the boring interesting as a relatable Midwest middle class man. Intense dedication to the craft. Johnny was a very private guy sometimes affable but sometimes incredibly difficult and tough to be around. He was very closed off and private. He played himself with his own native gifts consistency over intensity and being yourself but he struggled to create social relationships. He understood his circle of competence and wouldn’t chase more money for something he enjoyed less. Comfortable in front of 20mm uncomfortable with 20 at dinner. Johnny needed control he cheated on his wife but when his wife cheated on him he was broken. Johnny didn’t care about other people. This is written by Johnny lawyer and he said that his first 2 days in the job were unlike his first 27 years some people pack more life into their years than others.
- A Man's Life Isn't Quite What You Want It To Be
  Summary:
  The speaker reflects on his own shortcomings in his marriage and as a father, feeling regretful and disconnected.
  A newfound friend, Johnny, who seems to have it all - fame, wealth, and success - opens up about his internal struggles and unhappiness, revealing that material success doesn't guarantee a fulfilling life. The speaker emphasizes that money and fame can enhance an already great life, but they do not create happiness on their own.
  This introspective conversation highlights the theme that true contentment comes from addressing internal struggles and finding fulfillment beyond external success.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  It hurts like hell. Maybe i drove her to it. I wasn't the best husband in the world. I should ave been home more, not out running around.
  Speaker 1
  Johnny was lost in self regret and self loathing.
  Speaker 2
  I'm a shit have three kids with my first wife, and i don't see any of them. The more johnny talked, the weirder this moment seemed. People i'd known all my life, my best friends, none of them would unburden themselves to me. But here's a man i'd known for two days, and he was bearing as soul. Johnny continued, if a doctor opened my chest up right now, he couldn't find a heart or any god damn thing, just a lot of miser and it's woint to pause there before hi.
  Speaker 1
  Finishe his paragraph. Think about that. He's forty five years old. He has one of the best jobs in the world. He's famous. He's highly paid, even though he has a crappy contract, which i'll get into how they fix that in a minute, and he's not happy. And i think that's just a constant reminder that wealth, success, fame, even if if that's really what you want, i's not going to make a great life. They can add to an already existing great life, but they don't make them by themselves. And we've seen this too many times. There's too many of these books that we read, and we we discover these peope like these people are not content. There's something inside of them that they haven't dealt with. There's a hole that, no matter what they do, is much success in the moneyth they put into itit will never fill. And cn, we kind of see that with johnny. ([Time 0:21:03](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6d90f890-94d0-4c14-9857-b100af4dfed9))
    - **Note:** Johnny is incredibly rich and famous but also deeply unhappy. His mother never loved him and he struggled to be open to others. He was still blaming his mother at 45 you need to take some agency over your life. For awhile he was very poor because despite his shows success people took advantage of him and he spent a lot of money on booze. Carson gets constantly taken advantage of. You need good offense to get rich but good defense to stay rich without making stupid investments. You need to have equity in your companies and read contracts so you don’t get screwed. He put in so much to his work and was always comfortable in his skin. He put in the work to be successful and knew he was a great talent so he didn’t let anyone mess with his act but there were a lot of people who stole a lot of money from him outside his act. Also never spent time with children thought the money was enough. He was ruthlessly critical of his show rewatching every show going through what worked and didn’t and had a sense of how he did.
- Johnny's Got Brass Balls
  Key takeaways:
  - Carson's involvement in the drama was denied by the police
  - Johnny fearlessly put himself on the line to protect Joanna and her son
  - Their marital dispute lacked fundamental respect
  - Avoiding dumb things is more important than being brilliant
  - Johnny lost a lot of money due to not having a prenuptial agreement
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  The police not only hated carson's roll in the drama, they in fact denied it. The official statement said specifically that carson was never in the car, but he did take part without a moment's hesitation.
  Speaker 1
  This is one of the guys, one of the fbi agents. Johnny's got brass balls, and he did. I don't think joanna ever forgot how fearlessly johnny put himself personally on the line to protect her and her son when things soured between them.
  Speaker 2
  Her tude for his unquestioning love for her during this time, none the less, did nothing to keep their marita did nothing to keep their marial dispute on fundamentally respectful plane.
  Speaker 1
  So that's another thing always think, really, i've been trying to keep it in my mind for a long time, this idea where charliey munger says, listen, you're gong to got much farther in life by avoiding dumb things than by being brilliant. Being brilliant is almost over the long term, but being not stupid is very duable for most of us, right? And so johnny, he lost a lot of money a because he refused, first all, why your geting married if you're just going to cheat on them every day? Right?
  Speaker 2
  But then the second point is, if you're going to do that, due pre nuptial agreement, so his second wife, they get divorced, he winds up having to pay her six thousand dollars a month from 19 70 to e.
  Speaker 1
  He has to pay her six thousand dollars a month until either johnny dies or she gets remarried, whatever comes first. If somebody's paying you six thousand dollars a month, you're not going to get remarried, right? ([Time 0:37:57](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c721db5c-7014-4bc4-b879-baefc97ac97c))
    - **Note:** Johnnys wife and son were threatened for ransom they said he needed to drop the money himself but the police told him no. He refused to put their lives in danger for his and did the drop himself brass balls. Johnny also had been underpaid and fed up with nbc and threaten to quit this gave him leverage to negotiate his new contract and talked with abc about what he could make if he worked for them. This set the tone and his giant success and willingness to leave led to his great negotiation success. Johnny was suspicious of flattery but he didn’t get over his skis he had to keen an understand about the work and talent and discipline went into the success of his show. He didn’t deceive himself of what the game demanded. He knew too much of what went into success to be flattered by praise. Deep craftmenship between great idea and finished product makes you mitigate your imposter syndrome. Johnny made 25mm for working 3 night a week with 15 weeks vaca and got ownership of the show and his legacy material. Carson was a workaholic who had to work even with his limited schedule. The nights in Vegas with other comedians even 30 years later are looked back on fondly. There are moments where life happens don’t be distracted when it does.
- Jeff Bezos and Amazon
  Summary:
  The importance of empathy in leadership is highlighted in the snip.
  It is crucial for leaders to understand the feelings and perspectives of their team members to build strong relationships and foster a positive work environment. By showing empathy, leaders can inspire trust, collaboration, and productivity among their employees.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Not a scatter shot approach. Does Jeff Bezos need to make any other investments besides in the wealth that he generated from Amazon? No, Johnny didn't either. What is better use of his time and money than dedicating to his show that's going to make him hundreds of millions of dollars? I don't understand this frame of thought. So it says, with Johnny Rockefeller, the oil cartelist, that's an interesting word, Andrew Carnegie, the steel baron, Sam Walton, the retailer, and Bill Gates, the software nerd, Having common is that each owes his fortune to a single product or innovation. Bingo. Almost all of Jeff Bezos' wealth's kind of come from Amazon. Almost all of Mark Zuckerberg's wealth is going to come from Facebook. Almost all of the Google guys worth it's going to come from their own company. Johnny is no different. And so this is where, again, you're being hired to put his needs in front of your own and you get distracted. That is a cautionary tale for us. I don't think Johnny was mistaken. Like, again, he's already wealthy. His show's going to make him more money. Why is he, he starts producing other shows? He's like, I don't even like this. Like why would I do that? It just doesn't make any sense. Time is literally what life is made up of. Why would you spend it doing things you don't like to do that makes Henry's wrong here? And this is, this is here. He didn't, my next note, I ([Time 0:59:01](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c670719d-e586-4c6d-b055-83a4669b4d07))
    - **Note:** The richest people had deep focus on one project don’t get stretched too thin. Henry wanted to stretch Johnny but Johnny wanted to stay in his lane and be great in his circle of competence. Better this than getvstreched and quality degrade. Keep the main thing the main thing and constant compound your greatest areas of leverage to a point of runaway growth. Johnny when he had enough money only did what he wanted he gave up millions in the process but this was ok when he had hundreds of millions. Wise time trade off. Having enough. Henry at the end kinda Icarus’s he loses the understand he works for Johnny and tries ti go behind his back for his own benefit. He ignores advice to let things happen imposes himself and gets caught when the tide goes out. He was successful but he lost his golden goose because he didn’t realize the real situation. Johnny got wind of this running behind his back and Henry got fired. It was really all his pride that lead to massive missteps that were clearly misaligned. Know your priorities and master. Know your place. He did what was best for him when he needed to do what was best for Johnny. 18 years ended in a day. Don’t choose money over people. He got misaligned with his incentives and it destroyed a vital relationship and relationships are what life is made of not money.
