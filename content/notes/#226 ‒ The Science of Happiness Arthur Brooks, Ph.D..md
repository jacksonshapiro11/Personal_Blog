- Episode AI notes
  1. Arthur Brooks explains the evolution of cognitive strengths with age, transitioning from fluid intelligence in early adulthood to crystallized intelligence in later years, highlighting the importance of leveraging one's evolving strengths for happiness and success.
  2. Happiness is defined by three essential components: enjoyment, satisfaction, and purpose, with the happiest individuals finding fulfillment by focusing on something larger than themselves, rather than being self-absorbed.
  3. The quality of intimate relationships, particularly with a spouse, plays a crucial role in long-term happiness, underscoring the need for shared interests beyond children to avoid loneliness in later life.
  4. Friendship is categorized into levels, with the highest being the friendship of virtue, and men often struggle to form deep connections, necessitating ongoing practice to cultivate meaningful friendships.
  5. Social comparison can lead to envy and a detrimental mindset, with personal progress being best measured against one's own past rather than in relation to others, promoting a simpler, more fulfilling life through 'wants management.'
  6. Pursuing worldly success often conflicts with personal happiness, as many individuals sacrifice their well-being for status, highlighting the need to recognize and address 'success addiction.'
  7. Confronting mortality helps mitigate fear, facilitating deeper emotional connections and greater freedom in relationships, with practices like reflective exercises aiding in this process.
  8. Embracing the Four Ashramas provides a framework for fulfillment, encouraging a shift from material pursuits to personal relationships and spiritual growth as individuals age.

- Embrace Your Evolution: Fluid to Crystallized Intelligence
  Summary:
  As individuals age, their cognitive strengths evolve from fluid intelligence, characterized by innovative thinking and memory-based creativity, to crystallized intelligence, which enhances capabilities in synthesizing information and applying knowledge.
  Fluid intelligence peaks in the late 30s, enabling peak performance in tasks requiring novel idea generation, while a decline is typically noticed in the following decades. Conversely, crystallized intelligence improves over the 40s, 50s, and 60s, enhancing abilities such as teaching, pattern recognition, and management.
  This transition underscores the importance of recognizing and leveraging one's evolving strengths throughout different life stages, facilitating a shift from purely innovative roles to positions that capitalize on mentorship, synthesis, and experience, leading to fulfilling pursuits aligned with accumulated knowledge and expertise.

  I was becoming effectively a better teacher, better instructor, but I was worse as a classic innovator. When I first come to AEI, I was developing new programs. I was coming up with these new big policy and research ideas. And about halfway through, I was noticing that what I was really good at was synthesizing everybody else's ideas and putting them together into a relatively compelling argument about How we should do things, which was interesting to me. But it also occurred to me that it was probably more to it than that. I got to work on where this was going to lead in my own life such that I could exploit my own strengths optimally. And I started looking at the research on different forms of intelligence as people get older. What it led me to conclude based on the work of a lot of social psychologists that were doing intelligence work in the 1960s and 70s, actually, it was older work out of the UK. Primarily the work of Raymond Cattell is that early on, we have a fluid intelligence, which is largely our innovative capacity based on working memory, where we can do a lot of things Alone and come up with brand new ideas based on kind of limited background. Later on, we're less good at that, but we're much better at synthesizing ideas. We have a vast library, much less working memory, but a much better vocabulary, pattern recognition and ability to synthesize ideas of other people, which is called crystallized Intelligence. Now, what we find is that fluid intelligence tends to peak in the late 30s, which is, by the way, why a lot of classical musicians are peaking in their late 30s, is because fluid intelligence Is not just about writing mathematical formulas. It's about doing a lot of things that make you great with your 10,000 hours of practice and your masterate, et cetera, et cetera. And then it declines in your 40s and 50s, but your crystallized intelligence, your teaching capacity, your explaining capacity, your pattern recognition, your management of other People, that those things get better through your 40s and 50s and 60s and stay high in your 70s and 80s. And then you're like, well, what am I going to do? What's my plan so that I can exploit that for the rest of my career? And that's actually what led me to quit my CEO job and to do what I do now, which is writing and speaking and teaching, really using my creative capacities to mix ideas together about happiness, Which is my main area of focus and research.

- Happiness Flourishes from Enjoyment, Satisfaction, and Purpose
  Summary:
  Happiness is defined not merely as a fleeting feeling but as a state characterized by three essential components: enjoyment, satisfaction, and purpose.
  Enjoyment transcends simple pleasure, requiring shared experiences that create lasting memories. Satisfaction is linked to achieving goals, providing a sense of joy and fulfillment.
  Purpose extends beyond personal aspirations to encompass a broader, transcendental understanding of life, offering meaning and direction.
  The happiest individuals find peace and perspective by focusing on something larger than themselves.
  Those who lack happiness often become preoccupied with self-focused concerns, which is detrimental to their well-being. Emphasizing these three macro nutrients can significantly enhance one’s happiness span.

  Speaker 1
  What's happiness? They'll say, it's that feeling I get on Thanksgiving and, you know, yada, yada, yada, feelings, feelings that have wrong. Happiness is not a feeling anymore than your Thanksgiving dinner is the smell of the turkey. The feeling of happiness is evidence of happiness. Now we measure happiness in all sorts of very complicated and very simple ways. And one of the things that we know is that all of the people who are really happy who have a lot of happy feelings, but also have a lot of satisfaction content with their lives, they're getting Abundance and balance across three dimensions. And so this is the definition of happiness. Now think about this. Like if I were to say, hey, Peter, what is the Thanksgiving dinner? You'd say, well, carbohydrates, proteins and fat, you know, you'd say there's the three macro nutrients of all food. And you know, we're always trying to get our macros in order. Forget lifespan. Let's talk about health span. And I say, let's take it even farther to happiness span. So let's get our literal macro nutrients in order for health span. Let's get our happiness span in order with the macro nutrients of happiness. They are enjoyment, satisfaction and purpose. Those are the three macro nutrients of happiness. If you don't have those things and balance and abundance, you will not report being a happy person. Now this is different than unhappiness, which is another entire subject. Believe it or not, happiness and unhappiness are not opposites. They're different phenomena. So we're just talking about happiness here to be a truly happy person. You need to enjoy your life. And that requires not pleasure. It's pleasure plus elevation is pleasure plus metacognition. You know, Thanksgiving dinner fills your belly and tastes good. That's pleasure. But the experience that you have of consuming the Thanksgiving dinner with other people and having a memory that you can last forever, that's enjoyment. And so it's a much more elevated experience than pleasure satisfaction, which is super fleeting and troublesome and, you know, as Mick Jagger saying, I can't get no satisfaction. The truth is you can't keep no satisfaction. There's an entire research literature on that that I've participated in on the problem with satisfaction, but it's the joy and reward for a job well done and a goal met, you know, that Elation from actually meeting a goal. And last but not least is purpose is meaning in life. I talk an awful lot about the coherence, the significance, the direction, the meaning of meaning and it gets back to a lot of the great philosophy, but we can also measure it. I have a few diagnostic questions that I ask for the claims who come to me and they'd lack purpose in their life. The questions I ask are, why were you born and for what are you willing to die? And if you can't answer one or both of those questions, you have a serious meaning problem. We got to dig in and actually dissolve that particular problem. But that's it. I mean, these are the three macro nutrients, the protein carbohydrates and fat of happiness are enjoyment, satisfaction and purpose.
  Speaker 2
  There's so much I want to touch on there. I'll start with the latter. I have to be honest with you and I've thought about this a lot. In terms of purpose, I literally can only think of one thing and I suspect a lot of people will think of this, which is kids. I think that's probably the only thing I would say I have a real purpose for that I would die for in a second and think nothing of. Is it bad that I don't have a higher purpose than that?
  Speaker 1
  It sort of depends on what the higher purpose means. One of the things that you find is that one of the habits of the happiest people, think of this as the dishes and the happiness meals, suppose that the macro nutrients and the happiness Meal, the happiest people, they all have a transcendental understanding of life. It's just to say that they have an understanding of life bigger than themselves. The most miserable people, the people who lack happiness and have a lot of unhappiness, they're focusing on me, me, me, me. The philosophers talk about the I self and the me self and the I self is outward looking its observational as sort of zen. The me self is reflective of the outside world. It has a lot to do with social comparison. It has a lot to do with the micro circumstances. My job, my money, my career, my friends, my house, my mortgage, my commute, me, me. It's just so boring. And a transcendental understanding of life is key to a happy life because you need peace. You need perspective. You need to zoom out when the Dalai Lama says you are one in seven billion. What he's saying is not that you're insignificant or you're the spec. What he's saying is that you need to stop focusing on yourself so you can actually get some relief once in a while. So that might be the higher purpose, but it's just a transcendental purpose and understanding of something bigger than yourself. So that's another thing. And I know you have that. I know you think about things that are bigger than you. And part of that is your family and part of that's your kids. But part of that is an understanding of the universe. ([Time 0:26:25](https://share.snipd.com/snip/49333853-e2b9-4e58-b55f-39e0afa0a814))
    - **Note:** The building blocks of happiness meaning satisfaction and purpose. Happy people have a transcendent view of life and the unhappy people have a me centric narcissistic view of the world more externally driven. More Buddhist transcendent view. Understanding things bigger than yourself
- Friendship is the Foundation of Lasting Happiness
  Summary:
  The quality of intimate relationships, especially with a spouse, significantly impacts long-term happiness.
  A deep, friendly companionship is essential, as it provides emotional security and connection, particularly during life transitions like an empty nest. It’s critical for partners to maintain common interests beyond their children, as relying solely on them can lead to loneliness and dissatisfaction once the kids grow up.
  While many happy individuals find fulfillment in a marriage, those without a partner can still achieve happiness through deep, meaningful friendships.
  Real friendships, characterized by mutual support and understanding, are necessary for emotional well-being.
  It's important for individuals, particularly men, to cultivate these friendships, as they often struggle to maintain close connections outside of their romantic relationships. The lack of such bonds can lead to isolation and unhappiness, especially during challenging times like loss. Ultimately, pursuing both a strong partnership and genuine friendships forms the foundation of lasting happiness.

  Speaker 2
  You know, recently I posted something on Instagram that I found really depressing, which was a chart of the fraction of time that people spend with others in their life over the course Of their life. So it's kind of like the x-axis is time and the y-axis is percent spent with each entity and it's various curves. And the one that just depressed the hell out of me was time with your kids, which basically corresponds to once they turn 18, it just plummets. Now you've got kids that are, you have three kids, right? Yeah, my three kids have grown up.
  Speaker 1
  Youngest is 19 in Spain, in college. I know all about how the empty nest works. And there were times, I mean, like I've been in your house and there's a lot of Legos on the ground and there's a lot of chaos that comes from little kids. I remember that in my wife and I, we said, you know, what's it going to be like when actually, you know, they grow up and move out. And it is very different and it's very disconcerting and it's kind of new to us, quite frankly. But the key is, and this is one of the most important things for a happy life, is a partnership with somebody who will be the last person on whom you lay your eyes as you take your dying breath. That's really, really important, a companion love that is your wife. That turns out to be much more indicative of your happiness than actually getting the developing and having a continuing relationship with your kids because your kids are turning Into different people every single year. I mean, that's super fun and that's super interesting. But that's actually not the key. The people who suffer the most from empty nest syndrome is not the empty nest. It's the fact that they're only with one other bird and they don't really like that bird very much. That's the real problem is when it comes in. And that's one of the things that I talk about with my students. And by the way, I'm doing lots of executive teaching these days. And that's what I'm talking about with people. Our age too is the goal of your marriage is not passion. It's friendship. This is the goal. You must be close friends, ideally best friends with your spouse, such that your kids, they grow up and they move away and then you have your grandkids. I'm probably going to have grandkids within my oldest son is married. They're going to have kids quick at bed. I don't know, you can tell them I'm projecting and praying about this. But then I'll have grandkids and it'll be a different experience. But I'm going to be with my wife Esther and Phil left to us part. So that has to be the juice of the relationship or the love that actually makes true happiness and love truly is the great secret to happiness.
  Speaker 2
  That's the one saving grace is as I feel very fortunate that my wife and I are. We joke that we're the best roommates in the world. I think we'll have a lot to enjoy in that transition. Is the implication of that though Arthur that because I don't think it is, but how do we reconcile then a person who chooses not to have a partner?
  Speaker 1
  There are some people who do really, really well on their own that you know, introverts who like to live alone for example and loneliness is not the same thing as solitude. Isolation and solitude are very, very different phenomena. By the way, they're neuro cognitively different phenomena. They affect the brain in different ways. So isolation is always bad, but solitude is not as matter of fact, we all need it. We need it in different levels.
  Speaker 2
  That's point one. That's point two and actually this is based on the harvest. I'm sorry just interrupted for his agar there.
  Speaker 1
  You can be lonely in a relationship and you can be in solitude and not be lonely. Absolutely. One of the greatest predictors of divorce is partners who are lonely while living together. This gets back to the big danger of the M.T.S. Syndrome is that the only thing you have in common is your kids and that one point of commonality disappears and you're sitting across the table blinking at each other during dinner Not talking because you literally don't even need to talk about that's metastatically awful for a relationship. And so that's why it's critically important that couples have something in common besides their kids that they're practicing their religion together. They're practicing interest together. They're reading the same things. They're on the same philosophical journey together. I mean, one of the things that I talk about with couples is that they should develop philosophical interests and comment. They're talking about deep things. The gold standards that your kids are like, ah, mom and dad are talking about care, care care again or whatever. I mean, it's got to be something that's bigger than digit change is diaper. That's not going to be something you have in common forever and you're going to be lonely inside your relationship. The second big point, however, is that whereas most of the truly happy people as they get older, they do have a spousal partner where that's companion in terms of its love, which also Has some passion, but the companion part is a send it throughout your marriage. Whereas the passion part is not as high as it used to be. And that's completely okay. That's healthy, normal and actually advisable because it's more sustainable over the long run. But some people are very happy and don't have that. What do they have in common? Very, very close personal lifelong friends. So here's the key. If you don't have a spouse, you need real friends. These are people who know your secrets who would take your 2 AM phone call and that you talk to a lot. Now that doesn't mean that if you're married, you don't need that because when I talk to especially men, men are horrible at real friendships, they're the worst. They got lots of deal friends, but no real friends a lot of the time, especially if they're really successful in business. And so we'll say, okay, name 2 guys or whoever who are real friends besides your spouse. And they're like, yeah, so and so and so and so. And I'll say, what was the last thing we talked to him? He's like, I don't know, 4 months ago, not a close friend. That's just the case. And so you got to work on these things for sure for a lot of reasons besides the fact that it's just healthy and good. You also might at some point be left alone if you're widowed and you don't want to be alone in the world in those circumstances. That's really corrosive. That's one of the reasons that men do so poorly when they lose their wives to death. A lot of them don't have real friendships to backfill any of this need and their souls. Why? ([Time 0:31:19](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d4f70a57-a7b1-4f6f-820d-803c1a8f505b))
    - **Note:** Empty nesters and what to look for in a life partner. Being lonely in a relationship. Develop philosophical connections with your spouse that transcend things you do have deep meaningful conversations. You need a spouse and real friends. Having close male friendship ships that are more than surface level. Bond of the soul.
- Friendship Evolves Through Depth and Virtue
  Summary:
  Friendship exists on different levels, beginning with transactional relationships that are short-lived and based on mutual benefit, such as business partnerships.
  Above this, friendships of admiration or beauty arise from appreciating each other's qualities, yet these also depend on specific attributes. The highest form of friendship, known as the friendship of virtue, is intrinsically satisfying and often revolves around shared interests or activities that may be seemingly trivial but are meaningful and allow for deeper connections.
  Men often struggle to form these deep friendships due to generational and intrinsic differences.
  Traditionally, men have focused on work and family as their primary relationships, leading to reduced social practices surrounding friendship.
  In contrast, women are typically more engaged in nurturing social connections, resulting in richer friendships over time. Building friendships is a skill that requires ongoing practice, similar to exercising a muscle. Without consistent effort, individuals, particularly men, may find themselves ill-equipped to create and maintain strong friendships, leading to feelings of loneliness and disconnection as they age. To foster real friendships, one must actively learn and practice the art of cultivating and sustaining these deep, meaningful connections.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So this is actually an Aristotelian notion, believe it or not. We do a lot of this stuff in our mathematical social sciences as well, but all the things that we do in behavioral social sciences now, all we're doing is we're just exposing the ancients To empirical scrutiny. We're just testing whether or not Aristotel was right, which he always is. So Aristotel wrote a lot about friendships. And he talked about these escalating levels of friendship in terms of the satisfaction that they bring in the virtue that they bring to our lives. The lowest level is the friendships of transaction. So these are friendships where people work together. And they're really, you're a shirt manufacturer and you've got a guy who sells you cloth. And your friends, you probably really are. I mean, you like them. He likes you. You're really friendly with each other. You take care not to offend each other. But if you stop making shirts, you're probably not going to continue that relationship. Above that are relationships of admiration or beauty where you admire each other. And that's a really good thing too. But that's dependent on a particular quality. The perfect friendship or the friendship of virtue is just inherently satisfying. You'll like being together. Frequently it'll revolve around a third kind of useless thing like baseball. This is what guys do. It's like, I don't know, what do you guys do together? I don't know, we build birdhouses or whatever it happens to be. And it's that third thing that is the focus. But what you're doing in parallels developing a very beautiful friendship, a very positive link. And that's what these real friendships have in common. They're intrinsically satisfying and they're frequently focused on the cosmic third thing. It doesn't have to be useless by the way. I mean, I have a very close friend, one of my very closest friends is he's in Atlanta. And we have the same religion and we talk about that a lot. Our discussions about that are quite deep and he also wants to know what's going on with my marriage and my kids. And he knows my secrets is the bottom line.
  Speaker 2
  You alluded to something that I think most people intuitively would appreciate, but I'm curious as to why. What is it about men that makes it harder for us to have those really deep friendships? Again, if I were to consider my parents, I don't think my father has one such friendship. I think my mother has many, really many. She's rich in friendship. Maybe they're an extreme example. Why do you think that is?
  Speaker 1
  Well, there's some generational differences between men and women and there are probably some intrinsic differences as well. The generational differences largely have to do with the fact that in conventional family setups, I mean, I'm going to guess that your dad was super hardworking. He probably was busting his pick all the way through your childhood. He put you through college. He did all that stuff. And he knew that he was gone all day. And then if he went down to goof around with his buddies after work, he was stealing from his family. And so he came home. The truth was that his intimate relationships were in his family and his business relationships were at work. And there was a firewall between the two such that he could afford to spend adequate time, where he had adequate time to spend with his family. And so that was a very traditional situation. Meanwhile, your mom was making sure that you kids were properly brought up and you had friends and she knew your friends' mothers. And the result was that she was reinforcing friendship relationships and therefore getting better at them. So the distressing thing is that friendship is a skill that requires practice. It's like a muscle and it will atrophy. You can get worse and worse at friendships. And so I'll meet these 60 year old guys. Guys were a little older than me and they'll be like, what do you want me to do? Call up some other dude and ask for a play date? I mean, how does one do this? I don't know how to do this. I haven't had a real friend since I was in college. And ever since then, then I got married and had my family and I worked really, really hard. And now I'm lonely. And so what do you expect me to do? And the answer is you have to actually learn how to make and maintain friends, real friendships. And that's the skill that a lot of men lose because of our traditional social circumstances. ([Time 0:36:57](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f89e3c8e-b1fc-4a30-979c-2101ce6447af))
    - **Note:** Types of friendships transactional admiration and virtuous friendship for its own sake. Why guys don’t have many close friends vs women. Friendship is a muscle. True friends are vulnerable with each other you need to genuinely care about other people to form friendships.
- Envy Chills Progress; True Mastery Reveals Essence
  Summary:
  Social comparison often leads to a detrimental mindset where self-worth is tied to others, fostering envy, which is deemed the most joyless of vices.
  Progress should be gauged against one’s own past, rather than in relation to others, as personal development is about intrinsic enjoyment derived from activities rather than mere achievement. Life should be viewed as a sculpture, where one chips away at extraneous desires and ambitions to reveal one's true self, especially as one matures.
  The concept of 'wants management' suggests adopting a reverse bucket list approach, wherein one consciously detaches from worldly ambitions, leading to a more fulfilling existence free from the chains of success addiction.
  This strategy encourages a simpler, yet enriched life, aiming for progress without the burdens of comparison and relentless ambition, resulting in true mastery of one’s life and inner fulfillment.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  That's a- That'll never happen. And to be clear, I wasn't suggesting that the former was less insidious than the latter. I just wonder what the difference is because the problem with the former is whether it's playing something on the French horn or swimming, those tend to rely on going back to fluid intelligence, What we've just established that that's probably going to peak in your thirties. So whether it be athletic achievements or whatever, they're probably going to start going down.
  Speaker 1
  For sure. Now, the biggest problem with social comparison, or there's nothing good of a social comparison. We do it because we have to. And part of the reason is we have to understand what we're doing. We have to understand who we are and where we're going. And that means, and we're part of a society. So there's a natural fabric of comparisons that are happening all the time. But actually trying to understand your own self-worth in comparison to other people is really the worst tyranny that leads to envy. Joe Epstein, who's the great essayist says that envy is the only deadly sin that's not even fun. I mean, it's just misery. My dad used to do it. My dad was a really funny guy. He said, joke, it's not enough to win, son. Your friends have to lose too. Right? He was like, it's horrible because it actually tears all the people down. You can feel awful about yourself not withstanding the fact that you're creating real value in Dante down to the bottom of Mount Purgatory that he finds Satan. And Satan at the worst of the deadly sins is actually half frozen in a block of ice and twisting an agony in this ice. And he's keeping the ice solid because of the wind from his wings where he's fruitlessly trying to get away. And in such agony, he doesn't even notice the narrator of the inferno going down to the bottom of Mount Purgatory. This is analogy. It's not envy isn't fire. You're frozen. It's awful. There's two commandments against it. It's so bad. It's the whole idea. Okay. So when you're comparing yourself with yourself, that's just looking for progress. Mathematicians will say that all of happiness is in the first derivative progress off the baseline. That's what you want is progress. And that's really good. The problem is that's insidious too because that's also on the treadmill. The true master will be getting intrinsic enjoyment from the thing that she or he is doing. That's what the true master actually gets. And that's the goal that we should all be going for. And the way to do that is to have this idea of wants management. There are other ways to put it this and other ways to actually get it this as well. I like the metaphor of instead of adding brush strokes to your, the canvas of your life, start thinking of your life as a sculpture where you have to chip away until you find the true Peter.
  Speaker 2
  Tell that story. Actually, you wrote about that in the book. I believe you were in the museum and was in Taiwan. Yeah. I was in the house museum in Taiwan, which is the greatest collection of Chinese art and artifacts in the world for the Paleolithic and to the present.
  Speaker 1
  When you go to a museum, never go by yourself because you'll remember nothing except the snack bar. You got to go with somebody who will show you 10 things. Get a guy, as they say in the vernacular and say, I want to understand deeply 10 things. That's the way to go to any museum. And so I hired a guy and he was a philosopher and an expert in both Eastern and Western art. So looking at this block of jade that was carved, a two ton block of jade carved intricately into a village, a village scene. I said, even if I'd never seen any Chinese art in person and I were not in Taiwan, if I were in Dayton right now, I'd know this is Chinese. How? He says, oh, it's just that the whole philosophy is different between Western and Eastern art. And I said, what is it? He said, well, Western art uses the metaphor of starting with nothing and then creating something. The Eastern art, the idea is starting with everything there and chipping away until you reveal it. Now this is true in music too. You'll find in Eastern classical art traditions. You have studied Hindustani classical music, you know, Raga. For example, I studied tabla, which is the North Indian classical drumming. The ensemble will be as small as it needs to be, such that nothing is extraneous. Whereas in a Western orchestra, simply in orchestra, there's 85 people cranking in 100 decibels. And the East, I'll say, I can't even hear the music of a symphony orchestra because there's too much going on. It's the same kind of metaphor. Well, your life in the first part is usually a canvas. By the time you're 45 of your successful person, that canvas is full, man. It's like Jackson Pollock. You know, add one more brushstroke and it adds nothing that you can possibly, it probably gets worse. It's just dense and dark at that particular time. You got to move to the metaphor of the block of Jade that you chip away until you actually find the beautiful thing that's in you. And the goal for the second half of life, certainly after 45 years old, is each year having less, each year getting rid of more relationships that are extraneous, more possessions, More ambitions, more experiences. And the way that I do that, I actually have a practical way of doing it. I was a young guy, like everybody else had a bucket list. I'm a very ambitious guy. I've gone from career to career, try to do a lot with my life. And I had a bucket list, all the things that I wanted, all it did make me feel like a loser. You know, it's like all these things that are unfulfilled and it kept me fired up, to be sure. But now I have a reverse bucket list where I make a list of all of my worldly cravings and ambitions and I might get them and I might not. What I'm not is I make a conscious metacognitive commitment to not be attached to the things on that reverse bucket list. I'm not attached to my opinions in the same way that I was. My political views, I'm not attached to the ambitions that will show me that I'm Mr. Big along the way. It might happen, it might not happen. But when I make a commitment consciously to detach myself from those things, it's like chipping away and I'm telling you Peter, it is very, very effective for helping you with a wants Management strategy such that you can have a big fulfilling life that's enviable by any outward standard. But at the same time, not be chained to it in this insidious kind of success addiction that brings so many successful people so much unhappiness. ([Time 0:49:46](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4d8bb77a-7acf-4d03-bf1b-c35941200817))
    - **Note:** Sculpting not painting your life. Getting off the hedonic treadmill through satisfaction and happiness. Social comparison and envy are horrible. Each year is not being attached and letting go of more things every year that you want to do so you can do what you need to do. The anti bucket list. Manage your wants. Don’t step forward be happy in the moment. Pursuit is often empty at the end and we lie to ourselves just enjoy the ride.
- Prioritize Happiness Over Success
  Summary:
  Happiness and worldly success often conflict, as many successful individuals sacrifice their well-being in pursuit of power, fame, and money.
  Research suggests that the happiest people may not be the most successful according to societal metrics. This discrepancy arises from the risk of developing a 'success addiction' where individuals prioritize status and accomplishments over personal happiness and fulfilling relationships.
  This phenomenon resembles behavioral addictions, such as workaholism, where the drive for external accolades can detract from essential aspects of life, including family, health, and well-being.
  Recognizing whether one is feeding this addiction is crucial for achieving a balanced and fulfilling life.

  Speaker 2
  You wrote something that I want to say it's been in the last couple of months in the Atlantic about happiness and success and noting that the happiest people weren't necessarily the Most successful. If I'm remembering that correctly, I think you wrote this in maybe April. You might have been June, but it looked at some data that suggested actually a little bit of sacrifice in happiness led to greater success. Am I remembering that sort of correctly?
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, that's right. And part of the reason is because people who are tremendously successful in worldly terms, when I'm talking about success, we can define it in different ways, right? Having a lifelong marriage where you're in love with your spouse, that's unbelievably successful. Believing like you have found spiritual transcendence, that's unbelievably successful. Living for the good of other people, tremendously successful. But that's not what we're talking about. We're talking about worldly success, money, power, fame, the admiration of other people. So that these particular metrics of success. People who are remarkably successful along those worldly metrics, they're making cost benefit calculations systematically that are not in their own happiness favor, typically. They're making sacrifices to their own happiness for some reason. And this is one of the things that I've looked at in my own research. Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? I was talking to a woman. One of the things that I do as a social scientist, I'm not just cranking data. I go out and talk to the humans, which I find is a really beneficial thing to do. And I was interviewing this unbelievably successful woman on Wall Street, billionaire business started to epic success after success and very well done. And she was confessing to me that she was missing decisions that people were doubting it that at the same time that she and her husband were just roommates, that she had a cordial relationship With her adult kids, that she was starting to get bad blood work back for her doctor. She thinks that she was probably drinking too much. She couldn't sleep right and the whole thing. She said, what do you do? You don't need a nerd from Harvard to tell you what to do. You told me you're a billionaire. Step back from your company, take a souvenir in it, go on to the board, whatever, get to know your husband, risk double relationship with your kids. Start to take care of your drinking problem, become a client of Peter Attia. I don't know. You know what I'm talking about here. I say, why don't you do these things? She thought about it. She said, I guess I'd prefer to be special than happy.
  Speaker 3
  And I thought she'd...
  Speaker 1
  That is the hallmark of addiction. I used to be a musician. I've met a lot of addicts. I've met a lot of alcoholics in my life. And they will confess that before they got clean and sober that they preferred to be high than happy. They all said that. They knew that they'd be happier when they were finally beyond this thing. But let's just get high one more time. Just the feel of that pipe on my lips one more time, just the burning of the alcohol in my throat. One more time, just the... What do William Broughs call the red, the blood in the hypodermic needle before you actually put down the plunger. It gives incredible pleasure to people. And they say, just one more time, just one more time. And that's what that lady was saying to me. That's a success addiction that is absolutely implicated in the dopamine system. And that is like any other behavioral addiction and that a lot of very worldly successful people fall prey to a lot of people listening to us. And I'm glad they're listening to us right now because they want an edge. But you got to ask yourself, Arthur has to ask himself and Peter has to ask himself and all the people listening to them have to ask themselves, is this a pathology that I'm actually feeding By actually trying to get this edge? And I hope it's not. And I hope it's not for me. But I know a lot of people where it is. We talk about workaholism. There's a lot of literature on workaholism. Workaholism is an ancillary addiction to success addiction. People work really, really hard. The payoff, the cookie that you get, the dopamine is just driving you to is the promotion, is the raise, is the dollar, is the compliment, is the adulation on social media. That's where the real addiction is coming in. ([Time 1:04:08](https://share.snipd.com/snip/42747847-e513-4c04-ac5b-8df9510d05da))
    - **Note:** We know what we don’t be happy but we’d rather be high than happy and feel special. Happiness and success. The most important things to you will likely be your emotional health your key relationship and your kids. You can be successful and happy when you seperate your happiness from the praise of others and instead do it for its own sake and be happy and that usually leads to more success intrinsic motivation.
- Embrace Mortality to Conquer Fear
  Summary:
  Confronting mortality serves as a powerful method to mitigate fear, particularly the fear that inhibits love and happiness.
  Love and fear are opposites; while love fosters happiness, fear can extinguish it. Rooted in both philosophical principles and neuroscience, this connection implies that embracing love can neutralize fears, and addressing the fear of mortality can unlock deeper emotional connections.
  Most people harbor unacknowledged fears surrounding death, often linked to concerns about being forgotten or feeling irrelevant.
  This existential dread can manifest in varied ways, such as fear of failure, particularly among high achievers who associate their worth with success.
  To tackle these fears, a reflective exercise akin to a therapeutic meditation based in Theravada Buddhism encourages individuals to consciously familiarize themselves with their mortality, gradually dampening fear’s hold. By repeatedly exposing oneself to thoughts of personal failure or decay, one can alleviate the terror associated with these fears, leading to greater freedom and enhanced relationships. Engaging in structured reflection about these fears is essential; individuals may find that their relationship with death and failure evolves over time, requiring continuous introspection and meditation to maintain emotional clarity and resilience.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  But the result is that of all of this is that this is a lot of what leads to people's fears. People talk to me a lot about what they're most afraid of. I ask people about that a lot. And part of the reason is because my main focus of my happiness work is love and love and fear are opposites. Love and hatred are not opposites. Hatred is downstream from fear. And this is a philosophical principle from Lao Tzu in St. John the Apostle, but it's also a neurocognitive regularity where you find that how the brain works, you tend to find that love neutralizes fear and fear can turn off love in every other Feeling like a switch because of the way that brain is designed. The main focus of my work in happiness is the subject of love. And part of the reason is because love is the nuclear fuel runs of happiness. If you want to know one thing about how to be happy, happiness is love full stop. And there's a ton of longitudinal data that shows this. There's a ton of data that shows people who are in their 80s and 90s who are really happy. If you look back in their 20s and 30s and 40s and 50s, what they all have in common is drawing relationships that they were cultivating and working on, real love relationships in terms
  Speaker 2
  Of romance and family and real friends, not just the old friends.
  Speaker 1
  Now the interesting thing is when you're studying love is you also have to study its opposite. And the opposite of love is fear. That's a philosophical truism. You know, Lao Tzu talked about the fact that fear and love are opposites. And we teach on the apostle, but also we find this in modern neuroscience in the way that emotions are processed in the human brain. Psychology shows this abundantly that love and hatred in opposites, hatred is downstream from fear. So if you want to understand what turns off love in your life, when people come to me and say, I don't have enough love, I'll say, well, tell me about what you're afraid of. And when people come to me and they say they have too much fear in their life, we'll say, well, I need more relationships. We need more love to neutralize the fear. So the big fears that I ask people about, one of the things that I find is that everybody has a deaf fear. This is an interesting thing. You know, most people say, I'm not afraid of dying. And I'm not afraid of dying. I mean, like Peter, you and I are like, the reaper comes tomorrow. I was like, okay, I live right. I'm actually not afraid of that. But I do have a deaf fear. Everybody does. And it has to do with the extinction of how you understand yourself. And that gets back to the mortality paradox. The idea of not existing has some manifestation almost everybody's life, whether it's, I'm really afraid of becoming irrelevant. I'm really afraid of being forgotten. That's your mortality problem. That's your death fear. You know, for me, it's like, I think about it. The one thing about my health I'm most worried about is dementia. My mother was demented. I was in early stage dementia, when she was my age. She was mid 50s. She was in early stage dementia. She lived for another 15 years. But it was really, really bad. It was really a bad ending. And for me, I mean, my whole living is inside my head. I work on my biceps, but it doesn't matter how strong they are for me to be able to make a living and support my family and support my employees, etc. So that really freaks me out. Well, guess what? That's my death fear. It's the functioning of my brain is my death fear. Everybody has something like this, whether it's really ego related or has to do with skill related, everybody's got their mortality terror. This is one of the things that we need to dominate if we want to be happy. And I have an exercise, believe it or not, Peter, that I give my students on how to do that. Number one is you have to figure out what it is. You have to do some serious reflection on what your death fear is. And for most of my students at Harvard is fear of failure. These are super high performing. I mean, this was you. I mean, you went to Stanford and then you did all this fancy college stuff. And so my guess is that you never had any academic failure and you were perhaps pretty afraid of academic failure because you'd never experienced it. And because it would have been problematic in your family. If you had started to fail some classes in college, I was going to guess, right?
  Speaker 2
  I'm a bit confused because what you spoke about earlier makes a lot of sense as a death failure because I see a cognitive decline being tied to physical death because it's an end of life Thing. I'm a bit confused about what the students, these 29 year olds are equating failure in life, for example, starting a business and having it fail with actual death.
  Speaker 1
  So it's basically I am a success machine. Most of my students start off as very objectified by their parents where their parents say, you're the special one, you're successful, you always get age, you're a hard worker, you Know, get it done. And they start to see themselves as kind of homo economicus. They see themselves as high performers and they're very bright and they're very hard working in the results. They don't experience any failure in school. I mean, for me, these are absurd things. You got to be on an exam who cares. You know, I've flunked out of college. Man, I know failure, but for them, they've never experienced these things. So it feels like a mortal threat because it's a threat to who they think they are, which is a successful person, somebody who never fails and is very foreign territory to them. So whether they're deaf fears, failure or cognitive decline or being forgotten or being irrelevant or actually dying, the technique for getting beyond this is really all the same. And it comes from that I found very successful is to do what is called a Theravada Buddhism, the Maranasati meditation. This is the nine part death meditation that Theravada Buddhist monks in Sri Lanka and Thailand and Vietnam. They will undertake in which often they'll contemplate corpses, photos of corpses in various states of decay. And they'll say, that is me and that is me. And they have a nine for this Maranasati is a meditation in which they imagine themselves decaying, dying and then a rotting bloated corpse. And then it's so graphic is super graphic. It's a boy.
  Speaker 2
  And that's the point and super accurate. Like it really is how a human corpse decays.
  Speaker 1
  It's just unbelievable. And what you're trying to do is what psychologists would call exposure therapy. You're exposing yourself to the inevitable truth. Like I heard you say, Peter, I'm going to die. Okay, fine, fine, fine. I'm going to think, no, think about it. Think about it. Why? Beca... ([Time 1:15:42](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9ff55cef-5a4c-4c1b-b174-9bd925553808))
    - **Note:** Mortality paradox fear and love are opposites and we must cultivate love and mitigate fear. Meditate on death or even deep loss of something in your life like. What is your deepest darkest pain or secret live in that to move past it. Fear of death or things like death. The steps you need to take to conquer your fear.
- Embrace the Four Ashramas for a Fulfilling Life
  Summary:
  Embracing the Four Ashramas—Brahmacarya, Grihastha, Vana Prastha, and Sannyasa—provides a framework for a fulfilling life.
  Brahmacarya, the first phase, focuses on learning and personal growth. Grihastha, the second phase, emphasizes worldly achievements such as family, career, and acquiring material success.
  Transitioning from Grihastha to Vana Prastha around age 50 marks a significant shift; it requires letting go of distractions and desires for worldly rewards in favor of teaching and serving others.
  This phase cultivates a second curve of growth rather than personal ambition.
  The final ashrama, Sannyasa, around age 75, is dedicated to spiritual enlightenment and deeper understanding, necessitating years of preparation and training. The fulfillment lies not in reliving past ambitions but in embracing love, faith, family, and service as pivotal aspects of a contented life later on. Recognizing this shift allows individuals to maximize their 'happy span' by focusing on personal relationships and inner growth rather than transient desires.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Talk about the four ashrams. I know they're divided into sort of 25 year chunks. I find this very interesting what those four stages are, especially, I guess, as you pointed out, I'm about to be 50. So I'm really ending the second one about to enter the third. And it's really the second one. It's the hardest one, I think, to leave, isn't it?
  Speaker 1
  Yeah. These are called ashramas. What it means is the quarters of a perfect life, in Vedic philosophy. So really ancient Indian wisdom. These ideas are probably 5,000 years old. I have studied with a lot of these very deep Hindu masters in Southern India. When every time I go to India, I try to sit at the feet of one of these masters and they'll say, you're Christian, right? He says, you think all these things that we used to think 4,000 years ago. But I went to India specifically to study the ashramas with a wonderful guru in a place called Palakad in Southern India on the border between Kerala and Tamil Nadu, which is these two Southern states. And his name is Sri Noatur Venkatarama. And I asked him about these ashramas, which are the four quarters of a well balanced and perfect life, ideally 25 years each. Now the odds of getting to 100 are one in 6,000 in the United States that ain't a lot lower than that in India. So the point is not to be dogmatic about turning 50, Peter. What we're really talking about is just these chunks of life. The first phase of life is called brahmacarya, which is the student life. And all that means is not necessarily literally a student. It means the time when you're learning, when you're absorbing, when you are a sponge for human capital and ideas. Then around age 25 is when you enter Grihastha, which is typically when a man, for example, would get married and sort of household. And that's called the householder phase. And that's career and marriage and children and success and sexual relationships and all of these kind of worldly rewards of money, power, pleasure and fame. That's when you get addicted to those worldly rewards of money, power, pleasure and fame. And it's fun and it's good and it's hard and it's tiring, et cetera, et cetera. Whereas in the West, we talk about that one hard transition from kid to adult from brahmacarya degree, hasta. And in India, they talk about the difficulty of the second adolescence, which is passing out of Grihastha into the third phase around 50, which is called Vana Prastha. That's 50 to 75. And that's a really critical and very interesting phase. It's hard to get into because it requires wanting less. It requires chipping away. It requires a reverse bucket list. What it requires, it's an Vana Prastha comes from two Sanskrit words, van and Prastha. It means to retire into the forest. Obviously, I'm not going to go live in the forest and either you. The whole point is to retire away from a lot of the parts of Grihastha. You're still going to work. You're still going to do your thing, but you're going to have a different focus. You're going to be focused on teaching. You're going to be focused on other people. This is very second curve. This is where it all comes together. And this is what I try to do with my work. As I take Eastern or Western philosophy and wisdom, I mix it up with neuroscience with historical regularity and with modern experimental social science. And it all has to be consistent. If it's not all consistent, there's one part of that that's not quite right, then I'm under the wrong comprehensive story. So how this hangs together is you're passing into your second curve, which is also Vana Prastha as one of the ashramas retiring into the forest where you are the teacher. You are becoming less involved in your own success, but more involved in the success of other people. Now, that might carry you to great glory, but that's not primarily for that. If you're going to be in the happy, successful quadrant and here's the twist. There's another goal ahead of you, a big goal, which is the last order, the last ashrama, which is 75 and beyond, which is called sannyasa. Now a lot of people who studied Eastern philosophy or Hindu thought, they know what a sannyasi, a sannyasi is somebody who's an enlightened one. And in a lot of religious cults, they talk about sannyasi and all that. But basically all that means is somebody in this ashrama of sannyasa. And that is where you're really dedicated fully to spiritual enlightenment. And in ancient times, Hindu men of some means, and age 75 would take leave of their families and go to the Himalayas and sit at the foot of their master until death. Now I'm not suggesting that. That doesn't sound so great to me because I want to death do us part with my wife. But the whole point is once again, not that to take it literally. But rather to say, look, the fruit of my old age requires a lot of training, the intellectual and philosophical and spiritual transcendental root or fruit of my life requires this elite Training, which is vataprastha. You can't show up to the Olympics, 60 pounds overweight, expect to swim the backstroke, having not swum in months. It can't be done. You have to train for it. It takes according to the Hindu philosophers, 25 years of elite spiritual and intellectual and transcendental trained to get to that point later in life.
  Speaker 2
  Or if you go back in time to that plane ride from LA to DC, and let's just imagine you've somehow found yourself alone with this gentleman once you've figured out who he was and processed All he had to say, what would you say to him?
  Speaker 1
  Well, I wouldn't intrude on his privacy to begin with because I was overhearing a conversation about the most intimate things in his life with his wife, which is one of the reasons I haven't Divulged to a single soul and the identity of the man of the plane because it's not important. It could be anybody practically under very similar circumstances. But if you're asking me for particular advice, I would talk about the one thing that he's really missing, which he's evidently really missing. And by the way, I've have Googled him since then. I've been following him since then. He divorced that woman already, and it's not his first wife. And so the whole point is what he's been hungering after, panting after, lusting after is what he had in Gryhastha, what he had on his first curve, what he had in his idols of money, power, Pleasure, and honor. That's what he wanted. That's what he wants back. And the fruit of his life should be his enlightenment based on love, on faith and family and friendship and service to other people. Those are the habits, not the happiest people. Those are the people who are maximizing their happy span. I made up that word and it's awful, but I'm just trying to, you know, I'm talking to Peter and Tia here. I'm saying in the theme, that's what I would talk about is like you're going for the wrong thing. Your ambition to go back in time is going to lead you to misery. You need to move forward into the bonds of love that should be your rightfu... ([Time 1:26:43](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9a45318e-5921-4461-a218-c3a26b58cc58))

- Complexity Beyond Complication
  Summary:
  Addressing the challenges of human happiness often involves navigating complex problems rather than simply complicated ones.
  While issues such as sleep, exercise, and diet can be tackled with structured solutions, emotional and relational dilemmas, akin to the unpredictable behavior of cats, resist straightforward fixes. These complex problems, such as love and fulfillment, involve endless variables that defy engineering-type answers.
  Society often attempts to remedy these complexities with simplistic solutions, such as social media for loneliness, which ultimately fall short.
  The essence of human experience cannot be replicated like a reliable toaster; instead, it requires deeper engagement and understanding, revealing the inadequacies of easy solutions in the face of life's intricate and profound challenges.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Well, Arthur, I won't even ask if this gentleman is still alive, but if he is, I hope he's listening as I think we all are and I think we all benefit from this. It's a lot to think about. I think this is a harder thing to fix than a lot of the things that I talk about. I'm not sure why because you would think, well, gosh, it must be really hard to take somebody who's sleeping six hours a night in a fragmented way and help them get to eight hours a night Of great sleep or someone who's sitting on the couch all day and get them to exercise or someone who's living on McDonald's and get them eat happy. All of those things are difficult, but they're not as difficult. I think as taking somebody who lives on a hedonic treadmill and getting them to adjust that to decrease wants to make the type of strategic changes that are in keeping with what ultimately Will bring them happiness. I guess my final question for you is, well, first of all, I guess, do you agree with me, but assuming that you would agree that this is very difficult, why do you think it is?
  Speaker 1
  I've contemplated that enough a lot. I mean, I'll answer that actually in a weird way. When I was doing work for the Rand Corporation on combat modeling using huge computer systems to look at unbelievable number of simulations and contingencies. What I found was that all of the easiest problems to solve, which can be very hard, but they're solvable are what mathematicians call complicated problems. Those are problems that they take a lot of computational horsepower, but once you solve the problem, you can replicate the solution over and over again with great accuracy, like creating A jet engine where every single jet flies and almost none of them ever crash or fail. That's a complicated problem. Now, it took a long time to do that. That's what we call that the toaster problem. It wasn't that long ago that there were no toasters. I recommend that you don't try to build your own. You probably burn your house down, but now you can get a $20 toaster that lasts you for many, many years, and it makes really great toast. That's a complicated problem, but the bigger problems, the problems that really bedevil us, the problems of human life and the essence of human life are mostly complex problems. Those are the problems where we understand the nature of what winning means very easily, but there's so many inconceivably high number of permutations that they can't be solved. Those are not toaster problems. Those are cat problems. Cats are complex, not complicated. You know what they want, scratches and warmth and kibble and a box to poop in, but you don't know what they're going to do next ever. All of life's really interesting things that make life life. They're complex problems. Love is a complex problem. Love is a cat, not a toaster. The problem that we have in our life today, and the problem with what we're getting from tech, for example, is that they're trying to solve our complex problems of love using complicated Engineering solutions. You're lonely. Here's Facebook. That's like saying, you want a cat? Here's a toaster. So that's the problem, is that these complex issues, they're insoluble, actually. So we're looking for a simulacrum for a solution to these particular problems. And when it comes down to saying, just love more, it's insufficient. And that's why it's so hard. And so what I'll do when I can't get my cat is I'll just try to be contented with a toaster. It's like, I don't know, I can't find a mate. So I guess I'll buy a boat. I guess I'll try to be more successful. I guess I'll try to make more money. And it doesn't work. And that's what leads to a lot of the heartbreak of ordinary life.
  Speaker 2
  Arthur, I think that's literally one of the most remarkable explanations I've heard for. I mean, certainly I'm familiar with complex and complicated problems, but this application of it is probably one of the most helpful I've heard. So I appreciate that. ([Time 1:33:25](https://share.snipd.com/snip/58099995-b5ab-42b4-90a1-906b20f8ed7d))
    - **Note:** We’re looking for elegant solutions to complex problems which don’t exist. The harder we push the worse we do. Toaster vs a cat.
