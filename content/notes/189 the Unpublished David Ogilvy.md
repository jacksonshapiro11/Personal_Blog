  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  One, at 25, i was brilliantly clever.
  Speaker 1
  And two, i have learned nothing new in subsequent 27 years.
  Speaker 2
  And so just a few higlets from this very short memo, every ad must tell the wholesale story.
  Speaker 1
  The copy must be human and very simple. Every word in the copy must count. Concrete figures must be substitute for atmospheric claims. Cliches must give way to facts and and empty exhortations to alluring offers.
  Speaker 2
  And this is not written, this memm is not written like a list form, but it is to me. It's like almost like every paragraphs coundi like a maxim. So they do. It doesn't flow like he's not writing a narrative here. So the very next paragraph, he says, permanent success has rarely been built on frivolity.
  Speaker 1
  And that people do not from clowns. Superlatives have no place in a serious advertisement.
  Speaker 2
  So david drops out of oxford, and he never winds up getting his college degree.
  Speaker 1
  And he winds up, he has a series of jobs. One he's working in for a very strict chef am in paris.
  Speaker 2
  And he gets recruited out of that kitchen to be a dorto door salesman for the thing called the aga cooker.
  Speaker 1
  So he winds up writing, after having some experience trying to sell this sing dordidor, he writes this thing called the theory and practice of selling the aga cooker, a guide to his fellow doridor salesmen. ([Time 0:05:28](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ce47b705-6b57-4a64-8986-e06bccf7f6a0))

- Salesmanship Tips: Opposite of Competitors & Appealing to Interest
  Key takeaways:
  - Study the methods of competitors and do the opposite
  - Avoid being boring as a salesman
  - Salesmanship involves energy, time, and knowledge of the product
  - Appeal to the interests of the person being sold to
  - Do not go above the head of the person being sold to before or after the sale
  - The cook in the household can be a powerful ally or enemy in sales
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  In general, study the methods of your competitors and do the exact opposite. The worst fault a salesman can commit is to be a bore.
  Speaker 2
  So he is writing that when he's 24. This book ends with an absolutely fantastic interview. Ah, when david is 75 years old, and he's still talking about that 50 years later.
  Speaker 1
  Quality of salesmanship involves energy, time and knowledge of the product.
  Speaker 2
  And this next paragraph, he's gust going to tell us, naturally, you have to appeal to the interest. Appeal to the interest of the person you're selling to. If there is a cook in the house, she's bound to have the casting vote over a new cooker. Butter her up.
  Speaker 1
  Never go above her head before the sale. And afterwards, as a user of your product, a cook be your bitterest enemy or your best friend. She can poison a whole district, or act as your secret representative. The aga will mean for her. And this is the interest, this is why you start with her.
  Speaker 2
  And she helps convince the person. He's seltling it door to door in like a very, a, like a fluent area, so allow these people have staff and cooks and everything else. And so he says, and this is why he starts with cook as he's appealing directly to interest. The aga will mean for her an extra hour in bed and a kitchen as clean as a drawing room.
  Speaker 1
  Two more bits of advice from this, use social proof, and then avoid mentioning your competitors. ([Time 0:07:35](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0ed268b6-7725-46e3-868d-de941a12e41f))
    - **Note:** Appeal to the customers.
- Effective Sales Techniques and Communication Strategies
  Key takeaways:
  - Mention satisfied owners to make the prospect familiar
  - Avoid discussing competitors to maintain a positive atmosphere
  - Do not speak ill about competitors as it can make the prospect distrust you
  - David A is an effective communicator because he speaks in maxims
  - He reduces ideas down to something memorable
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Esays, do you know so and so who just put in an aga, go on mentioning all the satisfied owners until you find someone whose name is familiar to the prospect. Try to avoid being drawn into discussing competitors, as it introduces a negative and defensive atmosphere.
  Speaker 2
  On no account sling mud, it can carry very little weight coming from you, it can carry very, very little weight coming from you, obviously, becauseyou're tring to sell themud competing product.
  Speaker 1
  And it will make the prospect distrust your integrity and dislike you. Ocorseo, now we get to the section of the book where it's all notes, memos, letters, allotted.
  Speaker 2
  This is internal company communication, which is really, really fascinating.
  Speaker 1
  And one thing that makes david a such a effective communicator is the fact that he speaks in maxims. He's very pithy, but he also repeats himself over and over again.
  Speaker 2
  And it's because he's, and i don't consider this overly reductive any means. He takes it, like an idea, and reduces it down to something that you can remember and carry with you in it's memorable in the way he talks a like. One example would be the importance of paying for talent. He'll say, instead of saying, you know, paya, you know, people are extremely talented or not going to work for a like they're expensive. You have to pay them, he won't say that. He'll say, pay peanuts and you get monkeys. When he to tell you about the importance of researching the great work that came before you and making sure that youre you hve extensive product knowledge, and then comparing those people that that don't do this other people in his field, he'll say, a blind pig can sometimes find truffles, but it helps to know that they're found in oak forests. ([Time 0:09:07](https://share.snipd.com/snip/52576cc6-ce98-471b-9ee2-5f6c141a8375))
    - **Note:** Speak in Maximus and repeat yourself. Knows the customer well and pleases them.
- Ogivy and Mather: The Ad World's Teaching Hospital
  Key takeaways:
  - Best founders are teachers
  - Great companies teach and look after clients
  - Ogovi and Mather is the teaching hospital of advertising
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Ah, thit's another memo which i love, because all the best founders, when, when you read all these biographies, you realize all the best founders are teachers. One of my favorite m quotes about this is from sole price, who i consider the most influential retailer of all time. His ideas have been used by people like the founder of cosco, jim sinogal, sam walton, jeff basos, that that founded home depot, on and on am. But he said something thatwasthatwas fantastic. He sais you train an animal, you teach a person. And so ogavy's using a metaphor about what he wants is his, his business to be, his companyd be.
  Speaker 1
  And so he's writing this memo to the board of directors a teaching hospital, is the title of this. I have a new metaphor. Great hospitals do two things, they look after patients and they teach young doctors. Ogovy and mather does two things, we look after clients and we teach young advertising people. Ogovi and mather is the teaching hospital of the advertising world. And as such, to be respected above it is to be respected above all other agencies.
  Speaker 2
  And then he ends the memo, and he repeats himself over in orn about the traits that he wants. He was, he said, at the time there was no such thing as company, company culture. He's like, i called it philosophy. What i called philosophy then is now referredto has company culture. But he's constantly trying to make the culture he wants very explicit. ([Time 0:11:22](https://share.snipd.com/snip/544cd905-52c4-4402-9803-4a1fb0e9f325))
    - **Note:** Hire people with brains. Train an animal teach a person. payvpeanuts get monkeys. No statues of committees. Make the culture explicit
- The Value of Brevity in Communication
  Key takeaways:
  - Ogaby learned the value of brevity in communication.
  - Getting to the point quickly makes communication more memorable.
  - A tweet-sized memo can be attention-grabbing and effective.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  And so you would write this guy, ogaby would send him communication, and if i remember correctly, you would get one of three responses back from he would just write on top of the paper you gave him, yes, no, or question mark. And question mark meant come to see him. And so ogaby took om tha lesson the value of brevity, of getting to your point extremely fast. And so this is a very, like a tweet sized memo that he's sending a joel, who he's working with. But even in a tweat sized memmo, he knows like, you get their attention, you make it memorable.
  Speaker 1
  He says, joel, i thought you promised to show me the seers as last, the sears ads last tuesday. It has been three months since struthers picked them, longer than the period of station in pigs.
  Speaker 2
  So joel probably gets, i mean, obviously youre so going to pay attention if you get a memo from your boss. But joel prary gets a lot of inner office communication, right? It's the hay, where's that seers add? Let me see it.
  Speaker 1
  That's one way to communicate it, when you say, hey, let me see that seers ad.
  Speaker 2
  They've been with others agency for longer than it takes a pig to gestate like thatss, just such an odd thing to appear in a memmo.
  Speaker 1
  It's going to, it will make, it will definitely grab your tention.
  Speaker 2
  Ill definly make it memorable. He's writing, there's another example of this. And this is something that somebody did to him that made it's a job apblication.
  Speaker 1
  Hundreds of millions. Who knows how many job ablications have ever been written. How many of them do you actually remember? So this is a letter to ray taylor, who used to work for ogovy and mather as a copywriter. He wind up retiring many years later from another agency.
  Speaker 2
  And david takes the time to t him a letter, and it's because ray made himself memorable. ([Time 0:15:07](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9c96f9a1-30d0-4020-a8c6-8594edffef88))
    - **Note:** Clear short communication. Being proactive about problems of you hear something discussed in a meeting leave the meeting and get it.
- Writing an Obituary While They're Still Alive - Traits We Admire
  Key takeaways:
  - Tellex is the normal medium for inter office communication
  - Messages are usually not urgent
  - The author finds extravagance aesthetically repulsive
  - The author admires shyness and kindness in others
  - The author intends to write a glowing obituary for a copywriter they respect
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I have the impress that tellex has become the normal medium for inter office communication. The vast majority of messages i see are not urgent in any way.
  Speaker 2
  And he wraps up this memo, i find extravagance aesthetically repulsive.
  Speaker 1
  I find the new england puritan tradition more attractive and more profitable.
  Speaker 2
  So now he's writing another memo to a copywriter that he respects. And the note is left myself as wriht, an obituary where they are still alive. And so he's writing this guise obituary. And really what was happening, and he's oesy, still alive, was happening is he's telling us the traits that he admires in other people. Right? A shyness makes it impossible for me to tell any man what i think of him when he's still alive.
  Speaker 1
  However, if i outlive you, i shall write an obituary along these lines, says, he was probably the nicest man i have ever known. His kindness to me dozens of other people was nothing short of angelic. Many nice men are too dumb to be anything else. But he was far from dumb. Indeed. He had a superb intelligence. His judgment of men in events was infaluable. I came to rely on it more and more as the years went by. He was one of my few partners who worked harder and longer hours than i did. He gave value for money, and he knew is trade. ([Time 0:17:54](https://share.snipd.com/snip/bde4045b-527c-4f05-b012-90a96b118b01))
    - **Note:** Control costs. To the point. Tell your big idea and quickly and memorably.
- David Ogilvy's Lasting Career: Lessons Learned
  Key takeaways:
  - David Ogilvy outlived all his competitors
  - His passion for advertising never waned
  - Younger partners tolerated his presence
  - David gave his partners a free run, which allowed Ogilvy and Mather to outgrow its founder
  - David's hobbies are rather narrow
  - He spends several hours a day in his garden and at his desk and reads mostly biography
  - David's approach to writing copy is fascinating and similar to other writers
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  One more sentence i pulled out when he is talking about his own book, ogivi and advertising, i wrote what i really believe my last will and testament, a list that he responds to a journalist who is writing a book on lengthy careers, asking david how he had lasted so long. Number one, i have outlived all my competitors.
  Speaker 1
  Number two, my obcessive interest in advertising has not dimmed. Number three, my younger partners have tolerated my presence in their midst number four, i had the wisdom to give them a free run. As a result, ogoviand mather has outgrown its founder.
  Speaker 2
  Another memo in the hobbies, hes talke about all the things he can't do, and his interests really are rather narrow.
  Speaker 1
  Says, i spend several hours a day working in my garden, and several hours a day at my desk.
  Speaker 2
  And i read a great deal, mostly biography. I'm gong t actually read the whole, the entire next memo, because i think it's fastening its on he's writing a memo and how he writes copy. So this sounds like a lot of writers, if you'll you hear them give talks or even write about the act of their craft of actually writing.
  Speaker 1
  A lot of em say that they hate the act of writing, but they like having written.
  Speaker 2
  So there's kind of that theme that sin just this memore or this letter that olgmeis outlining, he's gotn to outline.
  Speaker 1
  What is i 12? ([Time 0:22:22](https://share.snipd.com/snip/15e409cf-c0ae-4fc0-bb9e-66969bfa6c70))

- Entrepreneurship: Studying precedents and doing thorough research
  Key takeaways:
  - Studying precedents sets successful people apart
  - Most people go after the easiest things
  - Investing time in research and reading reports leads to success
  - Writing out a definition of the problem is a helpful step
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Number two, i spend a long time studying the precedents. I look at everythis as thist sets him apart, because so few people are willing to do this everby talks about there's so much competition when your starting businesses or or doing anything difficult, is like, there's not competition at the vert. There's very few competition at the very top, because most people go after the easiest things. Lick, listen to this. He hasn't even started writing his ad yet, and he says, i spend a long time studying the precedents. I look at every advertisement which has appeared for competing products during the last durng, the last 20 years. That echoes what buffet was talking about in one of his books, where he's like, if you wanted, before making an investment, thinking of making investment a company, nowed you read every single report that they produce, but you aut to receder, read every single other report that every other company in the same industry produces. How many people are willing to do that? Number three, i am help without research material. And the more motivation all the better. Number four, i write out a definition of the problem and a statement of the purpose which i wish the campaign to achieve. Then i go no further until the statement and its principles have been accepted by the client. Number five, before writing, before actually writing the copy, i write down every conceivable fact and selling idea. Then i get themgan and relate them to research and the copy platform. Number six, then i write the headline. As a matter of fact, i write 20 alternative headlines for every ad. And i never select the final headline without asking the opinions of other people in the agency. ([Time 0:24:09](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d56a3fc6-4da6-42f6-993f-888cac68ed3f))

  Key takeaways:
  - The speaker is a copywriter who takes the train to NY and edits their own drafts.
  - They get angry if the client changes the copy.
  - The speaker lists 12 of their shortcomings, including intolerance of mediocrity and funking firing people.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Number 11, i take the train to new york, and my secretary types a draft.
  Speaker 2
  Number 12, i am a lousy copy copywriter, but i am a good editor. So i go to work editing my own draft.
  Speaker 1
  After four or five editings, it looks good enough to show to the client. If the client changes the copy, i get angry, because i took a lot of trouble writing it, and what i wrote i wrote on purpose. Altogether, it is a slow and laborious business. I understand that some copy writers have much greater facility.
  Speaker 2
  So he gets a letter asking for a response of what his greatest, his worst shortcomings were. And so he just sends his guy back a list of t list of 12 of his shortcomings.
  Speaker 1
  Number one, i am intolerant of mediocrity and laziness. Number two, i fritter away too much time on things which aren't important. Number three, like everyone of my age, i talk too much of the past. Number four, i have always funked firing people who needed be fired. Number five, i am afraid of flying, and i go to ridiculous lengths to avoid it. Number six, when i was the creative head in new york, i wrote too much of the advertising myself.
  Speaker 2
  Number seven, i know nothing about finance. Number eight, i change my mind about advertising and about people. ([Time 0:26:29](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a05e9151-58bf-45fa-a312-854fce230434))

- The Importance of a Sharply Defined Brand Personality
  Key takeaways:
  - Manufacturers are reluctant to accept limitations on their brand
  - Being all things to all people creates a brand with no personality
  - Building a sharply defined personality is the key to long-term market success
  - Stick to one coherent creative policy year after year
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And so he writes, i find that most manufacturers are reluctant to accept any such limitation on the image and personality of their brands. They want to be all things to all people. And in their greed, they almost always end up with a brand that has no personality of any kind, a wishy water a wishy, washy, neutered brand. What would you think of a politician who changed his public personality every year? Have you noticed that winston churchill has been careful to wear the same time ties and same hats for 50 years so as not to confuse us? What guts it takes, what obstinate determination to stick to one coherent creative policy year after year, in the face of all the pressures to come up with something new for every six months. The manufacturer who dedicates his advertising to building the most favorable image, the most sharply defined personality, is the one who will get the largest share of the market at the highest profit in the long run. We try to create sharply defined personalities for our brands, and we stick to those personalities year after year. Thanks for listening to this preview.
