### Highlights

- The Impact of Vehicle Cost to Launch Payload in Space Exploration
  Key takeaways:
  - The cost to get 100 tons into orbit is $2 million, which is a step function change compared to the variable cost of $15 million for lifting 17 metric tons to orbit with Falcon 9.
  - 100 metric tons is a conservative estimate, and the new method is a roughly 50X change compared to before.
  - This new method massively changes unit economics for Starlink and for sending anything into orbit.
  - Overall, this new method is great for SpaceX, America, and everyone, including humanity.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  The back of the envelope $2 million is the cost to get 100 tons into orbit. That's the metric variable cost variable cost.
  Speaker 4
  So I think the point Gavin is making it if I might just put it at is that it is a step function change.
  Speaker 1
  It's not like a small change. It's an enormous change. Right. Can you compare that to the numbers before for folks to understand?
  Speaker 5
  The Falcon 9 mass to useful orbit is 17 metric tons. And the variable cost that, you know, I have seen Elon tweet about is somewhere around $15 million. So you are lifting more than five times the mass to orbit. And based on other statements, 100 metric tons is a very conservative estimate. And you are doing it, I'd call it 10 to 15% of the cost. So this is a, you know, we can all do the math, but we can envelope it roughly a 50 X. Huge change. And this massively changes unit economics for Starlink for sending anything into orbit. And as Antonio said, it's great for SpaceX, it's great for America. And it's great for everyone. It's great for humanity.
  Speaker 1
  Can you explain how that then translates into going to Mars? So now we can get 100 tons into orbit for $2 million. What happens next in terms of like how that payload capacity and low cost enables, you know, full transport to Mars. And you know, I know that the timelines are tough, but it would be super helpful to just to translate the orbit concept into the let's go to Mars concept.
  Speaker 4
  It's important to know that like the size of this thing, get the sense of scale is the interior space of it is the size of the International Space Station. So it's a huge amount of tonnage. Just think about all that it's going to take to get to Mars, right? ([Time 0:04:56](https://share.snipd.com/snip/97ca04b8-5181-48dc-b731-08878a604143))
    - **Note:** 50x cost decrease in space transportation.
