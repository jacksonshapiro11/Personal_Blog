  Listening is something a few people have told me that you're extraordinarily good at. I suspect that's because you listen below the surface and to the meaning and not just the words. How would you teach your kids to become better listeners? How do you teach adults to become better listeners?
  Speaker 1
  I've never had anybody ask me exactly that question before Shane. I guess the first thing I would say is that listening tends to be contagious. So how each of us listens does tend to wear off on other people. So I noticed, again, with my children, that when I listen, what we call, I have a call listening to when, which is to just make them wrong, or like when I say, well, that's not true. You look great. Or don't worry about that. You know, you'll be fine. It might feel good to me in the moment, but it's not kind of, they don't feel heard. But that mind that when people feel really, really, truly seen and heard, it's one of the most extraordinary experiences that a person can have. And so just being around that and having the experience of being on the receiving end of that sort of deep listening where you feel truly seen and fully seen is itself a condition for learning to listen. Well, on the other end of the spectrum, there are very particular techniques that help people listen. Well, for me, the most important one has been really the training and understanding of adult development theory, particularly the one that my colleagues and I are most have most depth in, which is the subject object theory that it was developed by Bob Keegan and others. And in the subject object theory, you're what you're listening for the stage of development is defined by what is subject and what is object. And when I say subject, what I mean is like what you're fused with. It's like the water you're swimming in, the lens through which you see things, but you don't actually even know you have a lens. And what is object is what can be held out and examined and talked about like a value is object if you can see how it's shaping what you do and don't do a value is subject if it's invisibly shaping what you do and don't do, for example. So in this subject, this growth edge coach training that several of my colleagues and I run, what we're teaching coaches to do is to listen for what is subject and what is object. In listening in that way, you have to be listening below the surface of the story. And every time you hear a word or phrase wondering, hmm, I wonder what that person means by that. And so it's amping up curiosity. It's really, really foregrounding the fact that we each of us never really knows what another person means. And so we can only be curious to find out.

    - **Note:** Listening deeply so people feel genuinely heard not listening to win. What is subject is the tangible thing being discussed and what is object is the unsaid truths that are tied to a conversation. The bias inherent in models.
