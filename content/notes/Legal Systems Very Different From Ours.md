### Highlights

- The Legalists, who believed in using the rational self-interest of those subject to law to make them behave in the way desired by those making the law, were accused by later writers of advocating harsh penalties to drive the crime rate to near zero.2 They supported a strong central government and equal treatment under law. Confucianists argued for modifying behavior not by reward and punishment but by teaching virtue. They supported unequal treatment based both on the unequal status of those to whom the law applied and on their differing relationships.

    - **Note:** Legalist believed in punishment and reform while confucionists wanted to teach virtue. Laws were also class based.
- The disagreement between Legalists and Confucianists to some degree resembles the conflict between 18th and 19th century British approaches to crime and punishment. The dominant view in the eighteenth century saw criminal penalties as deterrence, their purpose to make crime unprofitable. The dominant view in the nineteenth century saw criminals as victims of their own ignorance and irrationality, the purpose of penalties to reform them, make them wiser and better. That view was reflected in terms such as “reformatory” and “penitentiary” and associated practices. Both approaches survive in modern legal theory and modern legal systems.

- One can argue that the existence of such rules makes the Amish more modern than the rest of us, not less, since they are making deliberate decisions about what modern technologies do or do not fit into their social structure.

- Two weeks before, each is asked “whether he is in agreement with the Ordnung, whether he is at peace with the brotherhood, and whether anything ‘stands in the way’ of his entering into the communion service.” ([Location 781](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MTPZVX9&location=781))
- Communion does not take place until all members agree. This gives the members an opportunity to openly express disagreement with the current ordnung—but, as a rule, the members accept the clergy leaders’ position.

- Competitive dictatorship is the mechanism we routinely use to control hotels and restaurants; the customers have no vote on what color the walls are painted or what is on the menu but an absolute vote on which one they patronize.

- The eventual solution was to do both. Joseph Caro wrote one volume, the Bet Yosef, that provided multiple arguments from different authorities and a second and shorter volume, the Shulhan Arukh, the “Set Table,” that gave only the conclusions.149 A judge could look up the answer to any legal problem in the Shulhan Arukh and, if unhappy with it, go to the Bet Yosef to see the variant opinions of other authorities.

- The result of these developments was a legal system based in theory on Torah but in fact largely on rabbinic interpretations of Torah, many of them far from the literal meaning of the text,164 and rabbinic legislation, some of it in direct violation of the text.165 ([Location 1134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MTPZVX9&location=1134))
- What I find interesting about this solution, other than its ingenuity and somewhat dubious logic, is the reluctance of the communal authorities who offered it to follow through in practice on their legal theory.

- A legal doctrine that gave the daughter the right to sue would make the daughter’s tactic less risky by making it possible for her to punish a seducer who refused to marry her. A legal doctrine that gave the father control over the action gave him a threat that could be used to discourage unacceptable suitors.180 ([Location 1253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MTPZVX9&location=1253))

- The court is not sure the defendant owes more than a quarter, so will not force him to pay more than a quarter.
