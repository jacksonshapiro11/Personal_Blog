  Speaker 1
  And this again, this gives you the idea. I was texting a friend about this book yesterday. When I was saying is like, the book is 40 years old. This guy, I don't think he ever finished high school. He had a middle school and eighth grade education, yet he's a business genius. He winds up building a multi-billion dollar company selling tires. And there's no way you could look at his childhood and predict that outcome. But you could look at his childhood and the way he approached everything is like, this guy's going to succeed at whatever he does. Maybe not to the degree of making, you know, a multi-billion dollar company, but he was not going to end up a loser like his dad. So he says, I immediately started to deliver newspapers. I remember my so well, my first route. I didn't know how to ride a bike. We never had one. So all the other young kids delivering newspapers on a bike, right? He's got no money. Doesn't know how to ride one. I ran my route for two months in order to get enough money to buy my first used bike. I'd run nine or 10 miles a day. I was too proud to complain. That is the second time that something he says over and over again, the fact that he had a lot, he was poor. He knew he knew he was raised in poverty, but he was very proud person, a very cocky person. And I think he used his pride and his cockiness as fuel. And I actually think it served him. So now in the story, he's 15 years old. January, 1933, our mother became ill and she was in the hospital. She died 10 days later from pneumonia, but as much as anything from complete exhaustion. ([Time 0:07:33](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2b8a05f2-1dee-409c-8d19-5383d5e04fdc))
    - **Note:** He grew up poor in a logging camp with no running water. He never finished high school but created a great business with amazing incentives. His dad was a drunk and his mom died when he was young as a result of his dads habits and exhaustion. Les would go into town for the week for school and he would deliver papers to make money he was too proud and didn’t have a bike so he ran his route 9 miles a day until he could afford a bike. Working really hard dad dies at 16. He’s delivering newspapers during the depression doing every route in town making more than his high school principal never graduated high school extreme grit.

  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Ton of money for his day. I attempted to put some pride into the circulation work for myself and for others. I was young. I was cocky. But the same cockiness helped me a lot in going through life. Fast forward 10 years is a very common situation. I was now 28 years old. I had ambition. I wanted to go into business as I'd always wanted to be a businessman, but I didn't have any money. I was going through a period at this point of not knowing just what I wanted to do. Five years later, still working the newspaper business. I was 33 years old now and I still wanted to go into business for my own. Money was the main thing holding me up. My brother-in-law told me to find a business and he'd help me finance it. That was all I needed. And I started to look seriously as I knew time was running out. I believed if you didn't get started in business at a fairly young age, you would get into a rut and never make the big decision to jump. And this is so wild. He picks an industry way to get to this. He picks an industry we had no experience. He's like, all right, well, there's this like little tire shop. They're all franchises at this point. So it's called OK, rubber welders. It's a franchisee of OK, rubber welders. And he's like, all right, I thought the tire business had a future. I remember telling my wife, I thought I was a salesman and a pretty good one. And maybe that ability could be used in the tire business. This small shop retread tires sold new tires and fixed flats. It was hard knuckle busting dirty work. ([Time 0:13:02](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2dcedb05-a00c-4495-8bbd-b0feb85cf95c))
    - **Note:** You can know more about your area than anyone else. You don’t need to be smarter. Les was a great salesperson and knew incentives and how to sell he always wanted to go out on his own and at 33 he finally realized his time was up and it was now or never. Incrntivrs rule everything. He risks everything his life insurance his house to borrow 17k to start his shop in 1952. Burn the boats. When people franchise shops Les needed to incentivize them so he gave his workers 50% of the profits strong system. Tires were run by an OEM cabal but Les rode the wave of Japanese tires where he can get a better pricing less capture. Never take advantage of a customer and employee. The tires companies fucked him so he found the Japanese problems are opportunities in work clothes. He 5xed the sales of his tire company the first year from the guy he bought it from by being a great salesperson. He opens up his second store and gets the profit sharing incentives right or else it would’ve failed.

  Speaker 1
  And I'm telling you, it's very it's it's impossible to read this book and not love less as a person. And he's like, no, I'm going to be independent and I'm going to fight because I don't think what you guys are doing. I write. And he also has he was really Charlie's going to talk about this later, but he thought he was an artist. He was really gifted with marketing and advertising as well. So he goes to the franchise company. And he's like, hey, I'm going to open an independent tire store and the guy goes, you can't do that and Les goes. Let's not argue. I just want to be open about it. And so he's like, you can't do this. I'm just going to do this anyways. I'm not here for discussion. I'm just letting you know because I thought it'd be the right thing to do. And so he's like, all right, now I got to figure out a new name. And he's like, maybe I'll just call this a tire center. And then he goes, but that seems to plain. And then he goes, well, what if I just call it less Schwab tire center? I'll just name it after myself. And that's exactly what he does. And so then he's like, I know I have a fight. So we're just going to have to like we're just going to have to fight about this. Yeah, I really did have a fight now with OK. They were threatening to take all my equipment away from me and cancel me as a franchise member. And this is his response when they told him that I lost my temper. And I told them here after I didn't want any more harassment from them. If they had anything more to say, say it in court, I walked the floor nights. OK, this is a very important term that he uses over and over again. ([Time 0:22:45](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0b79ce24-27a5-4239-93a4-db64e575575b))
    - **Note:** He’s working at a franchise of ok tires but decides he wanted to own his brand so he told the ok tire folks that’s what he was doing they pushed back and he said that it was happening and to move on or fight him in court. Fanaticism and scale combinded leads to business success when he was on the road he’d go to other tire shops. He is basically living on the edge early could’ve gone bankrupt at any time. His entire net worth was in this. Shopping his competitors has a heart attack from all the stress but keeps going. Combined lolapolza of incentives riding the wave of technology and just default aggressive in expansion. Business genius always had his leases with escape clause and option to pay to keep all options in mind.

  - The speaker suggested using a combination of walnut and sawdust in the rubber, which led to a successful advertising campaign and increased demand for the tires.

  - The speaker emphasizes the value of good ideas and compares them to magic.
  - The person in the transcript has ample time to think about their business, similar to Sam.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And I noticed that he used a measuring shovel to add the walnut shells and sawdust. So you could buy either rubber mixed with walnut or rubber mixed with sawdust. The uses in like sleet and snow and icy conditions, right? They had two shovelfuls to each batch of rubber while mixing. Since we had such a hard time deciding which one was best, Walmart or sawdust, I asked them, could you put one shovel of walnut and one shovel of sawdust? They said, yes, I told them to make all of my tires that way unless I told them differently. Then I went home and I started a big advertising campaign. The new rubber, especially designed for the Leschwab company, walnut for ice, sawdust for snow. Many people brought in their old tires and asked us to redo their tires because the new rubber sounded so good. And they wanted that. We use this campaign and this rubber for years and years and years. The power of one idea is the fact that it's can be valuable and long lasting for years and years and years. And it took him just going to visit and paying attention. And then one idea pops to his mind and he winds up using that throughout his company, multiple stores for years. Ideas, a great ideas are like magic. And he's got a lot of time to think about his business because just like Sam ([Time 0:32:02](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e7325c72-e125-42b5-88ba-b345eb790a40))
    - **Note:** Great ideas are like magic they last years. He sees from the front how tires are made and comes up with a walnut sawdust blend and markets this proprietary blend and this becomes his calling bars for years. “Sawdust for ice walnut for snow”. This was his marketing message what is normal to you is extraordinary to your customers. He stole the marketing message from lucky strike and repurposed it for his company. Stealing others ideas. He would also replace spares for free because he knew that would drive future business due to reciprocity. He turned showrooms into the warehouse and people saw the entire inventory and cleaned them every day. Super market tire store completely counter positioned to what other tire stores were doing.
- Inspirational Quotes from Successful Businessmen
  Key takeaways:
  - There is no problem that can't be solved if you know your business from A to Z.
  - All of the more than 250 managers and assistant managers at the company started at the bottom and worked their way up.
  - Focus and avoid complacency to prevent the company from declining.
  - Complacency can lead to downfall and it is difficult to recover from it.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  It reminds me of one of my favorite quotes from Sam Zemuri, the banana king. That said, there's no problem you can't solve if you know your business from A to Z. So actually, I'm going to pause where I'm at in this sentence and read something that Les says later on. In our 34 years of business, we have never hired a manager from the outside, nor have we ever hired an assistant manager directly to do that job. Every single one of our more than 250 managers and assistant managers started at the bottom changing tires. They have all earned their manager jobs where working up and they also understand every single part of the business because they did every single part of the business. Another way he reminds me of Sam Walton, Sam Walton had this great line in his autobiography when people asked like how he built Walmart. He says, we just got after it and then we stayed after it. Les Swab would say that once you get on the ball, he uses that word all the time, like you've got to be on the ball, that you stay on the ball. And so a directive that he gives to all of his employees that's reprinted in the book is the fact that you have to focus and you have to avoid complacency. If we think there's a free lunch, if we rely on last year's results, then this company will turn a corner and then we too will start to go downhill. And once you start down, it is mighty hard to turn around. If we become complacent, then brother, it's all over with. ([Time 0:39:28](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5734b9af-1eb2-494a-a865-40770b2c7232))
    - **Note:** Get after it and stay after it never get complacent. He realizes and communicates that people care about themselves and we needed to give them the ability to grow and make money with us. He only promoted from within for manager so people both knew the business were getting promise properly motivated. The large rubber companies had bad incentives and had a talent drain was medicine. He went independent because usually people aligned with a tire manucaterer like good year but these were abusive so he was the first to try it on his own. Profit sharing being unselfish food good reasons. He had no theft because he cultivated ownership and people were stealing from themselves. His partners wanted out and so he decided to buy them out they wanted money didn’t think long term he paid 300k for their stakes 15 years later their bonus would’ve been millions. Money hungry and short term thinking. Money and founder conflict is nuts people lose sight of what’s important. Henry firds partner pushed to get his 175k out of the business 10 years later it was worth 100mm. Blinded by money. It would be worth hundred of millions if they held.
- Lessons from Biographies and Autobiographies of Founders
  Key takeaways:
  - They sold their interest in the company for $225,000, missing out on potential wealth
  - Biographies can provide valuable lessons and make connections between different stories
  - Sam Walton and Les Schwab share similar perspectives on the importance of serving customers and prioritizing store operations
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  They could have still been alive and have 20% of that company. And instead they sold it for two, their interest for $225,000. So they could buy a swimming pool. Incredible. This is why I love biographies. There's just so many lessons and you can like that. Hopefully I hit you in the head or excuse me, hit you in the heart. But you know, that takes place over like, you know, three, four pages. It's just absolutely incredible. And then it just makes you think of all the other biographies and maybe other episodes of founders that you've listened to, you can kind of tie it all together and it really, I think, makes It resonate much more than just a list of facts. Now, another example, I hate to keep doing this, but I'm telling you, man, Sam Walton and Les Schwab are very similar people. So Sam Walton is autobiography says, if you are not serving the customer or supporting the folks who do, we do not need you. This dude less is constantly railing against office people, even though he's an office person. He's like the store people are the only ones that are important. We have had over the years, some people in the office to sometimes think that they are more important than the stores. The office serves only one purpose and that is to serve the stores. The office and accounting people can only tell the stores what they have done. If the store manager runs his store right, he doesn't have to spend hours and hours looking at the office reports. If he's doing okay, the records will show it. In fact, if he spends too much time in his office reading the mail or looking at reports, it is a sure thing that his store will suffer. ([Time 0:56:00](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0859b113-8edf-49a1-8fad-07a5038f4471))
    - **Note:** Hates office people just wanted people to sell tires. He drives 600 miles a day just visiting stores. Store managers make more than office managers. Valued the boots on the ground. Skills atrophy you need to live and breathe your business. He thought he would pay the highest wages possible because pay penuts get monkeys. His competition tries to underpay his workers but Les thinks about it and sticks to his values. Life is hard for those who take short cuts. Successful businesses are driven by the love of the game not the money. Prioritized the people on the front lines and everything takes care of itself. Life is hard just toughen up. Keep decision making at the lowest possible level believe in and empower people. Keep the main thing the main thing focus on what’s in front of you and constant steady. Anything worth doing is worth doing to excess. Constant growth.
