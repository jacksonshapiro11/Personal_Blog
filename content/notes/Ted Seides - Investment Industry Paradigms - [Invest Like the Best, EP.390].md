  Speaker 1
  In our events, I define precisely what it means to be an asshole. Fortunately, we've never advertised it. It's a little bit on our website, but it's already an excess demand situation. People actually come to me like, okay, I'm not going to be an asshole. What's the definition? You got to tell us? Definition is you do not take out your cell phone when you're in one of these small group discussions. And if you do, we're not telling you you're a prisoner for the next hour, just go walk away from the group and go on your cell phone. So you figure out things only way, but I take notes on my cell phone. So we're like, okay, you do that. And then I noticed, if you're swiping left and right, it means you're single. And if you're swiping up and down, it means you're like on Instagram or Twitter, but neither one of those things is taking notes. So that's one. In these small groups, you really try to bounce out introverts and extroverts. If someone's truly dominating the discussion and not looking at others, that's considered an asshole. One conversation happening at a time. The person who diverts on the side conversation and won't stop, that's called being an asshole. That's about it. You're not trying to say, you better be polite. I mean, it's just, there are a couple of things that show respect for each other and that you would never do if you were trying to engage with those other people around you.
