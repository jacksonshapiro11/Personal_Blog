- Importance of Clear Directions and Quality Team in Politics
  Summary:
  Clear directions and moving people efficiently are crucial in politics.
  Unlike running a company, political leadership requires managing various interests and putting the right people in key positions. The key is to have a core team of strong, determined individuals who share the leader's vision.
  Policies in politics demand intellectual depth to translate ambitions into actionable strategies.
  Many leaders fail to bring about change because they focus on ambitions rather than concrete policies.
  Crafting effective policies, especially in transformative times like the AI revolution, is challenging but essential for real change in a country.

  Speaker 1
  Well, in terms of running the system, yes, definitely with the benefit of experience, I would have given much clearer directions. I would have moved people much faster. I would have probably done, because in politics, again, this is where it's different from running a company. In a company by and large, you can put the people in the places you want them. Except in exceptional circumstances, I think this is true, except in exceptional circumstances, if you're running a company, you've got no one in the senior management who you don't Want to be in the senior management. Policies isn't like that because you've got elements, political elements you may have to pacify. There may be people that you don't particularly want because they're not particularly good at being ministers, but they may be very good at managing your party or your government in Order to get things through. What I learned over time is the important thing is to put in the core positions that really matter to you, you can't, don't fall short on quality. And it's something, it's one of the really interesting things, because I think being a political leader is the same as leading a company or a community center or a football team. It all comes to the same thing, but you realize it's such an obvious thing to say that it's all about the but it's all about the people. If you get really good, strong, determined people who are prepared to share your vision and are prepared to get behind and really push, then you don't need that many of them, actually,
  Speaker 2
  To change your country, but they do need to be there. That's really interesting. So when I think about, this is not particular even to the UK, but even in Western governments, people are often frustrated that they elect somebody they think is a change maker. Things don't necessarily change that much. The system feels an inertia. If this is the case, is it because they didn't have the right team around them? Because if you think of, I don't know, Obama or Trump or Biden, at the very top, I assume they can recruit like top people to the extent that they weren't able to exact the change they wanted. Is it because, well, you know, must not have been because they didn't get the right chief of staff, right? They can probably get the right chief of staff.
  Speaker 1
  You know, absolutely. And they can get really good people. And you know, one of the things you actually learn about being at the top of a government is, you know, much if you pick up the phone to someone and say, I need you to come and to help, that They will come. I think the problem's not that. The problem is that, number one, and I say this often to the leaders that I work with, because we work in roughly 40 different countries in the world today, and that's only growing. And we have teams of people that go and live and work alongside the President's team, and I kind of talk and exchange views with the President or the Prime Minister. And very often, the two problems are these. Number one, people confuse ambitions with policies. So often I will speak to Leon and I say, so what are your policies? And he'll give me a list of things. And they actually, I say to them, those aren't really policies, they're just ambitions. And ambitions in politics are very easy to have, because they're just general expressions of good intention. The problem comes with the second challenge, which is that though politics at one level, is It, attacking your opponents, it's quite a crude business. When it comes to policy, it's really intellectual business politics. That's why people often, if they've only got ambitions, then they haven't really undertaken the intellectual exercise to turn those into policies. Policies are hard. It's hard to work out what the right policy is. If you take this AI revolution, and I think we're living through a period of massive change, right, this is the biggest technological change since the Industrial Revolution, for sure. For political leaders today to understand that, to work out what the right policy is, to access the opportunities, mitigate the risks, regulate it, this is really difficult work. And so what happens a lot of the time, is that people are elected on the basis they are change makers, because they've articulated a general vision for change. But when you then come to, okay, what does that really mean in specific terms? That's where the hard work hasn't been done. And if you don't do that hard work and really dig deep, then you know what you end up with as I say are just their ambitions and they just remain ambitions.

    - **Note:** Competing incentives in government. You have people who don’t like you and you need to implement ideas against resistance which causes you to be tactful you need to not only have the vision but the operational and the social skills to align incentives with those you disagee with without all those 3 you get gridlock. In politics vs business you’re not choosing your team you have to work with elected people you ran against and who you disagree with so you need to be tactful.
- Lessons from Lee Kuan Yew's Decisions for Singapore
  Summary:
  Insights from Lee Kuan Yew's decisions for Singapore include the importance of making decisions that may seem obvious later but are deeply contested at the time.
  He emphasized the use of English as a global language, attracting the best intellectual and management capital globally, and maintaining zero tolerance for corruption. These decisions contributed significantly to Singapore's success and the importance of empowering leaders to make key priorities to address issues in governance.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  You can learn lessons of what's worked and what doesn't work. And so the fascinating thing about Lee Kuan Yew is, he took three decisions, really three important decisions right at the beginning for Singapore. Each one of them now seems obvious. Each one at the time was deeply contested. Number one, he said, everyone's going to speak English in Singapore. Now, there are lots of people who said to him at the time, no, no, we've been thrown out of Malaysia effectively. We're now a fledgling country, a city -state country. We need to have our own local language. We need to be true to our roots and everything he said. No, English is the language of the world, and we're all going to speak That's what happens in Singapore. Secondly, he said, we're going to get the best intellectual capital and management capital from whatever it exists in the world and we're going to bring it to Singapore. And again, people said, no, we should stand on our own two feet. And you're also bringing in the British who we've got all these disputes with. And he said, no, I'm going to bring in the best from wherever they are And they're going to come to Singapore. Today, Singapore exports intellectual capital. And the third thing he did was he said, there's going to be no corruption. And one of the ways we're going to do that is we're going to make sure our political leaders are well paid, which the Singapore leaders are the best paid in the world by a factor of about 10 for the next person. And there's going to be zero tolerance of corruption, zero tolerance of corruption.
  Speaker 2
  And those are the three decisions that were instrumental in building Singapore today. To the extent that Western governments have, you know, you could go to the UK right now or the US and fundamentally, if you had to narrow down the list of the three key priorities, and what Would who was empowered to do so, what could they do to fix that?

- Four P's of Government in Power
  Summary:
  Prioritize tasks to avoid spreading resources thin and achieve meaningful outcomes.
  Develop policies with input from experts for practical solutions. Select competent personnel. Focus on implementing policies efficiently for successful governance, regardless of the country's size or significance.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So, I describe four P's of government when you get into power. Number one, you've got to prioritise, because if you try to do everything, you'll do nothing. Number two, you've got to get the right policy, what we were talking about before. And means going deep and getting the right answer, and that means often bringing people in from the outside. You can tell you what the right answer is, which has nothing to do with left -right. It's usually to do with practicality. Number three, you've got to have the right personnel. Number four, you've got a performance manager. Once you've decided something and you've got a policy, you've got to focus on the implementation. Now whether you're running the United States of America, you're running a small African country. Those things are always true.

- Adapting to the Shift in Global Power Dynamics
  Summary:
  Efforts were made to adapt to the shifting global power balance by engaging with Russia and integrating China into the world's trading framework.
  Despite recognizing the rise of the East, challenges arose as China and Russia exhibited values seemingly hostile to Western democracy.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I mean, we did try a lot, you know, contrary to what's sometimes written, for example, with Russia. And I, you know, I dealt with President Putin a lot when I was Prime Minister. We also took the crucial decision to bring China into the world's trading framework. The G7 at the time was the G8 with Russia there, and China would always be invited. I think we did try. I honestly think we tried a lot to recognize that we were going to live in a new world. The power was going to not shift from the west in the sense the west would become not powerful, but the east was going to become also powerful. I think we did understand that and worked towards that. The problem is that, and particularly in these last few years, certainly China and Russia have come to a position that is in terms of fundamental values and systems seemingly hostile To Western democracy.

    - **Note:** Realization of putting policy first must be the focus and forget the noise of people talking shit. The issue with politics is unseen areas act on the system the system acts on people to drive then to non optimal positions. Policy before politics.
      Unintended consequences drive the system into bad places through policy resistance
- Keys to Political Success and Adapting to Technological Revolution
  Summary:
  In politics, it is crucial to avoid declaring favorite leaders to prevent creating enemies.
  Successful countries share common traits like stable macroeconomic policies, nurturing business, upholding the rule of law, and providing quality education. These factors are indicators of success, whereas their absence can lead to failures.
  Leaders today should focus on understanding and embracing the ongoing technological revolution.
  Engaging with technology, involving knowledgeable individuals in government, and making strategic decisions are essential to harness opportunities and manage risks effectively.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  You see, George, one of the things you must never ever do in politics is say who's your favorite leader, who's done well, because you will make one friend and many, many enemies. So I'm just going to answer it in this way, that if you look at the countries that have succeeded today, if you look, for example, as any country that was third world become first world, Was second world become first world, there are certain things that stand out and are clear. Number one, they have stable macroeconomic policy. Number two, they allow business and enterprise to flourish. Number three, they have the rule of law. Number four, they educate their people well. And wherever you look around the world and you see those things in place, you will find success. And whenever you find their absence, you will find either the fact or the possibility of failure. The one thing, however, that any country leader should focus on today is the possibility of all of these rules being rewritten by the importance of technology. The single most important thing today, if I was back in the front line of politics, would be, as I say, to engage with this revolution, to understand it, to bring in the people into the Discussions and the councils of government who also get it, and to take the key decisions that will allow us to access the opportunities and mitigate the risks.
