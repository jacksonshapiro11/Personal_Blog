### Highlights

- Interoperability Enhances User Experience
  Summary:
  Broken layer two interoperability significantly impacts users' lived experiences, highlighting the need for seamless integration between different systems to enhance user satisfaction and engagement.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 3
  So I actually think that these two topics that we've brought up so far, the first, the broken layer two interoperability, which is users lived experience. ([Time 0:45:53](https://share.snipd.com/snip/719c9c1f-e79b-4cc4-a3f2-5c355ebf6a2c))
    - **Note:** Eth is bad because of bad lived experience and inability to capture value because of parasitic L2s. Kyle views blockchains as software money computers not as much credibility neutral engines which is why he likes the fastest horse in sol and thinks eth will lose because it has a bad architecture and moves too slow. Not optimized for good UX.
- Human Capital Drives Innovation
  Summary:
  The strength of Ethereum is attributed to its privileged regulatory status and the significant human capital within its ecosystem, which surpasses that of Solana.
  The presence of highly intelligent and motivated individuals in Ethereum fuels innovation and drives progress more effectively than average contributions. While there are potential challenges in system design that could affect this human capital, it remains a key advantage for Ethereum.
  Despite skepticism about Solana's ability to effectively implement Layer 2 solutions, the existence of these alternatives is acknowledged.
  The Ethereum Foundation has established foundational norms and standards for decentralized stewardship that have positively influenced the landscape of Layer 1 and Layer 2 protocols.

  Kyle, this has been really good. I can already read the tweets coming out of this episode. It's going to be a bunch of Eth bulls that were super mad at David and myself for not pushing back at various times during this episode. And I actually think the purpose of this episode, and maybe by the way that this marks the bottom of the Ethereum bottom tick. This is the bottom tick, okay? For you Eth bulls out there now We're doing an episode with Kyle Samani and he's telling us what we got wrong about aetherium. So so maybe there's hope here But I I think the purpose of this episode was just to get kind of your take on it because like the markets right now at Least at this point in the cycle are sort Of showing ether being squeezed between Bitcoin and the strength of its monetary premium type narrative and also Yeah, yes the snowflake ness. Although I don't think Bitcoiners like to be called snowflakes David. So maybe we got to revise that they really do Yeah, and then the the slana side which is coming at with like meme coins and utility and it's easy to use and there's no fragmentation So this Has been very helpful from that perspective I'm going to get you to do one last thing for us, Kyle, if you're willing, and that is to steelman the opposite argument for a second here. So if you're wrong about Ethereum and the strength of its roadmap and the value of Ether as an asset, how might you be wrong? What are the best arguments against yours?
  Speaker 1
  Ether has privileged regulatory status that Sol does not have. That's obviously correct. The total size of the Ethereum ecosystem is larger than Sol on the ecosystem. And specifically, actually, I think the size of TVL is actually not what I think matters. What matters is human capital. And there's clearly more raw IQ points in the Ethereum camp than there is in Solana camp, just as a function of number of people. I'm not making any comments about medians or averages. That, I don't know, or even think is actually the relevant variable. But there's just clearly way more super high IQ people in Ethereum than there are in Solana. That has been true and is still true today. I'm not sure it will be true tomorrow, but it's true today. And look, like what drives the world forward is like super smart people like doing things. Quite frankly, average people doing things does not what like drives incremental progress in the world. It's like super fucking smart, aggressive, motivated people working really hard and making shit happen. That is how innovation happens. And Ethereum has more of those people than Solana does. I think the human capital argument is a legitimate one. Now, I think the human capital argument faces these constraints around system design that I think fundamentally hinder the human capital, but the quantum of human capital definitively Still in favor of aetherium Yeah, those are probably the two I think there are the two best ones Do you think there's anything to the layer two?
  Speaker 2
  Do you think Solana is gonna start adopting layer twos in a form?
  Speaker 1
  People will ship well layer twos on Solana Eclipse. Well, I guess the eclipse is like bridging the ether or whatever But like there's people working on Solana L2s. We've obviously got a bunch of pictures for them. We've passed on all of them. Will they exist? Yes. Will they be used in any meaningful scale? I'm quite skeptical. Well, like their permissionless system, so obviously they will exist. I suspect they will find some niches. I actually think that's a reasonably likely outcome. I am quite skeptical they will replace a meaningful amount of the total economic activity.
  Speaker 3
  Kyle, what's your favorite Ethereum layer too?
  Speaker 1
  They're all to me the same, which is actually I think like one of the most damning things about all of them is like they expend all this energy trying to be different. And like dude, they're all like almost 100% the same EVM with the same apps. And like the so like they're functionally they're fungible, they're fungible to me. Kyle David is trying to get you to say something nice about a theorem towards the end.
  Speaker 2
  So So why do we end with that question? Say something nice about Ethereum, okay? At least with talent. Say something nice.
  Speaker 1
  I like the intellectual capital part. That was pretty nice. I think the EF... These assets are not... I talked about thinking about them in terms of equities in the context of valuation, which I do think is the correct way to think about them. But like there are very real social and political and mechanical differences between being a steward of an L1 or an L2 versus being the CEO of a company. Led the way in creating a lot of the correct norms and standards around being the steward of a system that is ostensibly incredibly neutral, or least incredibly neutral-ish. I think they went too far in a lot of them, but like, I mean, like the original split of the core Ethereum founders like Charles versus Vitalik was like corporate versus like non-profit Kind of a thing, right? And I think that they made the, definitely the right decision. At that fork in the road moment in time and created a lot of the norms and standards that are valid and that most L1 foundations have adopted and should adopt. And I think that was actually quite impression. ([Time 1:07:16](https://share.snipd.com/snip/39abdc12-cb87-4c1f-bebc-1b3b66375e62))
    - **Note:** Sol vs eth and why eth has struggled.
