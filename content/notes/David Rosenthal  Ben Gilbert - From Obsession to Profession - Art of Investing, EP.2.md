### Highlights

- Episode AI notes
  1. A key takeaway from this podcast episode is the power of shared vision and friendship. The speaker and David have a deep friendship and connection based on their shared interests and understanding. This connection was born out of opening up about their shared interests and finding solace and understanding in each other's perspectives. Friendship arises when individuals discover common insights, interests, or tastes that they thought were unique to them. Finding someone who shares unique connections and appreciates them in the same way can lead to a sense of immense solitude.
  2. A notable takeaway from the episode is the process of researching for a podcast episode. The hosts of the podcast combine mesmerizing storytelling with rigorous analysis to create compelling episodes. They conduct extensive research on companies, including reading books, scouring Wikipedia pages, and watching industry talks. Out-of-print books are considered valuable resources for insights. The research process may be daunting, but it eventually leads to a comprehensive understanding of the subject. The hosts have a division of labor, with one person focusing on story and the other on analysis. They don't discuss the episode before recording, allowing for spontaneous and magical moments.
  3. Another key takeaway is the lesson from the Acquired playbook to own the business rather than just being a talent. It's important to have flexibility and make smart decisions in the business world. Building strong relationships and being adaptable are keys to success. While gaining experience and learning from others is beneficial, individuals may eventually want to capture the surplus for themselves by venturing into entrepreneurship. Taking risks and studying successful individuals who are in control of their own businesses can provide valuable insights.
  4. The story of NVIDIA and Jensen Huang highlights the importance of optimism and surrounding oneself with the right partners and friends. Optimism is part of a winning formula and can lead to success. It's crucial to choose friends and partners wisely, cultivating relationships with individuals who share similar values. Authentic connections can be attracted by being true to oneself in professional settings. Finding one's tribe can be fulfilling and enjoyable.
  5. Lastly, the added value of acquisitions is discussed, using examples like Facebook and Instagram. Successful acquisitions involve creating new revenue streams rather than just cutting costs. The best acquisitions bring unique value to the table, such as Facebook's addition of AI and machine learning to Instagram. It's important to ensure that the cultures of the acquiring and acquired companies align for a successful merger. The Disney-Pixar acquisition is a prime example of how a shared culture can lead to incredible success.

  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  David was getting ready to join. And maybe just talk a little bit about your earliest memories of meeting one another. Before you do that though, I want to read an excerpt from one of my favorite books called The Four Loves. And it was written by the polymath, CS Lewis. For those of you enough familiar with the book, really what Lewis is trying to do is deconstruct the concept of love and define it really within four categories where love resides, one Of them being friendship. And he says this about friendship. Friendship arises out of mere companionship when two or more of the companions discover that they have in common some insight or interest or even taste, which the others do not share And which till that moment each believed to be his own unique treasure or burden. The typical expression of opening friendship would be something like, what? You too? I thought I was the only one. We can imagine that among those early hunters and warriors, single individuals, one in a century, one in a thousand years, saw what others did not, saw that the deer was beautiful as Well as edible, that hunting was fun as well as necessary, dreamed that as gods might be not only powerful but holy, or that podcasts could be both riveting in their storytelling and Wicked smart in their analysis. That was obviously my contribution. But as long as each of these percipient persons, by the way, percipient, I had to look at it, means perceptive, but as long as each of these percipient persons dies without finding a kindred Soul, nothing I suspect will come of it. Art or sport or spiritual religion will not be born. It is when two such persons discover one another, when, whether with immense difficulties and semi-articulate rumblings, or with what would seem to us amazing and elliptical speed, They share their vision. It is then that friendship is born and instantly they stand together in an immense solitude.
  Speaker 1
  That is an incredible quote. We sent me that after this. I've never had the words to describe that thing, that thing being, there are so many things in the world where David's the only possible person I could text about it and not because it's Acquired related, but because this is something that connects three dots that I care a lot about that I'm like, oh my God, I can't believe it. And the only other person that I know that would appreciate it in the very same way is David.
  Speaker 3
  We could just end the class right there. That describes that in my relationship to a tea.
  Speaker 1
  And I think it actually was true seven, eight years ago, even before acquired became acquired. Maybe not like the first time we met, but as we get to know each other, it was like, oh, this person is weirdly also into internet nostalgia. And then you're like, okay, this person is just a lot of different things. ([Time 0:21:05](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e3af04d4-a9b0-4cd9-9dc8-a025ce3902ef))
    - **Note:** Finding your person in life that you’re just in tune and in sync theory that other person lockstep. They always had a side project they were working in this compounded their skills and led to their next opportunity always. Acquired was something they did together for fun and compounded into this massive thing first there was apathy then resistance but steady compounding in the right area for 8 years led to success. There is survivorship bias but podcasting is a place where you can build and compound an audience genuinely. They keep the main thing the main thing and let everything else work itself out by making a amazing product.

  Speaker 2
  It's more resilient. In this case, you have both this sort of mesmerizing storytelling component and then this very rigorous, very detailed analysis that's appreciated by some of the world's best investors As just being extremely robust. Would you say that probably an oversimplification but those two components just seem to come together in a way that is drawing a lot of people to want to make sure that they listen to everything That you distribute?
  Speaker 1
  That accurately describes the product and then the question is what goes into making the product. There's a whole bunch of obvious things that I think are skippable just for time. We read every book on a company. We read the Wikipedia page, you click all the links from the Wikipedia page. David has this great thing where he goes and clicks on and uses weird search like Boolean operators to find certain YouTube videos of industry talks that don't have many views but say Interesting things.
  Speaker 3
  Actually, right now currently out of print books are our superpower right now. Just be willing to spend $500 for a book. Why not? If you get insight out of that, that's worth.
  Speaker 1
  Because it's worth $5,000 after we release the episode and mention it. The biggest thing that I think metaphorically, I think about while researching it, it always seems to come true. Our research takes about a month. When we first start, it's usually scary because every time we're reading something new about the company, we're discovering a new little piece of the world that we didn't know exists. It's almost like you're trying to map the world but all you know is your current little square and the rest of it is there's nothingness and you need to go explore and figure out if there's Something over there or not. As you start to map the world, it continues to be terrifying because you're like, oh my god, there's this whole other thing that happened in the 80s that I completely forgot about and Now I need to become an expert on. There's this short seller today who has this really compelling case of maybe this thing isn't real. I know the company's talking a big game about it but how can we get better? What teagas calls can I listen to from customers or what people can I network my way to figure out what the real story is there? It keeps getting more and more daunting and somehow this always seems to happen in the last three or four days before recording. It's almost like the world seems to be expanding and I'm like trying to get my arms around it and it's growing and growing and then at some point I feel my fingers touch around the backside Of the world and I'm like, oh cool. I've got the whole thing now. To use a computer analogy, it's all stored in CPU cache. It's in very short term quick trigger memory and I don't have it organized in a useful way and so then the next few days becomes about trying to take all these random facts that I've learned And things that I'm aware of and intuitions that I've developed and put it into logical buckets and store it in a script that I can read at least for my portions on air but there is this magical Moment sometime in a few days before recording where you're like I've consumed so many articles and talked to so many people that every time I read an article now there are zero or one New things. There's not like five new things. I'm getting the same stuff over and over again such that I can feel confident that I have the story now and that is this rush that happens every time for me when we do an episode.
  Speaker 3
  Rick you're so right. We are the combination of story and analysis and that's the magic. Story without analysis is interesting, bit useless and analysis without story is boring and so that a lot of people aren't going to consume it. Baring those two things together I think has been a very much the secret sauce for us and practically we have an incredible division of labor. I write the story, Ben does the analysis and we don't talk about it before we record. We stumbled into that. We talk a lot about the logistics and structure of an episode but when we record when we come together at the recording session the magic happens live. It's not like we've already discussed the whole episode. That has been a huge piece for making the show compelling.
  Speaker 2
  One more question and then we're going to save some Q&A at the end as well. Just this elusive combination of achieving the extraordinary as an entrepreneur or an investor or really anything professionally and winning in life. I think that might have been a quote that came from you in reference to Saul Price. Interestingly, Saul was one of the few that David highlighted that actually seems like he was able to achieve both. He talks about a lot of the people that he studies through history as cautionary tales. ([Time 1:00:13](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8d2227c9-6eba-4220-92dc-3a557f67f405))
    - **Note:** Research they read everything in and out of print for a month and map the world. Combination of story and analysis but they know they’re ready to record once they wrap their arms successfully around a topic.
- Lessons from the Acquired Playbook: Don't be a Talent, Own the Business
  Key takeaways:
  - There is no plan and time passes quickly without notice
  - Business relationships can be structured in various ways
  - Consider the value of insight before taking action
  - Employment agreements involve a profitable trade for labor
  - Early in a career, the trade-off for experience and learning is usually profitable
  - At some point, individuals may want to capture the surplus for themselves
  - Risk is involved in entrepreneurial endeavors
  - Successful people often become the CEO of their own business
  - Learning from exceptionally successful people comes with survivorship bias
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  There's no plan. We're trying to meet quarters whizz by and we don't notice that they ended.
  Speaker 3
  We can structure our business relationships in whatever ways make sense. That's a huge part of this too.
  Speaker 1
  For certain sponsors who are big sponsors of the show, if they ask us to do an event with them, we do it free of speaking fees and say we're happy to come do it but contractually with a sponsor We're working with, we've redlined CES because David's on a family vacation that week. We just run it like a family business.
  Speaker 4
  These are amazing learnings. I know for Rick and Mia resonates a lot where it's just the two of us and now our partner Greg but just super simple team and approach and we often think about this. One of the friends of part of investing, Will Thorndike always just inspires us to think rationally for the long term. He frames it in the context of capital allocation but we've just taken out of that. It's rare to have a setup, a temperament, a partnership that allows you just to do what you think is right. The constellation of all the factors involved, how important it is with a little one David to have family time or whatever it is you need to block out and maybe this is a good transition To the next part of part of investing for today which is lessons from the acquired playbook. For those who haven't listened to it, you guys did an amazing job a year ago at a capital camp outlining a number of these and Rick and I wanted to dive into a few of our favorites and one of These is this idea of don't be a talent. Own the business and we're hitting on a lot of that right now but can you just say more about that and what that means for a 22 year old. What can you do with that if you almost nobody is actually right out of undergrad starting a company and owning a business. Some are but if everyone's going to not be owning the business right off the bat, what are the lessons for young people on this?
  Speaker 1
  My big one is before you can act on any insight being aware of the insight has value and I think the insight here, although it's not what we originally said in the playbook at capital camp Is anytime you sign an employment agreement, the company is making a profitable trade for your labor. It's not really true at startups because startups are so speculative companies have no idea how much money they can make off of your contributions to the company.
  Speaker 3
  They're either making an incredibly profitable trade or losing a lot of money.
  Speaker 1
  When Microsoft hired me out of college, they paid me, came over what it was maybe $90,000 and the expectation was that I provide far more than that or at least on average across their employees. Since they generate profit every quarter, there's a profitable trade being made off of the labor of employees and that's fine. That is how capitalism works but once you become aware of that, then you can look at the rest of your career through the lens of, do I ever want to capture the surplus that I'm leaving on The table? When you sign an employment agreement, you have capped upside, which that might be great because there's all sorts of things that come with capped upside, certainty, predictability, Benefits.
  Speaker 3
  For 99.9% of people early in your career, you are actually getting an incredible trade out of that because you're getting experience, context, learning, network, mentorship, out Of all that, which is for you going to be a profitable trade. Then for most people, at some point, that equation flips.
  Speaker 1
  It's trying to figure out when you are starting to feel like, actually, I'm no longer willing to trade the surplus here. I want to figure out how to capture it for myself. You guys mentioned at the top of the show or the top of class that you might go negative for a while, that almost certainly has to happen, where there's risk involved in doing something Entrepreneurial because corporations are an unbelievably awesome structure to smooth out lumpiness for all the people that contribute their labor and time in human capital. It's very uncomfortable, and there's no certainty that it's going to work out once you do take that leap. But I think the insight going all the way back to the question of, don't be talent on the business is when you study the very most successful people, the Taylor Swift's, the Oprah Winfrey's, They are their production company.
  Speaker 3
  They are the CEO of their business.
  Speaker 1
  Again, survivorship bias. We are studying people who are four plus standard deviations from the mean of the distribution here. It's always dangerous learning from people who are in the 99.999th percentile of what they do because going back to survivorship bias, again, there is always going to be someone in Some category who is four standard deviations from the mean. And just by doing what they did, it doesn't mean that it's going to work out the same way for you. But there's always someone you can cherry pick and try and reverse engineer their strategy. ([Time 1:06:04](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a5f806ff-7ef8-44ed-859e-e01ec6b0d4b6))
    - **Note:** Don’t be a talent own the business. Companies make a profitable trade for your labor how do you capture the upside. At some point you might want to sacrifice security and independence to capture the upside. There is survivorship bias but there are great rewards for power law people. Optimism always wins.
- The Story of NVIDIA and Jensen Hwang: From Optimism to Triumph
  Key takeaways:
  - Optimism wins in the long run
  - Tough-minded optimism is necessary for renewal and success
  - Short-term strategies may work temporarily, but optimism is part of a winning formula in the grand scheme of things
  - The story of NVIDIA and its success is attributed to Jensen Huang's unwavering optimism
  - Choose your partners and friendships carefully, and surround yourself with like-minded individuals
  - Be true to yourself in professional settings to attract authentic connections
  - Finding your tribe can be fulfilling and enjoyable
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  We're going to jump to my personal favorite. And by the way, there's, I think, 12 of these that were released last summer, we're not going to get to all of them. But I really love this one. And it is probably the simplest, which is just that optimism wins. And I love this for a variety of reasons. It reminds me why Paul is such a great partner in crime here. He's without a doubt one of the most optimistic people that you'll ever meet. And I'm continued to just be astounded at the things that happen around us, where he's just like, oh, that's good. We'll find a way through this would be fine. We're at a point in time where, culturally, there's just a lot of negativity. There's, I guess you could say there always is in the world. But I think there are legitimate sociological reasons why cynicism and skepticism and negativity tend to seem like they're ruling the day. Paul mentioned Will Thorndike. And one of the great gifts that Will gave us that we try to pass on to all of our students as required reading for our classes, John Gardner's essay, The Road to Self Renewal. And it's something we come back to time and time again. I just want to read a little excerpt because it makes this point. He says, for renewal, tough minded optimism is the best. The future is not shaped by people who don't really believe in the future. Men and women of vitality have always been prepared to bet their futures and even their lives on ventures of unknown outcome. If they had all looked before they leaped, we would still be crouched in caves, sketching animal pictures on the wall. But I did say tough minded optimism. High hopes that are dashed by the first failure are precisely what we don't need. We have to believe in ourselves, but we mustn't suppose that the path will be easy. It's tough. Life is painful and rain falls on the just. Mr. Churchill was not being a pessimist when he said, I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat. He had a great deal more to offer. But as a good leader, he was saying it isn't going to be easy. And he was also saying something that all great leaders say constantly that failure is simply a reason to strengthen resolve. We cannot dream of a utopian which all arrangements are ideal and everyone is flawless. Life is tumultuous, an endless losing and regaining of balance, a continuous struggle, never an assured victory. Nothing is ever finally safe. Every important battle is fought and refought. You may wonder if such a struggle, endless and of uncertain outcome isn't more than humans can bear. But all of history suggests that the human spirit is well fitted to cope with just that kind of world. I don't really have any additional questions or commentary around this besides the fact that one of our core values for state of growth is that love wins. And I would suggest, you may disagree, that actually the reason optimism wins is because optimism in a sense is tethered to the broader construct of love. But I do think that time and time again, and maybe some of this does come back to that whole question of duration and time horizon. There's a lot of short term strategies. There's a lot of ways to win over the short term by taking a different approach. But it does certainly seem to suggest that when you look across history with the fullness of time, staying on the side of optimism is part of a winning formula.
  Speaker 3
  This is the story of, I think, all the world's greatest companies. In videos top of mind, we just released part three ups. This is the story of NVIDIA. This is the story of Jensen Hwang. He was the only optimist left in the room so many times, even over the last 18 months. And look at what they've done for the world, for computing, for their market cap, they're what the fifth most valuable company in the world now. Just within the last 12 months, they lost $500 billion in market cap. I don't think that's ever happened before. And get their back stronger than ever. It's been a very compressed timeline over the last 18 months. But that story has played out three or four times over the 30 year history of that company. And Jensen never wavers.
  Speaker 4
  Talking about get the partners you ask for. One of our close friends and mentors is Mitch Rales, co-founder of Dannerher Corporation. And one of their key values and principles is we compete for shareholders. You guys have commented on this before in the Fast Company article. You mentioned when asked who are the listeners to the show, Mr. Rosenthal says, I perceive our listeners to be Ben, somebody who's highly educated in business. He's super smart, doesn't appreciate when things are dumbed down, actively recoils at it. 90% of business content out there is worthless to that person. They actively want to learn, get better, grow, and build great things. You guys also said a capital camp were obsessed with the idea of treating our audience as smart. It's not the fastest path to growth. And we're unabashedly weird about it. But now, and this is six or seven years into acquired when you said this, we ended up with the people we wanted, and we took our time cultivating that crew. Can you guys just comment a bit on this? And again, what's the lesson for someone who's maybe built some friendships in the dorm the last few years, but is going out into life? You have time to pick your friends. In your case, in our case to at Seder Grove, we spent inordinate amounts of time thinking about our shareholders and the people we want to spend time with. What is that meant for you guys? And maybe even throwing some mistakes too, where that hasn't worked out so well.
  Speaker 1
  As you go out into the world as a student becoming a young professional, I made a joke earlier that David and I were capital B business people. I often recall leaving college and going to a job and thinking, I got to put on my big boy pants, took my shirt in, like I took my shirt in at Microsoft into jeans. It was weird. Because I thought that's what people did in jobs.
  Speaker 3
  Also Microsoft in the era that you were there was a funny place.
  Speaker 1
  It was a funny place. It was between eras of greatness. And there will be many times where you hear people using jargon that you don't understand. So you start saying the jargon so you can fit in or people that act a certain way. And you're like, I guess this is how the industry works. So I'm supposed to act this way too. I'm supposed to perform these activities and whether it's golf or night clubs or showing up to work at a certain crazy hour to beat the boss to meetings, whatever it is. There are cultures that are going to feel to you. I guess this is what people do. So it's necessary. And I would just say it might be tough at first, but when you choose to continue to be yourself and don't morph the way you act and the way you talk and the things you say into something disingenuous That seems to fit the puzzle better. Over time, you will attract the people who want to work with you in an authentic way that feel like they could be your partners, that feel like they could be your David to me, Ben, of, wow, I really am just vibing with this person because we're speaking the same language. ([Time 1:11:29](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8190a3b4-a31d-4268-b75f-efb8461cabc5))
    - **Note:** Importance of active optimism you get the partners you ask for. Be yourself and do you to get the partners you want and deserve don’t get stuck being someone else.

- The Added Value of Acquisitions: Lessons from Facebook and Instagram
  Key takeaways:
  - There is a fire and desire in the people building successful companies that sets them apart.
  - Most acquisitions that are done for cost-saving reasons have a limited success cap, while acquisitions that open up new business opportunities have the potential for great success.
  - The best acquisitions often involve adding something valuable to the acquired company that wouldn't have been possible if the company remained independent.
  - Merging companies with different and incompatible cultures is almost impossible to succeed.
  - Acquiring a company with a desirable culture can be beneficial for maintaining the desired culture within the acquiring company.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 3
  Okay, one thing I want to add on this, which is a David Sedner thing that he said recently, there's really stuck with me. And I think it's true in all great companies we've studied. And also this is not talked about as much in today's current culture, but I think it's as true as ever. All these people who are building the world's greatest companies that are doing these things, that are the most valuable that are changing the way to all this stuff, they are the gingus Cons of our era. There is a fire in these people and it expresses itself very differently. But if you're Jensen Huang, if you're Daniel, I could Spotify, if you're Taylor Swift, if you're Oprah, these people, there is something about them that's not just a guy or a girl. There is a fire and a desire in them that they are going to scorch the earth behind them manifest in very different ways, but it is truly a commonality.
  Speaker 2
  One more topic I can't not ask you about. And that's the essence of the original idea of acquired. What have you learned about M&A after all this time? Do you have anything to impart?
  Speaker 1
  One is the same power law thing that works in venture funding or now in public markets. Most are inconsequential or entire failures, but the ones that work can work really well. Instagram, they turned a billion dollars into probably $300 billion of market cap in that acquisition. It's astonishing. The second one is you can only save so much money, but there's infinite upside in revenue generation. So acquisitions that are done for cost saving reasons, how successful those are going to be. They have a cap. But anytime that you're acquiring something that opens up a new business opportunity for you has the potential to go extremely well. So when you look at, we did this top 10 episode, the top 10 acquisitions of all time, and we need to go redo it because there's a handful that we probably need to put in there, including LinkedIn Has been pretty unbelievable. Almost every single one was about creating net new revenue, not about synergy or consolidation.
  Speaker 3
  Yeah, one thing I did that's a recent one actually lesson for me from the mini episode. I think we used to say especially early on in the show, the best acquisitions were the old Facebook style acquisitions of, oh, acquire and then let it still be its own standalone product Thing business. And I think that's mostly true, but I think there's a wrinkle to it that there's often in these cases where things go really well. Most of the things stays the same, but the acquire can add something that wouldn't be there otherwise had the company state standalone and independent. And what we realized, or at least I realized for Facebook acquiring Instagram, that was AI and machine learning that Facebook was able to add to the feed of Instagram. And a business model in Instagram's generate zero dollars and they that Instagram could have built hired ad people and would have taken longer. They probably could have done it on their own. They could not have added the level of machine learning AI talent that Facebook had for machine cultures is almost impossible.
  Speaker 1
  If you have two really strong cultures that are not similar or aspirational to be each other, it's over before you even do the deal. So it's a big one to be aware of. I often look at Disney and Pixar as this pretty amazing success and recent years for Pixar haven't been as good as years past. But the animators at Disney went there trying to be Disney animators of the early 90s. And by the early 2000s, that sort of culture was gone. But that old Disney existed at Pixar. And so by acquiring Pixar, it was almost like all the people who went to Disney trying to be a certain thing. ([Time 1:35:30](https://share.snipd.com/snip/15707c03-d122-4485-b166-0035acfd4613))
