### Highlights

- The Five Levels of Motivation
  Key takeaways:
  - Fear, guilt, shame, anger, and rage can serve as motivators, but they can also leave a toxic residue.
  - Motivating through extrinsic rewards, such as money and fame, can also have negative consequences and create a win-lose mentality.
  - Intrinsic rewards, like living with a sense of purpose and calling, can be motivating without leaving a toxic residue.
  - Play is a powerful motivator for all mammals, along with food and learning.

  Speaker 1
  There are five things that can motivate us. The first thing that can motivate us is fear, guilt, and shame. And by the way, fitting in there as well as anger and rage. And the question is, does fear, guilt, shame, anger, and rage motivate? Absolutely. You don't have to look very far to see that it motivates. The deal is that if you're self-aware at all, you know that eventually fear, guilt, and shame and anger and rage leave a toxic residue. Many of us have motivated our children with fear, guilt, and shame. I thought, I would have thought better of you. Or what's something to be scared of? I'll give you something to be scared of.
  Speaker 2
  I'm disappointed in you.
  Speaker 1
  I'm disappointed in you. And you know, as a parent, you pause and you say, does it work? Well, yeah, sure, especially depending on your kid's personality and temperament, it's going to work a little bit. You'll get a short-term return. But eventually that's going to leave a toxic residue, which is going to look like broken trust between you and your child. So once I start to move to another level of motivation, the next level is extrinsic reward. So does money, fame, perks, does it reward? Does it motivate? Sure. Absolutely. Does it leave a toxic residue? Yeah. You know, if you're motivating your team solely by extrinsic reward, one of the things you know is you've got to keep increasing the capacity to keep feeding the consciousness that You've created. And it also creates people playing a zero-sum game, which creates tremendous win-lose consciousness and all this kind of stuff. Then the next level up is intrinsic reward. Now, this is when I start to live from a sense of purpose or calling. When all of a sudden I start to discover what we call our zone of genius or what it is that lights me up to do in the world. And this is when I start motivating people in my world with authentic appreciation. So these are intrinsic rewards. And they actually are the first level of motivation that doesn't leave a toxic residue. And then the next level above that, this is fascinating, the next one above that is play. All mammals are motivated by food, play and learning. ([Time 0:21:15](https://share.snipd.com/snip/06cc11f5-0fff-4ea2-a484-2671a43dd5ca))
