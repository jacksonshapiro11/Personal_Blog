  Speaker 1
  On the contrary to this day, I like to see the long short community do well together as an asset class and typically and very supportive helpful of those that I'm quote unquote competing against.
  Speaker 2
  You said Julian was a great spotter of talent, and that's something obviously that's been a key part of your role to building Maverick the firm. What does investing talent mean to you? What is behind that idea of that concept?
  Speaker 1
  Well, again, I think very hard to distill in terms of here the two or three attributes you have to have, because whatever magic list you can come up with, there are long list of people that have those attributes and yet do not seem to make it as an investor. And this is something internally we studied with Great Brigger because the end of the day, I would argue investment firm only has two assets, the confidence of the investor race and the talent and dedication of the investment team. And so we work really hard on both those to your point, bringing people in at Maverick Lease is a very intensive process involves a lot of different steps meeting with a lot of different people, a lot of testing work we do, and all that does lead us to making one or two offers a year and those are typically accepted. If you were to look for some of the commonalities, some I think you would expect intelligence, competitiveness, a real passion for stocks, but some are probably a little different Maverick than elsewhere. We spend a lot of time trying to evaluate emotional consistency. So the highs aren't that high, the lows aren't that low. If you're right in your stock picks, meaning you're outperforming on the long side or underperforming on the short side in Jerry Alpha, if you're right, 55% of the time, you are one of the best in the world. That's a really hard number to attain. So at definition, you're going to be wrong a lot in how you deal with quote, unquote, being wrong. And again, it's a very competitive name. And usually there's someone on the other side. So when you're wrong, they're right. How you deal with that is really important because a lot of people, I think, have those moments. They just want to put their head in the sand and wait for the world to pass them by. But in reality, those are some of the most important decisions you make when the sock is going against you. Is that an opportunity as the world misunderstood it? And we need to take advantage of this. Or wait, this is about a different path than we were thinking, this is not a good use for capital. Because yours would be one or the other. So emotional consistency is important. We place a great deal of importance on a team orientation. Now part of that is just from beginning recognizing the environments that I personally enjoy. I like environments where our success is driven by a team. We were talking about this the other day, but one of my favorite sports growing up was basketball. ([Time 0:07:28](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6c8ce480-ddea-4dd4-9ea4-9cbb84bc76b0))
    - **Note:** Hiring ideas outside of intelligence. Emotional consistency when things aren’t going well is vital. Team oriented before everything. Integrity very important. They will fire people for minor integrity violations but be very lenient on many other issues. Integrity over everything and importance of reputation.

  I want to go again back to the beginning seeds of Maverick and why you decided to do it when you decided to do it in 1993. What was the precipitate that made you think, okay, now it's time to strike out on my own and build something separate from Tiger?
  Speaker 1
  I clearly was not looking to leave. Joining was treating me extremely well, both in terms of compensation and responsibility. I loved everybody I worked with. But I was approached by a family, a guy named Sam Wiley, who was really a serial entrepreneur. And he was sworn up to recognize, huh, this hedge fund business model, that's pretty attractive. That works. Let's start one of those. He at the time was the CEO of two different public companies. One was a software company, one was a retailer, and there were both companies I happened to know well. When he went to those management teams, dash for ideas, my name came up in both cases. So we started talking and enjoyed our conversations, but made it clear I had absolutely no interest in leaving. Sam's a pretty competitive guy. So he kept making the idea of leaving more than more than more attractive. And I did know that I always, again, I started playing with Soxman was quite young. I always had this objective to have my own portfolio, to have my results purely determined by my decisions and have it be very clear what those were. And it was clear to me that was very unlikely to have been at Tiger. Again, joining was this very senior guy that would all hell incredibly high regard. But he made every single final decision. And the only catch was I really didn't think I was ready for that responsibility. At the time I was 28 years old, that only been at Tiger for three years. But at some point it hit me okay, easily. You're gonna wake up two, three, five years, who knows, and decide that you're ready. But no one's gonna offer you the opportunity that these guys are being generous enough to put in front of you. So decided really had to force themselves to build the trigger. In hindsight, that was pretty naive. I don't think I fully understood the challenge I was getting myself into, but luckily it worked out.
  Speaker 2
  What were the hardest parts about launching the business itself back in those days?
  Speaker 1
  Well, there weren't a lot of precedents. So one person had left Tiger that point, David Gerstin, Harvard, sort of Orgnot, which was a macro fund. Today you can go to a prime broker and say, I want to hang my shingle and boom, overnight you have the whole apparatus springs to action. ([Time 0:16:38](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e8610ead-9be5-49d3-85d9-36cd40da29b4))
    - **Note:** Didn’t want to leave wasn’t ready but realized he would move in a few years but the opportunity was just there to move now and a similar one may not come again for awhile so he had to jump even not being ready. Started stock picking at 13. Had a good start but in year 3 it was basically make of break and without a good year thus famous firm would’ve died early. It used to be information was scarce now it’s abundant so you need to filter through information. Signal vs noise. Investing edge comes from making a lot of things really good instead of making something amazing they have a few companies 3-5 per analyst and work on doing an overall good job. Diversity of talent. Create a slight edge. Strong team that works together for awhile. Technology trends towards standards. Also looking for secular trends and competitive advantage

  Speaker 2
  The most talented people are actually now doing multiple things across multiple technology fields. So is it people centric? Is it something different? I'm even curious, are there specific things you read or conferences you go to or like literal actions that you feel have most contributed to staying up to speed in again a world that's stricken from a fire hose all the time?
  Speaker 1
  Abdubally, personal relationships are really important for all the bad press, deservedly so that San Francisco gets first quarter this year. There was twice as much money, VC money invested in companies based in San Francisco than the rest of the United States combined. That's still where it's at. And I think AI actually is going to make that even more true. And so yes, to have relationships with people that are thought leaders and also who attract a lot of talent around them is very helpful. You start the question personally, I'm very fortunate in that I work with extraordinarily talented people that will give me to the disease of things they've read, things they've heard, we really should focus on this one, whether it's a sell side reporter, magazine article, etc. But it's a challenge. We haven't really talked about anything else, developing anything else. But one of the most common reasons a person on paper that should be a home run doesn't really make an art world is because up through being a investment banker, college, etc, they lived in a task or unit world. Write this paper, turn it in, take this test, great, build this power port and presentation, build the excel model, yes sir, what's next. And we've tried them into our world. There is no what's next. Every second every day, you got new things floating around and you're never finished. You never can say, hey, I talk to every single customer, every single supplier, and every single competitor, and every single employee, I'm not. It just is not possible. And so your questions are really critical on how do you make the right decisions to use your time as reductively as possible to stay on top. And that's everything from being pointed in the right direction to having a nose of what's going to be important, not important, to have experience, I've read every time I read something or listen to this podcast, it's really been useful. Let's do more of those. But I think it's a really challenging question. ([Time 1:02:21](https://share.snipd.com/snip/eaf0eab1-24d4-4d82-ba9c-8230d38593d6))
    - **Note:** Task oriented world vs white space world where there is always more to do. So the benefit of making the most of finite time and asking the right questions Benefit of bad markets as the differentiator between good and bad funds easy when you’re running downhill. He hired his number 2 after talking about comp for a day then just saying he would be fair and shaking hands and that’s worked ever since 20 years. Importance of high trust in important relationships. When you transition something you need to give full agency if you give someone the keys then keep grabbing the wheel you demoralize them the decisions are probably worse and the system is worse. But giving it up in reality is very hard.
