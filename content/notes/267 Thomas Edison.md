  Speaker 1
  It's part of the colossus podcast network, which this podcast is now part of. It's i did a business breakdown episode with patrick from invests like the best. And it's on edwin land. I think the episode comes out n like a week, hopefully. But essentially it's just like an open love letter about a about edwin land. So anyways, if you're in your practis play right now. You go look for business breakdowns. Just follow that feed, because that'll come out like, hopefy, like a week or two. And there's another one i want you to listen to. And if you can help me find any kind of biography on the founder of rolex, please do. I want to find one, because i listened to the rolex episode on business breakdowns. It's episode 65. I'm not kidding you, it is one of the best podcat i've listed to thousands pocast episodes in my life, right it's one of the best podcast episodes i've ever listened to. It is incredible. Just go listen to it. And with that, let's jump into the book. There were other notable american inventors in his time, but they were more usually lonely, troubled souls. And his personality outshone theirs. By 19 29, two whole generations of americans had grown accustomed to watching the progress of this self educated man who worked in a laboratory that had its windows virtually open to All of the world. He had known how to dramatize his inventions. He had known how to gather interest, faith and hope in the success of his projects.

    - **Note:** Edison was following his natural drift but unlike most entrepreneurs he didn’t have focus which is key to success focus as the through line to success. Edison really followed a different path. Edison was living in the time of America that celebrated the citizen scientist and lone inventor as a way to get rich. He’s very headstrong and independent minded who was constantly having questions and was mischievous. He can’t last in school and has to be home schooled. He hated rote memorization but the teachers thought he was stupid but he was just bored and he became a voracious worker and reader his mom instilled the ideas of following your natural curiosity and this inspired Edison to life long learning a carving his path.
- Young Edison's Resourcefulness and Love for Learning
  Key takeaways:
  - The young Edison showed relentless resourcefulness in his daily trips and long layovers in Detroit.
  - During his layovers, Edison found refuge in the Detroit public library, where he read through the entire collection.
  - This reminds the speaker of a talk by investor Bill Gurley on YouTube, titled 'Running Down a Dream: How to Succeed and Thrive in a Career You Love.'
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  He would leave at dawn, and the young boy would return to home at ten or 11 at night. And so this's the first example of a young edison's relentless resourcefulness. There's all these times when, like, he's writing a train all day long, he has to get off and switch trains, and sometimes there's like this long layover, right? And so what ies he do? He's constantly into in and out of detroit, and he realizes, ha, i have a a several hours layover every day a in detroit. And there's this fantastic library, and this is what i was referencing to you earlier. In detroit. During the hours of layover, he found his way to the public library. This is edison describing this point in his life. My refuge was the detroit public library. I started with the first book on the bottom shelf and went through the lot, one by one. I did not read a few books. I read the library. And so when i got to this section, it made me think of this, what i caught, what i've told you over and over again. I hope you've watched it. Have you watched? I've hope you watched it five times. Y now, what i feel is the best talk on utube four unchpers i, by the investor bill gurley. It is called running down a dream, how to succeed and thrive in a career you love. I will leave a link in the show notes. Any time i say, hey, there's omethingin show notes, it's in the show notes. An your pockets playeris also available at founders par cas to com. Ok. I will leave a link for the full vitio in the show notes. I will also leave blake robins incredible notes on bill gurley's talk. I am going to read from those notes right now. This is the section that came to mind when i read this part.

    - **Note:** Edison worked from dawn to 10 at 12 selling newspapers in the railroad he realized he had a layover in detriot so he spent those hours reading the library no formal school. He saved the train operators sons life and learned the telegraph as a result riding the waves of technology bill gurleys running down a dream. Everything is on the internet but you have no excuse not to learn anything. Edison read everything. Telegraph operators were the digital nomad programmers of their day. Edison used this to learn about electricity and this was a stable job to fall back on if he ever needed it this set the tone for his future but you can’t come t the dots looking forward. Edison rejected his job and just focused on learning which led to him near getting fired he read the book on faraday that changed his life and pushed him to become an inventor a book changing someone’s life. Faraday was his idol Edison purposely worked the night shift because it was less busy. Edison believed in constantly hustling and never slept as a young man. He was working or learning
- Inventing the Stock Ticker
  Key takeaways:
  - The speaker discusses the grand goal of enjoying autonomy and avoiding servitude as an employee.
  - The first invention by the speaker flops, but this leads to many opportunities.
  - History doesn't repeat, but human nature does.
  - During the Gilded Age, speculators in gold and securities heavily relied on the telegraph market.
  - The speaker identifies a willing party and decides to improve upon existing stock tickers.
  - Imitation precedes creation, especially at the beginning of one's career.
  - By improving an existing product, the speaker aims to provide faster and better information to those dealing with gold and financial instruments.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  The grand goal was nothing other than enjoying the autonomy of anch penur and forestalling a return to the servitude of employee. And so his first invention flops. I'm going to skip over that because i thought this was just fastening. And this leads to so many opportunities after this. And it's a great example of that maxim tht you and i always talk about that history doesn't repeat. Human nature does. And so i says, during the gilded age, after the civil war, speculators in gold and securities on all the financial exchanges were, of course, greatly dependent on the telegraph market. Quotations were rusrushed by wire to distant cities and to newspapers all over the world. And so he h's identified a willing party that would pay for his invention, which hes lik. There's these things called stock tickers. They already exist. And i guess, i, i guess i need a pause here too, because this is another maxim thatyou nite always talk about, expecialyt the beginin your career, imitation precedes creation. We are all going to build on the work of e peple i atig befor us. In many cases, the first few iterations of our product are going to be imitations of them. As we understand and we go along and we learn more and we understand more of wha we're doing, then we get to actual creation. So the very and that's, that's exactly what happens in edison's career. The very beginning is i go a, hes aready stock tikers. Let me just take an existing product and make it a little better. Cause it's like, is clearly like the people that are trying to sell gold or speculate in all kinds of financial instruments. If i can get their information faster or better, they will pay me for the ability to do so. ([Time 0:33:27](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1ec9c632-ed9f-4fb2-818f-77a3c48078d9))
    - **Note:** Human nature never changes Edison first job was getting market data to speculators faster which humans still do. Edison first copied peoples inventions replication proceeds creation. He first copied before he understood how to transcend and evolve. Edison when he was young gave up too much equity and got burned every time you need control and you can’t make a good deal with bad people. He made amazing things but had no money. Edison was a genius but couldn’t monetize his advtabge. Ride the wave of technology. The telegraph set the stage for all of Edison’s career. Do work for others create a product for society. Jay Gould used the information to corner the gold market and Edison is operating the gold machines. His first big windfall comes from a patent he wants to sell and he wants 5k but asks for an offer and got 40k he thought he was the richest man in the world.
- The Cautionary Tale of Thomas Edison's Obsession
  Key takeaways:
  - Records of previous experiments and automatic mechanisms were acquired.
  - Edison was highly dedicated to studying chemical books day and night.
  - Edison's cautionary tale highlights the need for balance between professional and personal life.
  - Over-optimization of professional life can have detrimental effects on personal life.
  - Edison's example serves as a warning for driven individuals to establish boundaries in their pursuit of success.
  - Edison accomplished his goal after six weeks of intense study and experimentation.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And indeed, all records of previous experiments and automatic mechanisms were acquired. And one of his employees is describing edison at this point. I came in one night and there sat edison with a pile of chemical books that were five feet high. This is kind of what my house looks like. Ah, but they're just biography is much renerse. He studied them night and day is desk and slept in his chair. I don't do this, thank god, because i've a family. But i'm glad i do have a family, because i think i would. And so another thing about edisons, like the cautionary tale aspect, is, i think expesially, you know, i know a town of bunch printers. We're obsessive people, and i think having guard rails on your obsession is necessary because yous very likely that you'll over optimize. If the history of unch printership is any indicators of such, i think it's highly likely that you'll over optimise a your professional life to the detriment of your personal life. Edison definitely did that. You know, his kids are in this book. And i don't kno f i mn to read this to you later or not, but his kids are in the books. And you know, we din't know our dad. He didn't spend any time with us, that kind of stuff. And if somebody is smart and is driven as edison made this mistake, then what's the likelihood that you and i won't? It's very likely they will. So again, cautionary tail, some alement. I came in one night and there sat edison with a pile of books that was five feet high. He studied them night and day. He ate at his desk. He slept in his chair. In six, six weeks, he had gone through al the books, made two thousand experiments, produced a solution that could do the one thing that he wanted. ([Time 0:46:09](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6ef8bc79-30c0-47db-8b1c-007925371284))
    - **Note:** Edison’s men loved him because he was working by their side as their equal. Edison was obsessive and would read everything on a subject he could. He overoptimized his work for his personal life and never knew his kids be careful of this. Edison started to learn the importance of control and started Menlo Park to help commercialize and monetize his advantage he never did this very well but he invented the first real citizen scientist org. He likes creating not business. Jay Gould paid Edison 30k to switch companies and shorted his old company which went down and he made 20-30x. Jay realized using lateral thinking the telegraph was the next tech after the railroad and wanted to ride that wave network effect tech like the internet
- Understanding Human Nature and Economic Incentives
  Key takeaways:
  - Human nature can lead people to resist and dismiss disruptive innovations that threaten their economic incentives.
  - Sometimes, inventors have to go against established industries in order to bring their new products to market.
  - Edison's invention of the electric light was driven by his desire to bring light to civilization, but it required significant financial investment to build the entire electrical system.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  This is really a lesson on human nature, ifyou think about it. So they don't want to believe, or they don't want to see, or maybe they can't see anything that would disrupt that. So if youre inventing something, or your new product, it renders another product obsolete, probably the worst place to go and sell that product is to a person that has economic incentives That your product does not continue. I talked about this on episode 200 with james dyson. Cause he's like, what the hell is going on here? I built a technologically superior vacuum. I go to the vacuum cleaner companies and they don't even see it. They're like, this is crap. And he realized, thak, oh, my vacuum is bagless. It does not have a bag. And these dudes sell 500 million dollars worth of bags every year. Of course they don't want they can' see what is against their economic incentives. And so thats when he realizes, like, i got to do this myself. So this is when he invents the phonograph. And going to skip over that part, because what he does is he sets it aside. Soits like the lack of focus, or different area o focus, i guess, one way to think about it. And he starts getting this idea that he's eventually got n event which is the electric lightball ray. And this is one way to describe that. One undertaking particularly gripped his imagination. It was described as being that of dispelling night with its darkness from the arena of civilization. Dispelling night with its darkness from the arena of civilization is what you and i call the electric light. So edison's going to need a ton of money to build out the entire electrical system, right? ([Time 0:57:49](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3cd5ff43-1f6e-4db5-b6a8-bdaf7c455446))
    - **Note:** Menlo Park was Edison at the peak of his powers at the expense of his social life. He tries to sell the telephone to western union the largest telegraph operator they don’t want it human nature and incentives were wrong for them to buy it. He has extreme confidence and inspired others to believe. Belief and self belief is infectious. Passion creates opportunities. Life is problems you can’t eliminate problems you need to be a good problem solver. He partnered with JP Morgan who provided the financing to create GE but then took his company. Edison was constantly inventing and what differentiated him is he never gave up. He knew problems were inevitable and soluable and this just fired him on. He believed he would always figure it out.
- Challenges of Edison's Financial Backers
  Key takeaways:
  - Edison faced frustrations and had to manage the expectations of employees and investors
  - He believed that difficulties were temporary and would be figured out
  - Edison's financial backers experienced hope and pessimism during the transitional stage of invention development
  - Edison's attitude of not caring about others' opinions and focusing on the work was admired
  - New York has the highest population in the United States
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And one thing that edison had to contend with was, not only was it very frustrating if he found like a dead and and he couldn't get it to work the way he wanted to, he also had to manage the Expectations of not only his employees, but also his investors. And he was remarkable at always putting together like this front. And it was prbly true that he absolutely believed that whatother difficulties they were going through at the oint, at the time, were temporary, and that they'd figure it out. And i think the best description of this is that quote by mark and dreceny says, if you're starting a business or a running start up, you only experience two emotions, a euphoria and terror, And almost nothing in between. And so that's also occurring with his backers, his financial backers, which was a big pain in the ass to edison. Hope and pessimism alternated in the minds of edison's financial sponsors during the transitional stage between invent the invention and its development. And so i mentioned earlier how he managed and why people liked him a working when he was a young man in his twenties, we still that we see that's still the same case at argueme, the most important Part of his life, which is when he's in new york trying to make his electrical system work right. And so it says to the young electricians, it was wonderful to see edison working by their side, all covered with grease and suit. What they enjoyed most was his attitude of caring nothing for what others thought of him, and paying no attention to frills and fancies. So wit their tongue mos to say, new york has the highest population in the united states. ([Time 1:10:22](https://share.snipd.com/snip/90730206-355d-411d-8be7-b3544ac059d3))
    - **Note:** Edison had a massive internal locus on control he worked in the factories and just wanted to create for the fun of it. His employees respected him because he was working with his men in the trenches every day. Men respected that he lived and died with it all. Edison was a learning machine constantly curious asking every question and getting to the right questions. He was always looking for things that how he found things. He went into business and lost touch with engineering which wasn’t him following his drift. He pulled electricity out of a vacuum because he was curious
