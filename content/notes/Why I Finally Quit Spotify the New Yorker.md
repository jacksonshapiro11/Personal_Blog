- Summary: Kyle Chayka decided to quit Spotify because its new interface made it difficult to find the music he wanted. He felt that the app was pushing him to accept algorithm-generated suggestions rather than allowing him to choose his own music. After deleting Spotify, he switched to Apple Music, which offered a better experience for accessing his music library.

### Highlights

- The writer Cory Doctorow coined the term “[enshittification](https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys)” to describe the negative consequences of such corporation-centered design. When I spoke with Doctorow the other day, he said that once companies “lock in” their users—by offering an enticing product, such as Spotify’s buffet of music—they can then “exert control over those users.” In essence, the product can afford to become incrementally worse, to test our tolerance for digital discomfort. (“Why not make things as obnoxious as possible?” Doctorow said.) We’ve seen this happen with Facebook, with Google Search, with Uber, and even with dating apps. Doctorow compared Spotify to Walmart, a monopolistic intermediary with little creative input of its own that nevertheless exerts enormous influence on the array of products we can access.
