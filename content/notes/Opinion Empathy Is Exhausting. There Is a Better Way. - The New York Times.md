- Summary: In the wake of recent violent events, many people may feel helpless and numb, unable to take action or offer support. This feeling is known as empathic distress, where people feel overwhelmed and immobilized by the suffering of others. Empathy is not always helpful, and can even lead to depression or withdrawal. Instead, cultivating compassion can motivate people to reach out and offer comfort and support to those in need. Acknowledging people's pain, even if we cannot alleviate it, can make a difference and help combat feelings of helplessness.

### Highlights

- But when two neuroscientists, Olga Klimecki and Tania Singer, reviewed the evidence, they [discovered](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=5rmMnvgD40UC&oi=fnd&pg=PA368&dq=%252522compassion+fatigue%252522+%252522empathic+distress+fatigue%252522&ots=lyeGFTjRgO&sig=DF74eZPjmpKJxbA7B7nKvgGo34k#_blank) that “compassion fatigue” is a misnomer. Caring itself is not costly. What drains people is not merely witnessing others’ pain but feeling incapable of alleviating it. In times of sustained anguish, empathy is a recipe for more distress, and in some cases even [depression](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pchj.482). What we need instead is compassion.
  Although they’re often used interchangeably, empathy and compassion [aren’t the same](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-46141-001). Empathy absorbs others’ emotions as your own: “I’m hurting for you.” Compassion focuses your action on [their emotions](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-46141-001): “I see that you’re hurting, and I’m here for you.”
  That’s a big difference. “Empathy is biased,” the psychologist Paul Bloom [writes](https://www.amazon.com/Against-Empathy-Case-Rational-Compassion/dp/0062339346). It’s [something](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352250X1630080X) we usually reserve for [our own group](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02265.x), and in that sense, it can even be “a powerful force for war and atrocity.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkk0qqqbwpfvrkrsndhnfkjw))
    - **Note:** Empathic distress when we feel the pain of others through empathy but we should really provide support through compassion one burns us out the other allows us to help others for tangential trauma. We need to pick the problems and issues we shoulder head on and when someone you care about has an issue you shouldn't feel that same pain but offer support. If your friend broke their arm you shouldn't break yours but offer support in their time of need with what they need same way emotionally
