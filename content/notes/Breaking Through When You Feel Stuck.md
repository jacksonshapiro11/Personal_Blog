  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So I've spent a long time trying to understand why this happens and how we can get unstuck.
  Speaker 2
  What is the difference between adversity and being stuck?
  Speaker 1
  It's a matter of degree more than anything. So we all experience momentary stuckness. Every day there will be minor frustrations, minor bits of adversity here and there. Being stuck really means you've been in mind in a particular position for a fairly long period of time, weeks, months, years, sometimes decades or longer, and that there's something you can do. It's within your power to make a shift, but you're not exactly sure what you should be doing.
  Speaker 2
  It sounds like a different level than procrastinating too, although that might be part of it.
  Speaker 1
  It's definitely part of it. Yeah. So I do talk about procrastination and that feeling that you can't get started. And that's true for creatives, but it's true for people who are stuck in jobs. They don't want to be in, it's true for people who are in friendships or relationships that aren't working for them where they feel they need to pivot. There are ways around procrastination. So it turns out that small bursts of action, even if they're not themselves directly productive, they don't produce something that's usable per se, are great unsticking mechanisms. Just the act of acting itself is one of the best unstickers.
  Speaker 2
  What is happening psychologically then in these periods of being stuck?
  Speaker 1
  It's very uncomfortable. I've been running the survey on thousands of people around the world asking them about their experiences of being stuck. And the two things that come up most often are that it's tremendously immersive. It just doesn't feel good to be stuck, which is not surprising. But it's also, despite the fact that being stuck or getting stuck is universal, for people, it feels like a very lonely experience. It's very isolating. And so there's something liberating about learning that you're not the only one. The first response we have to being stuck is a kind of flailing response. We sort of confuse being psychologically stuck, mied in a situation we don't want to be in with being physically stuck. And it turns out that it is very adaptive when you're physically stuck to flail and to fight your way free of whatever it is that's entrenching you or trapping you. But that's deeply unproductive when it comes to strategizing and figuring out the best way to move forward in domains where you need to be a bit more thoughtful and strategic. That's a pretty big part of getting unstuck, at least at first, is to slow things down. And a lot of that comes from realizing that where you are is okay, that you can accept it, and then figuring out what the next best course is.
  Speaker 2
  Yeah, talk a little bit more about that because you can imagine that if you're trying to slow things down, it seems like the opposite of what you should be doing if you're stuck, right? That you should be moving forward or trying to do something.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, there are some really interesting paradoxes in the research about how to get unstuck. And that's probably the first one that you tend to want to do things now immediately in a quite urgent way. And that's often the worst thing you can do for getting unstuck in the long run. The sort of slowing things down, both as a leader when you're dealing with people who you work with, but as an individual who's trying to work through your own issues, it's really, really important to turn down the temperature, slow things down, take a beat.

    - **Note:** Getting unstuck whether it be too much procrastination or stuck in a bad job or relationship you need to get the ball rollling. Getting stuck is universal but feels lonely and when we’re stuck we flail but we need to accept our space slow things down first then proceed. You need to take stock before progressing.
- Strategies for Getting Unstuck and Moving Forward
  Summary:
  You'll never get unstuck if you just feel comfortable about where you are, even when you're struggling. The next thing is to figure out what the right strategies are and what sorts of things you can do to get unstuck. What's your favorite strategy? Well it sort of depends on the nature of the stuckness. I think one that I really like is this idea of who to consult.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I mean, I think one thing that's very valuable as a general psychological truth is that labeling hardship of any form when you're going through it is helpful because it tells you that it's not this strange, unusual, unique thing that no one's ever gone through before, but rather it's just the natural course of things and you happen to be in that phase at that particular point in time. So that's at least psychologically and emotionally a really comforting idea. But we obviously can't just stop at dealing with the emotions because you'll never get unstuck if you just feel comfortable about where you are, even when you're struggling. So the next thing is to figure out what the right strategies are and what sorts of things you can do to get unstuck. And that's why you need a roadmap. And that's what I've sort of tried to do in the book is to say, well, once you've marshaled all your emotions and you've come to grips with the fact that you're dealing with what is an unpleasant situation, let's talk about the next step. You've accepted. Now let's figure out how to move forward. And that's where the strategies and behaviors come in.
  Speaker 2
  What's your favorite strategy?
  Speaker 1
  Well it sort of depends on the nature of the stuckness. I think one that I really like is this idea of who to consult. I think we tend to find being stuck, as I said, very isolating. But humans live in a social universe and we're a very social species. And so what we often tend to do is we have friends who are a lot like us or a brain trust of people we trust who are a lot like us, a lot of leaders put together teams that look quite a lot like they do in certain respects, similar intellectual backgrounds, perhaps similar demographics. And there's a lot of research showing that consulting with people who are, the technical term is non-redundant. ([Time 0:12:17](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2b0e00a4-a4a3-419f-a71b-7f2e6a440f60))
    - **Note:** First emotionally accept you’re stuck then work on a plan to get unstuck. Consult people unlike you to get a diverse perspective who can weight in or even push back on your thinking. Get the outside and inside view.
- The Importance of Failing Well in Management
  Summary:
  The myth that the best workers don't fail is extremely damaging. It suggests there's a culture where people aren't given room to make those errors. For optimal growth you need to fail between one and six times, he says.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  That was a manager would you approach it then to help somebody through this situation?
  Speaker 1
  The first thing to do is to as as Miles Davis did with Herbie Hancock is to turn the temperature down a little bit. I think managers need to make room for people to fail to to make mistakes as they grow. And we know that to some extent but there's there's this very interesting research on on how to fail well and failing well involves first of all failing roughly the right amount of time and that's true about people that you're managing as well and depending on the domain for optimal growth you need to fail between one and six and one and four times you try something. That's obviously going to vary a lot depending on the situation and the individual but the the key takeaway from that is that failure is necessary and this sort of myth that the best workers don't fail they don't make mistakes they don't do wrong is extremely damaging and it also is damaging for the actual organization the lot wider organization because it suggests there's a culture where people aren't given that room to make those those errors.
  Speaker 2
  Anything else for managers and leaders to to know about you know when to embrace the stickiness and then when to try to change the thinking and push through it? ([Time 0:21:38](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3a64e613-f3a4-49ae-8a2a-1caece9aee82))
    - **Note:** You need to embrace failure and fail 20% of the time to avoid stagnation. Exploration try different techniques. Explore exploit. We plan too much we don’t do enough. Best way to get unstuck is to just do.
