- Imitation proceeds creation Oprah wanted to be like Barbra Walter’s before she realized she had to be herself she took equity in her business which made her rich. Success came when she stopped trying to ask eloquent questions and instead listen to answers. She had intense self belief and thought she’d be an actress before she’d been discovered. Got demoted from anchorwoman to morning show talk host at 22 in the beginning she was ashamed but then realized this was her calling she could be her authentic self and genuine. Thoughts are the biggest drivers of success many of these people visualize success before they achieve it. Visualise success then create reality from that feeling. Her big break was the color purple she played a girl who was molested at a young age like she was. She had a premature baby at 14 and took it as motivation this couldn’t be her life and actively embedded change in it to become who she wanted by working relentlessly ([Time 0:06:30](https://share.snipd.com/snip/de582a7a-c53f-4e05-9bee-1e3884f920dc))

  Speaker 1
  It's like, you want to be in movies. One of my favorite episodes I did last year was episode 314, which is on Paul Graham's excellent essay on how to do great work. Listen to this. This is exactly he's going to talk about the exact phenomenon that you and I are discussing right now in the story of Oprah. This is how this is Paul Graham on how to make yourself a big target for luck. When you read biographies of people who've done great work, it's remarkable how much luck is involved. They discover what to work on as a result of a chance meeting or by reading a book they happen to pick up. So you need to make yourself a big target for luck. And the way to do that is to be curious, try lots of things, meet lots, meet lots of people, read lots of books, and ask a lot of questions. Oprah, inadvertently, is making herself a big target for luck. And here is another lucky break. This is hilarious. She tells the story later on when she's 60. So the other talk I'm going to talk to you about as well. So she's a sophomore year in college. You know, somebody heard her on the radio said, you know, we heard her on the radio, which we were interested in working in television. And at the first she turned it down. And she's in college at a college professor and she's telling them, hey, like CBS keeps calling me to be on television. And she goes, but if I do television, I'll never finish school, meaning I'll never finish college. And he says something in hilarious. He goes, fool, that is what school is for. You go to college. So CBS calls you and she was, you need to call them back. And because her her professor called her a fool, and it's like, what are you doing? ([Time 0:31:37](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e174df71-248d-462a-86ae-92425591557f))
    - **Note:** Oprah was always practicing and made herself a big target for luck increased surface area she fit in the radio and tv for this just by taking opportunities. She moved out of her moms and in with her dad who instilled discipline and work ethic in her that gave her the structure she needed. She dropped out of college to work at cvs. She would work 16 hours in college. Had a divine discontent for performance and always looked forward about how she could improve her performance. Critics are our friends they show us our faults. She always followed her heart over her head for more money and was authentically herself. Luck is preparation meeting opportunity and asking for help is a superpower. She would always say she could do something then ask help from others on how to do it.
- Do a job that you would do for free and let people dream on things. Her lawyer helped her see she could own her own show not just be a worker. Blew the doors off what she expected of her life dreamed bigger. Works 14 hour days she feels uncomfortable when she gets comfortable. Do work that feels like play. Someone told Arnold they worked so hard they worked 12 hour days and he asked what else they did because that day is 24 hours. Her father installed discipline and high standards. She had a great job as an anchorwoman people told her how amazing it was but she wanted to follow her own path and do her own thing. Quit high status to take a low status job in talk shows with a lot of competition that they said she couldn’t conquer Phil Donahue was the guy in Chicago no one believed she could unseat him but she loved it believed in herself and kept going. She smokes Donahue because she understood the people watching were women like her and knew how to relate. ([Time 0:40:01](https://share.snipd.com/snip/25d74b8a-f0d9-4ea0-985d-44f3e057bd20))

    - **Note:** Work that feels like play and creating equity ownership for upside. She worked incredibly hard and had great discipline and high standards. She was following a path as an anchor women but wanted to do a talk show which was lower status and had a monopolistic competition, but she understood her customers better than the competition and smoked them. She needed to work hard she never got complacent
- Gender Pay Gap in News Anchoring
  Key takeaways:
  - She discovered that her male co-anchor was making more money than her, despite doing the same job.
  - The reason given for the pay difference was that he had more financial responsibilities.
  - Rather than fighting or complaining about the pay disparity, she decided it was time for her to leave.
  - Charlie Munger shared a similar perspective, choosing not to sue when he was ripped off or lost money.
  - Both Oprah and Charlie Munger emphasize the importance of learning from experiences and moving on rather than dwelling on legal battles.

  And so she was working as a news anchor.
  Speaker 2
  This is in Baltimore.
  Speaker 1
  And she finds out like she is a co anchor. And you know, we're literally doing the same job. We sit next to each other. Why is he making so much more money than me? And so you remember, she's very young. Most of the people in the industry are much older. And they're like, well, we have to pay him more because, you know, he's married. He's got kids. He's got to pay college tuition. He's got a mortgage. You don't have a mortgage. You don't have, you know, kids, anything else. And she just couldn't believe it. But her response was fascinating. She goes, I didn't complain about it. I did not file a lawsuit about it. I knew that in that moment that it was time for me to go. And that's when I started the process of preparing myself for it to leave. I told myself I will not be here long. When I had dinner with Charlie Munger, he said something was fascinating too. He said that he wouldn't sue people when earlier in his career, when they ripped him off, or cost him money. And his response was that you should expect it and it's better to move on. And so obviously, a lot of one big thing is like, if you're in a good business and you're on good people, you'll be able to prevent most of the problems that you actually need to solve. And so wisdom is prevention is one of my favorite maximums of his. But he's just like, you know, people rip me off. They cost me money. I didn't waste my time in a lawsuit. I just learned from it and then moved on. We say, see a similar sentiment here with Oprah. ([Time 0:49:21](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ed90fea4-48bc-4a07-86eb-01f59da52a64))
    - **Note:** Charlie munger wouldn’t sue people when they ripped him off he’d just move on Oprah was underpaid earlier in her career and she didn’t complain she just left. She found her path by finding out and listening to your inner voice telling you this isn’t what you should do. She lives from the inside out with belief and following the path she wants. Oprah knew everyone needed validation and to feel important really understood her customer and what they wanted. She asked to skip kindergarten in kindergarten and ends up skipping to 2nd grade she understood her customer and compounded her talk show advantage for 20 years. She knew her customers well because they were her. Find and follow what feeds your passion. Your real job is to find out why you’re really here and start living and doing that.
