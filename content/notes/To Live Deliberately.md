- Summary: The author reflects on Thoreau's idea of "living deliberately" and the importance of engaging with the physical world. They share their own struggle to balance abstract thinking with material existence, seeking a reset in their life. Ultimately, they emphasize the need to remember our embodied experience while navigating daily life and creative pursuits.

### Highlights

- [In the painting, titled Reclining Nude](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/461643), a woman reclines on a couch, as is common in traditional Western art. But in this image the tradition is upended. The figure is contemporary, not classical, and the painting seems intended to provide not the experience of *looking* at the figure, but rather the experience of *being* the figure: of being a fully embodied human being who is lying on a couch.
  Its emphasis, as I see it, on the experience of being alive as a human being in a physical body in the physical world, reminds me of a passage by Thoreau, at the start of the second chapter of *Walden*.
  The chapter begins:
  > I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. […. ] I wanted to [… ] live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms, and, if it proved to be mean, why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it, and publish its meanness to the world; or if it were sublime, to know it by experience, and be able to give a true account of it in my next excursion.

    - **Note:** The deliberate life of seeing the world as it is. When we see the world without the many dreams of fancy that distract us when we live deliberately in nature what does it look like?
