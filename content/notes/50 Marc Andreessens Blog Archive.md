  I's because founders give you the ability to learn from history's greates unch printers, quickly, so then you can use their ideas in your work. And that's exactly what mark and dreson did. He's read a ton of biographies of great people came before him. He studied the onch prnters that came before him. He talks about it over and over again. In fact, you'l hear it in this preview too. And mark's career has benefited immensely from this knowledge. He actually just made the news recently ecause he just bought the most expense house in california history. He bought a house for a hundred 77 million dollars. So when you hae somebody like that that, for all intents of purposes, has unlimited resources, could choose to learn from anybody on the planet, and yet he still chooses to pick up a biography and read a lot of history, that clearly tells you how valuable this activity is.

This series of posts, i will walk through some of my accumulated knowledge and experience in building high tex start ups. My specific experience is from three companies. I have cofounded, net scape, opswer and ning. But more generally, i have been fortunate enough to be involved in and exposed to a broad range of other start ups, maybe forty or 50, in enough detail to know what i'm talking about. As a board member, as an angel investor, as an adviser, as a friend of various founders and as a participant in various venture capital funds, much of my perspective is based on silicon valley and the environment that we have here, the culture, the people, the venture capital base and so on.

    - **Note:** Agency and creation are the reasons to do a start up. Speaking things into sxisyajdd and then changing the world and creating the culture intentionally. Start ups are bad because you’re oscillating between elation and dispair in building a start up constantly. You only experience euphoria and terror. In a start up nothing happens unless you make it happen not like a big company which can just drone on. Start ups don’t have the systems in place before they start so they all need to be built. Start ups hiring is vital but very hard to get people to leave their great jobs. In start ups there is a massive power law. And the big factors are team product and market. The most important thing in a start up is the market. The team and product can be built but you cannot invent demand. Great products and great market is the big success outcome. You need to first get to product market fit in any market. You can do a lot wrong but your first and foremost goal should be obtaining product market fit this then kicks off the future of the company.

  Speaker 1
  Maybe eight people, maybe ten, 15, 20, and sometimes many more. So he's goin to tell tha story here, which sounds like it's made up. I don't think he's lying to us, but thiss, this is so ridiculous. When i was at i b m in the early nineties, they had a formal decision making process called concurrence. On any given issue, a written list of the 50 or so executives from all over the company who would be affected by the cision in any way, no matter how minor, would be assembled. And any one of those executives could non concur and veto the decision. That's an extreme case, but even a non extreme version of this process, and all big companies have one. They have to is mind bendingly complex to try to understand, even from the inside, let alone the outside. And so he continues. He says, you can count on there being a whole host of impinging forces that will affect the dynamic of decision making on any issue at a big company. You can't possibly even identify all the factors that will come to bear on a big company's decision, much less try to understand them, much less try to influence them very much at all.

Moby dick might stalk you for three months, then jump out of the water and raise, raise a huge ruccus, then vanish for ([Time 0:24:35](https://share.snipd.com/snip/034943f5-97c3-46fc-a612-13f1d0ee894a))
    - **Note:** Big companies are very tough to deal with so don’t build a start up that relies on big companies. I’m doing deals with you they often are difficult and jerk you around. Be careful when dealing wiry big companies. Big companies can be irrational as there is a ton of beuracracy making the obvious seem impossible. They also make follwer decisions rather than focusing on the product and market. Don’t get obsessed with doing deals with big companies. Start ups initial plan usually won’t work so you need to seek a big market and have a plan within that market than perfecting a plan ahead of time. Far to complex so you need to learn as you go. Most of success is what happens when you’re bust making other plans do maintain your optionqlory and be willing to pivot.
- Pursue opportunities don’t plan careers. Career planning is career limiting because it keeps you on a track you can see but the world is constantly evolving so saying you’re going to do things may be non beneficial jist build skills and maintain a dynamic view of your career. Opportunities present themselves to you right place and time then there are those you create for yourself. Opportunities present themselves when you’re least expecting them and go quickly so you need to act fast. The world is a malleable place and will reconfigure itself around you must easier and quicker than you think if yiu know what you want and go for it with max drive and passion. Most people don’t have this approach to opportunities. You create a portfolio of jobs roles and opportunities each job has a risk return and think about this in the context of your life and time in your life. Does this type of risk fit in your strategic job portfolio there is always risk and return. Risks you should understand and take respectively such that you’re getting properly compensated. Most people are either too risk seeking or averse yiu need to callabrate your risk return profile so you’re taking the right risks. Be open minded to changing jobs if you know you are unhappy. Properly understand risk and return very calibrated risk return matrix. If you don’t like a job don’t justify it to yourself move on. Pay attention to opportunity costs at all times. Opportunities are very rare you need to grasp them when you encounter them. ([Time 0:33:52](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0813066f-2765-4cbb-8d04-5baf29a2f30d))

    - **Note:** Do not have jobs but build skills and pursue opportunities. The world will change and you need a portfolio of talent that grows with the world. Opportunities are created by you and presented to you they can be gone quickly so you must pounce. Career is a dynamic system. Risk and return in jobs you want a portfolio of opportunities some start ups some seasoned companies different locations ect so that it fits your great expanse of your life. If your job isn’t working move on.
      Properly calibrating your risk return matrix is vital don’t be too risk seeking in life but also don’t be too risk averse these are both awful you need to see reality as it is.
      Life is a dynamic system your career is a portfolio not a thing and you need to calibrate your risk return matrix for your unique differentiation and goals.
- You can either be the best at something which is very hard or combine being very good at a few things opt for combination of being very good at. Capitalism rewards rare and valuable you get this by combining a wide array of pretty goods until no one has your unique differentiation. Leaders are rarely the best in one area but rely on combination of many things.
  Skills to build 1. Communication 2. Learn how to sell things and convince people to do what they want when it’s something you want. The organizational kid. Don’t love an orchestrated existence get a dose of the real world and really challange yourself you need to make tough decisions with real consequences in a deeply probablistic environment. Make tough decisions by yourself in the absence of good information and live with the consequences. Get in the real world and go levered long on yourself and you’ll make mistakes and screw up but you have to failure is the essence of life yiu cant let this phase you you need to fail. Make success or failure highly visible. This can’t phase you get right up and keep on going. This ability to recover from adversity is foundational to success.

      Organization kid defference to authority working hard and failing within a box vs stepping outside of that box facing real fear taking real chances with real consequences to do something really great. Real success only comes from real risk. Take chances
