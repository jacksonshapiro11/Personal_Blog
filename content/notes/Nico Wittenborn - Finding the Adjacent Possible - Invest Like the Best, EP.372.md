- Exploring the Adjacent: Fostering Curiosity and Innovation
  Summary:
  The concept of the adjacent possible refers to the exploration of what is possible at a given moment, which is a personalized journey for each individual.
  This idea of exploring the adjacent is crucial not only in identifying investments but also for entrepreneurs in discovering new opportunities. The speaker's curiosity was sparked by the introduction of the iPhone and its possibilities, leading to investments in technologies like LiDAR scanners for creating virtual 3D objects.
  The evolution of gaming into streaming services, exemplified by companies like Backbone, further showcases the importance of exploring what the technology enables and the opportunities it presents.
  This curiosity-driven exploration is not limited to personal interests but also extends to collaborating with founders who bring innovative ideas that align with this mindset of discovering and leveraging the adjacent possible.

  Speaker 1
  So the adjacent possible is this abstract idea of this is what is possible at a specific point in time. But then how you find that is actually a very individual adaptation of that idea. And so how I express it is exploring the adjacent. And that's something that I think is both true for how I find investments. But it's also true for a lot of the entrepreneurs that I work with and the adjacent that they explore. This is a natural curiosity. And this started when the first iPhones came out for me where I just wanted to understand how it works, what opportunities it opens up and what it creates. And I guess a natural curiosity around what that technology enables and then playing with it, using it and thinking about what could that lead to. And this is still true now. There's investments that I've done with the LiDAR scanner was added to the phone, which opened up the ability for you to scan with your phone any 3D objects and then make it a virtual state That led to an investment in cooperation and to a company that is completely focused on that. Similarly, gaming, evolving, becoming a streaming service. We talked about backbone a bit. And I think the idea of native streaming coming to all platforms, where you basically skip the need to have a hardware component like a console, what does that open up? What are those opportunities? And oftentimes that can just come from my own exploration of where I'd like to spend time and is ignited by my own curiosity. But it can also be the founders and what they come up with and then bring to you and you just need to understand, does it match?

    - **Note:** Most innovations come from the adjacent possible. In evolution or otherwise you have a new platform which opens a white space for the adjacent Possible exploring this area leads to new discoveries. Uses investments to learn about a space from the front even if it’s not the best risk return because it’s about building a platform. Don’t always invest in what you know but invest to create skin in the game and spur learning on. Consumer businesses have upfront payment for future events and this creates a flywheel to invest in your business. Take money upfront invest in growth. This is an important flywheel. Taking cash up front creates a positive cash cycle and requires less capital creates flywheel. Monetize less early and grow overtime. Test pricing and willingness to pay. Hard to go from free to paid. Consumer subscription about paying for time not 3rd parties monetizing it. Connection over time best experience for users.
      Finding new platforms explore new emergent space invest then learn create positive cash cycle and deeper connection.
- Simplicity and Attention to Detail in Building Great Products
  Summary:
  Great products are characterized by simplicity in functionality and attention to detail in every aspect of the user journey.
  A successful product focuses on doing a few things exceptionally well without confusing users on how to use it. The founders' meticulous thought process is reflected in the product's smooth user experience, minimal friction to get started, and quick time to create a 'wow' moment for users.
  Additionally, the insight suggests that a great product is a reflection of the founder's diligence, care, and hard work, indicating their qualities more than personal interactions.
  Starting small with a specific use case and target demographic, then gradually expanding based on customer feedback and data insights, is crucial for achieving product-market fit and long-term success.

  Can you tell the story of Bird Buddy? I think that's such a beautiful example that closed this little section of discussion.
  Speaker 1
  Bird Buddy is a digital birdhouse. Very easy to dismiss as funny. And in fact, they were laughed out of lots of investors. And we literally heard them laugh in the next room. I always find that interesting though, because okay, do you just dismiss it because it's funny to you? Or have you really thought about what could be built from here? I think I like quirky things, but I also like to think about it deeply and then say, but have you actually considered those opportunities? And most of the time, the answer is no, because it's hard to see it at the moment. But I try to think about the potential of the business because I'm an early stage investor. I don't need all of it to be in place already. And so Bird Buddy is a digital birdhouse. It has a camera and a solar roof. So you put it in your backyard and it takes pictures of the birds that come and eat the seeds and small videos. And it also there's an eye layer to it where it actually recognizes the bird. So it's a very easy way to interact with nature and birds for you and your kids and grandparents. The initial idea actually came from Pokemon Go, either catch them all. Got to catch them all. Exactly. It's very easy to dismiss, but every time you talk to somebody, somebody buys it.
  Speaker 2
  It's such a like, I want to buy it. My dad is very fun with my kids.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, it's so fun. And it's a affordable entry price. And so you have this initial product and then okay, that's where you start. How much does it cost? It's your hundred and six, your 70, the entry price. I would get the solar roof because then you just don't need to charge it. Also, we now launched a subscription, which allows people that are really into birds to go into one of the other hundred and fifty thousand bird feeders that are already active out there And also to specific bird buddies in nature parks or in exotic locations in South Africa. And then we also have seasonal seed mix that gives you the seeds that attract the most interesting birds in that specific season. So you can start expanding from that. And then it becomes interesting if they talk about what if we are the place that helps you to increase biodiversity in your garden. Because we have already cameras, we see the movement of different animals. We can also complement that with different types of sensors for the soil, for how much sun the garden gets, what type of plants you have. And then we can actually sell you products that you need to increase biodiversity in your garden. And that is not just interesting for a lot of people that don't know how to garden, but it's also actually a very positive mission because if they do that properly, what type of influence Do you have to combat climate change? There's very limited room for you to do it. If there's a playful way for you to do it and get very easy recommendations to do that, and they participate in this, but also open that for you, it's a very rewarding thing to work on. For the employees there, for me as an investor, as the consumer supporting the business, I think it could be much bigger than people think.
  Speaker 2
  How often are you shocked by the market size? One of the things we talked about before was birding is an insanely common thing. And people spend tons of money on crazy binoculars and all this crazy stuff. Is this a common thing that you encounter where someone in an investor meeting is laughing them out of the room, but there's actually a billion people that like birds or something.
  Speaker 1
  It happens for sure. And actually that contrast of what you would expect instinctively. That's a really big argument for taking a close look. If we talked about speechify before, that was something for me that I was just so shocked how many kids have difficulty reading today and how little people read. Not just kids, also adults. It's so rare to find someone that actually still reads books. And for my perspective, I read as part of my process, it's part of my well-being to read. So it's hard for me to see that, but when something is so clearly different than what I expected, then it actually becomes, oh, this is really interesting. This tool here that Cliff, the founder of speechify, has dyslexia and he started it to help him do his homework for school and university. And so is that a singular case or how much does that expand? And then what is the mission? Because yes, you can help people with dyslexia and ADHD to process information, but you also actually are the bridge between everything that humanity has ever written to consume that Still when people don't actually read anymore. Actually, you could say that LMs are a bit of the same where they just agree at all that knowledge and then give it back to you in a schematic way. But this for me was, okay, there is a real problem here with people not reading. And most of humanity's knowledge is in text. And so speechify, the opportunity is much bigger, and the purpose of it is much beyond just people with dyslexia and ADHD of, let's keep building on the knowledge that we already have To push the adjacent forward.
  Speaker 2
  One of the things that must be a fun part of what you do for a living is that you get to use lots or all of the products. Try them yourself personally, versus infrastructure, software person, pretty rarely probably it's going to actually be building something with the tool or becomes very abstract. So you've looked at, God knows how many products yourself personally. How would you sum up what you've learned about what it means to be a great product? What the difference between a great and a good product or a 10 and a 9 or whatever frame helps you most think about the question. But you've seen a lot, you've developed taste, articulate that taste and what great means.
  Speaker 1
  A lot of it is simplicity of the product. It's actually usually doing very few things, but doing them super well, and not confusing people how to use it. And then it's an attention to detail about the different aspects of that journey that just make you realize that it's just very thought through by the founders. And so I think some of that is perhaps you can see by talking to users using it yourself and getting a feel for how smooth is it, what's the friction to getting started, and what's the time To having a wow factor. The first time you see a bird, I mean, there's a friction you have to buy the thing, put it in the garden. The first time you see it, you just immediately get the value. And so I think this is also true for calm is a good example. Obviously, you see a joke is you paid a subscription when 70% of it is silence. But the first time it forces you to sit down and meditate, you actually notice how much your mind is racing and how much you need it, because we all suffer from overthinking in the Western World. It's responsive for a lot of the depression and the problems that we have, I think. And so I think, for me, the process is somewhat intuitive, where I want to be drawn back to the product. I wanted to feel clear how you use it. I want the details to be thought through.
  Speaker 2
  And so the simplicity teaches you tha... ([Time 0:29:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8901928f-862e-48cf-97a0-dc2365cfea80))
    - **Note:** Just because you don’t understand a market doesn’t mean it can’t be massive. Likewise great products are very simple and really well crafted. What is specific usecase make as simple as possible. Be in adjacent possible non consensus and right. Understand why this opportunity is unique to you how you’ve changed your perspective over time. Be humble and adapt to the environment iterating self reflective to an opportunity trying to figure out what they’re building and they’re open to that.
- Laying the Foundation for Long-Term Success
  Summary:
  Companies often face a natural revenue ceiling with their initial product, which can be overcome through launching new products, acquiring others, or expanding the existing product.
  The key lies in understanding the market depth, user acquisition costs, and retention. To reach significant revenue benchmarks, companies need to evolve beyond their initial product by adding new functionalities or exploring different market segments.
  Setting the foundation for future acts early on is crucial to avoid stagnation and ensure sustained growth.
  By pushing for the expansion of products into second and third acts, companies can cater to diverse user needs and tap into new revenue streams.
  It's essential to strategically plan and build the necessary structure to transition smoothly from the initial product offering to a more diversified product portfolio.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Following those I think is exactly exploring the adjacent but what have you learned about Act 2 and beyond for these companies that you just said Evernote reached whatever was natural Ceiling of revenue and couldn't be a 10 billion dollar revenue company or something and that experience is doing something interesting with it what have you learned about the natural Caps of V1 product and when they need to go into their next act and any lessons there yeah definitely and as always I learn more every year with every company but currently I think that
  Speaker 1
  The first learning was that there is a natural ceiling this is true for SARS as well and a lot of people may I think dismiss the fact that a lot of SARS companies and launch new products acquire Other products and that then makes the revenue mix that actually is scalable usually that's new parts of the product that get added and consumer funds have to do the same thing the first Product that you put out is not the only product that you have forever and I think that's a shift in mindset where the ceiling that you reach is somewhat determined by the retention that You're seeing and the depth of the market and the cost that is acquiring a user out of those three pieces you have a natural ceiling and so you have to overcome ideally all three but like You have to work on all of them over time and so for me I have a pretty high confidence based on the investments I have done that there's certain benchmarks that if I see them I know that this Is a company that could get to a few hundred million of revenue if you come in at the seed on early A and you have a small fund that makes sense there's already enough there for it to work I Want to get better I want to help the founders and I want to further my understanding of what we're doing and like push also maybe the playbook and explore it and so I think that right now It's super important for me that the product itself lends itself to that expansion of act two and three so for consumer prosumer products for example I think very clearly the first act Is you have to consumer app you push it out second act is you begin to bring to web or another platform and then the third app is usually something that it could be an API it could also be just A more focused go to market around the enterprise and solutions that are not possible with the app itself and so I now because of what I've seen in some of the content focus subscription Apps is I try very early to push the urgency of we need to think about those things and put the foundation in place around what it could become for the room is a good example of that the first Email that I sent to material to CEO after I invested was actually do you think we could do an API around this and it was probably three years until we had customers but now we have and you Can go on the website but it's a very impressive list of customers that use footer room for marketing for scaling image and production and the best customer like Warner music 4500 companies Big brands that use it and there was no sign of that early on right you have to believe that so basically the underlying technology itself has to be strong enough to come through in different Surface areas the mobile component is the first of that and it's the easiest to scale it has reached 200 countries and you need a very small team to do it well but then from there you have To set the right foundation for the next acts early enough so that you overcome the ceiling before you reach it because you don't want to flatten out and then have to hustle to get the momentum Back and grow it but you basically try to put those things into place very strategically as you are getting to the hundred, million dollar revenue you already start working on those Things and so my role now is oftentimes just reminding founders that even though we're growing like crazy in this consumer, pro-sumer offering probably we're not going to get to billion Dollars in revenue maybe do you want to leave it to chance or do you just want to start putting in place some of the structure and foundation that allows the organization to go from this First offering to a second platform or a different product that bundles the same capability and technology in a different way to serve different use cases.
