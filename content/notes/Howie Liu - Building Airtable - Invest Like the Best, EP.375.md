- The Power of Customizable Platforms and AI in Workflow Automation
  Summary:
  Successful companies like Salesforce have thrived by offering highly customizable platforms rather than one-size-fits-all solutions.
  This approach allows customers to tailor software to their specific needs, a trend seen in companies like Atlassian with Jira. The integration of AI in app development and workflow processes is set to revolutionize the industry by automating tasks, streamlining operations, and enhancing decision-making.
  AI can assist in app creation by understanding customer requirements and building tailored solutions.
  Furthermore, AI-enabled apps can optimize workflow by suggesting strategies, content, or steps in a business process, ultimately improving efficiency and outcomes.

  Definitely true to a great degree and Salesforce is the case in point. So I think one of the eye-opening things about working at Salesforce. So I founded a previous company and went through YC. It was called E-Tax, personal CRM product. Long story short, after about a year, ended up getting aqua-hired by Salesforce. I specifically wanted to go there because I thought it would be a really great experience learning about enterprise software, B2B, just stuff that's hard to intuit from the outside, Unlike consumer. The big unlock for me, I literally felt like a light bulb moment, was realizing that Salesforce wins and has gotten to, I mean, now it's tens of billions, but at the time even, it was in The billions of revenue was not because they went and built the best possible CRM, all hard-coded into a prepackaged app, but rather that they built a platform. And with that platform, I mean, they had literally a metadata-driven application platform where every customer can customize the data schema. So you can add fields to your contacts, to your accounts, but also add new object types if you want. You can link between them. You can create logic on top of that. You can create a custom page layout and interface on top of that. And so ultimately, Salesforce is a big platform that won against the predecessor's seable or even positioned differently from SAP because the prior art was, let's just build a fairly Hard-coded solution and try to presumptuously guess, here's everything that you need for the best-in-class CRM or ERP. And Salesforce said, no, we're going to give you a template, a starting point, that codifies a lot of the best practices and a lot of the right shape of this data model and process. But ultimately, every customer is going to customize their own implementation. And so this idea of one size does not fit all. And in fact, every customer should be able to customize their own software has been true. And I think Salesforce has been proving that out. And I would generally say that most successful platform companies eventually get to that level of platform customizability, whether you are, I mean, Atlassian as well. Jira is actually also a very flexible, very customizable platform. Now both Jira and Salesforce may be fairly hard for the average layperson to customize. That's where we come in. But I do think we've been moving along this trend. And I think that AI will for sure accelerate it, both because A, the way that you build apps can be accelerated with AI. So being able to come into air table and say, hey, here's my exact use case. Here's where I work. Have it go and build a use case that's actually based on both external understanding of that customer. So if I worked at, let's say, Nike, there's a lot already on the public web about Nike and how their business works and what they care about from 10 case, that's already first of all pre Trained into the LMS and second of all can be prompted into the result. But you can do a lot to infer exactly how any given person within Nike wants to build out their use case and do it for them. That's a category A. And then I would say category B that's really exciting is using AI in the actual workflow. So not only can you use it to build the app in the first place, but as you use apps, you can build AI into the app so that their AI enabled apps, not just AI built apps. That's where the broad and deep capability of LMS really will come into play because I think you got to be really imaginative to find every single place in a business process where you Can introduce an LOM step in LOM capability to really automate something that would have taken a human hours and maybe even deliver a better result. If you're coming up with like a new marketing campaign, maybe the AI can actually at a certain step give you inspiration of the campaign strategy or even content. Here's a storyboard or like a concept or to represent the campaign that actually makes the human then go and take it to a better result.

    - **Note:** Giving people a platform to build and grow on top of. Sales force allows people to build an emergent platform. For AI don’t build fun tech but first solve the job needed to be done then abstract from there. The tech doesn’t matter if you’re not solving a problem.
- Evolution of Software Building: From Lego to Custom Solutions
  Summary:
  One of the key insights from the snip is the evolution of software building from providing abstract primitives like Legos to offering customized solutions and predefined templates.
  This shift from a purely Lego-kit model to assisting customers in building specific products like the Millennium Falcon or a castle kit highlights the importance of understanding user needs and providing tailored solutions. The emphasis has moved towards a blend of a flexible platform and structured applications to cater to diverse customer requirements.
  Additionally, the significance of having horizontal but deep platforms, AI integration throughout the product, and customizability at the core for enterprise and SMB software businesses are crucial aspects that investors should look for when considering investment opportunities.

  AirTable is founded in 2012, so it's been a while. A lot of things about both the philosophy and also the practical execution path that have evolved. I think what's consistent is we founded with this view of most software can be platformized or can be reduced into these building blocks of basically data model business logic and then A interface or workflow layer. And in a way, it's like saying, well, all software can be built on a model controller and view like, you know, MVC programming. So that's so true. And that was very much inspired by my own brief time at Salesforce where I got to see the power of their platform. And I think what's been a great learning opportunity for us is, well, that's good in theory. But in practice, people sometimes want more than just a very, very abstract blank slate. That's not even literally a blank canvas where they can just type into or draw on it. If you give them very, very abstract primitives, building blocks, sometimes they get stuck and they don't know how quite to build the thing they want. And so I think that's a place where we've learned a lot around giving people templates, giving people an onboarding journey, or how we engage with them if they're an enterprise is very Tailored around understanding their use case and then showing them rather than telling them how they can build towards their end state. And then having this co-participant model of we may be giving them some predefined templates or we may be helping them if we're doing a more high touch engagement, helping them along The way, but also having very much the customer participate in designing and even implementing what they want. So I think the evolution there has been from pure Lego kit. We just give you a bunch of Legos. It would be like, if Lego, the company, if they're only a basket, I remember you could buy like a big red bucket of all the parts. And it would be as if Lego never sold anything else. And in truth, we're starting to go to customers and say, hey, actually, do you want the Millennium Falcon or this castle kit? And we can help you build that. Or even here's a predefined template, a blueprint for how you would build that. And we are starting to do things around actually productizing solutions that like Salesforce and their solution, Sales CRM support CRM, etc. Are actually somewhere in between a template and a full app. There's going to be a little bit more structure to it. But at the same time, it's going to be built on the same underlying completely flexible platform that is almost infinitely accessible. I think finding that blend of its both platform and also application and solution. And the way that we engage with our customers is it has to be that flexible and adaptive as well has been the probably biggest evolution since the founding.

  So if you were to take everything you've learned about building and selling software, pretend I've just forced you to be an investor from this point forward, you're not allowed to run The business anymore, what would be your stack rank of variables or criteria that you'd be looking for in a marginal software business to get you excited to invest in it?
  Speaker 1
  So maybe going back to one of the earlier themes, I would definitely be a much bigger believer in generally horizontal but deep platforms as opposed to either vertical and narrow or Horizontal and shallow products. And to be frank, there's not that many of them out there. I think ultimately great businesses evolve there. I brought up Atlassian and Salesforce before. I think those are both products. In fact, Salesforce started out as a not customizable product. It was a true product. And it was very similar to a lot of the SMBC or M's you see out there today popping up. But pretty early on, I think a few years after their founding and getting some in their case, PLG, I mean, they were literally one of the first PLG companies on the web, they evolved to Having a much more flexible platform foundation. So I think that would be a table stakes requirement for my standpoint, because I think it's just so important in enterprise, especially, but probably also SMB, given just the diversity Of use cases, industries and company specific variations and how these processes are run and how the data model even should be defined. That customizability, having a platform model at its core would be a requirement. And then the second would really be how deeply is AI integrated, not just as a single feature, but rather, are they thinking about their product approach as well, most becoming now a Conduit for how do I make this product capable of deploying more and more AI into different parts of that workflow, that process, they have to be able to introduce AI, not just into a single Place, but into as many parts of that process, or ideally give the customer the ability to implement AI into as many parts of that process as possible.
