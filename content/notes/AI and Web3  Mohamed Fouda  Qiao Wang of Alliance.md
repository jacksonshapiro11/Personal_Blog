### Highlights

- How Auto GPT Works According to Podcast Participants
  Key takeaways:
  - Auto GPT utilizes two chat GPTs, with one telling the other what to do.
  - The first chat GPT gives a general direction, which the second chat GPT follows recursively.
  - The system can handle general goals, not just specific ones.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 3
  So the director's be as general as like, so Ryan, the way that this works with auto GPT, uh, I think I understand this from a high level is that you have, you almost have two chat GPTs. And one tells the other one what to do. And so it's like if you are using Chajibiti, except you replace yourself with Chajibiti and you give the originator, you give one Chajibiti is like, Hey, um, do a thing. Uh, book me a flight to, um, a country and then also get me a Uber and also a hotel and plan a plan of vacation. And then the, that will be the direction of one Chajibiti and that one second, with that first job, chat GPT will tell the second chat GPT to do all the things. And so it'll recursively iterate on itself until it gets to the goal. This is my understanding. Muhammad, is that right?
  Speaker 2
  Close enough. Yes. And actually, Ryan's response is the actual response. Like what's that?
  Speaker 1
  Yeah. Okay. So the goal can be this general can be like, it's not just, I was being way too specific and specialized. I think kind of dumb. ([Time 0:21:52](https://share.snipd.com/snip/da796b28-c7b3-4eb8-97c5-62b27c1590aa))
    - **Note:** Auto gpt. Give it a high level goal or directive and watch it iterate and improve on itself.
- Bank Accounts vs. Crypto Wallets for AI Agents
  Key takeaways:
  - An AI agent can theoretically control a bank account but faces unique problems compared to crypto wallets
  - Problems include KYC requirements and lack of permissionless interfaces in bank accounts
  - Crypto wallets solve both problems making them a better option for AI agents
  - Early bull cases for DeFi include Vance Spencer's episode
  Transcript:
  Speaker 4
  The key insight here is in theory, an AI agent can control a bank account, but there are two problems that are unique to bank accounts compared to crypto. One is, well, if you open a bank account, you need to KYC. Well, how does an AI agent KYC? That's impossible. And two, the interfaces are not permissionless in a bank account. So you can get the platform. If you have a bot that controls a bank account, but crypto solves both problems. So what's a better wallet for AI agent? Is it a bank account or is it a crypto wallet? That the answer is clear.
  Speaker 3
  One of the very early bull cases for DeFi, one of the earliest episodes was with Vance Spencer. ([Time 0:26:11](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0a8d29c3-be6c-42d3-a5f2-cd6d045220b9))
    - **Note:** A wallet is a great form factor for an Ai agent because it doesn’t need kyc and the stack is fully permissionless unlike the real banking sector.
- The Need for Marketplaces to Discover AI Agents in Crypto
  Key takeaways:
  - Marketplaces are needed to connect AI agents and create opportunities for investment.
  - AI agents using smart contracts are creating a banking and money system for robots.
  - There is a need for more understanding about the potential of AI agents in crypto.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  I think that this is again, like this, I agent also we need marketplaces to discover other AI agents. So like maybe there is opportunities and this is one of the investment opportunities that we are Polish about because we are thinking about that is that we need to create the market places where this Asian can discover each other and can be each other and can rank each other. And this is one of those and this is also a decent, as marketplace. So this is like there is a lot of investment in vegetable opportunities that come out from these pieces.
  Speaker 1
  I almost think, okay, so I don't think I was fully understanding, even though I've been in crypto, you know, I don't think I was fully understanding until you just described AI agents, what this is going to do for crypto, basically. I think what we have done in crypto, guys, is we have just created a banking and money system for the robots.
  Speaker 3
  Like that's, they are used to call them smart contracts, but now there's another level.
  Speaker 1
  But I'm talking about like agents, AI agents using all of the smart contracts. So if you're an AI agent, I mean, anybody who in the United States has tried to open a business, right anywhere and pay payroll across multiple states, knows what a nightmare it is to go register your LLC in kind of the meat space world and to figure out payroll taxes across all of these jurisdictions and figure out how to fill out the forms, right? They set everything up. ([Time 0:28:12](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4eb4fa12-cac7-449a-80e7-5eb2fead6129))
    - **Note:** We’ve created a system for ais to bank and live.
- Developers Building Tools for Image Authentication, Potential for Video
  Key takeaways:
  - Developers are already building tools to analyze changes made to images using zero knowledge proofs.
  - Similar projects may also be developed for analyzing videos.
  - Zero knowledge proof technology is still new and different use cases require specialized solutions.
  - Within one or two years, products using zero knowledge proofs may be commonly used without users needing to understand how they work.
  - Adding a small data attachment will allow clips to be verified and authenticated using zero knowledge proofs.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Yeah, there are developers already building that and there are already developers doing something on images right now that when you have an image and you rescale it or like you rotate it or whatever you do in touching up, it can prove that what you did in. It changed the content in a drastic way. I didn't take Ryan's face. I did about someone else. So we, there are project already building that. I think if any information is supporting one of the team on this regard, we are seeing actually teams that are trying to do this for video. We will see if we will do this and argue. There is a lot of ideas here and we will find the specialization because this zero knowledge proof is still a new technology and you need to find the most efficient roof system for your use case. So I think in the next one or two years, you will find any products actually addressing that so you can use it without even understanding that the key is under the hood. Anything, anyone who makes a clip of something will be just attaching a small data, which is a proof. And the burden goes to the person who publishes. If I publish something about a proof, we can't take it by default. That's fake until they publish the proof that this was taken from original content.
  Speaker 3
  I want to go, I'm so curious as to how this whole, how you can verify a clip of a larger set of data as a part of the larger set of data. I'm so confused about that. So say we had like a one hour long video and you had to take a one minute long clip. ([Time 0:47:08](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b7566b0c-f228-4948-a975-631f32e2f5d9))
    - **Note:** Publishing a zk proof with anything you produce to validate that you have authentically created this content
