- Insights on Sales and Hiring Successful Salespeople
  Summary:
  i'm fascinated by sales, because there's te the good, the bad and the ugly. And one of the things i did was very similar to what you did with a, taking the potential objection and putting it right up front. I would do my home work so i could guess what they were currently using, like salaris boxes or whatever. Then i would say, well, not suret if this is the right fit at all.

  A, with the sales. So i'm fascinated by sales, because there's te the good, the bad and the ugly. And you often see it within one industry, right? And a, so this brings back a lot of memories for me, because i was the the lowest paid, as a base sales person at the start that i worked for out of college. And they're like, hm, you're really persistent. You're in salesyou're really persistent. You have no technical background, you're in sales. Congratulation. Sounds like, ok, here we go. So, smiling, na, smiling and dialing yet. And one of the things i did was very similar to what you did with a, taking the potential objection and putting it right up front, which was, i'm the same as every other guy, yes, product, different label, same thing, except for this s which was the relationship piece. And i took a very similar approach when i was cold calling, which i did between, like, i want to say, like seven and eight and six and seven. So i avoided the times that the gate keeper would be manning the phones, yes, and only called when i thoughet i could get the higher ups who would yet work longer hours. But i would a, i would, i would do my home work so i could guess what they were currently using, like salaris boxes or whatever. S he i on ther se. And then i would say, well, not suret if this is the right fit at all. Ah, if you're using this type of system, this type system, or this type up system, it is not el, yes. Ah, and i would take all the potential weaknesses and just put them right up front. Ah, what you you, at that point, had already had experience hiring salespeople. How did you, what did you look for in salespeople? Or how did you, how did you hire the people wo had the highest likelihood of success or train them? Their ability to connect with other people and earn their trust, and what are the correlating a behaviors or qualities that allow them to do thatat they had to be genuine. ([Time 0:24:21](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f0a7ef4c-2a9c-4064-9fbe-82e422fda66f))
    - **Note:** Good salespeople build trust. They get infront of all the objections tell it to you like it is and give you what their differentiation is and it needs to be a combination of customer service and product differentiation. You need to hire people you genuinely trust.
- Is an MBA Worth It for Young Printers?
  Summary:
  i remember the very first case study we did in school was about these guys who were to cim up wo think of the new new golf ball that was better than of ther golf balls. And then we got together with the study group to talk about the case, and there were certain questions we wre tring to answer. I forget what they were. If someonei if one of your kids was considering getting an embia, ye, unless you say they were kind of of that age now, ye, what? What might you ask them?
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Eme, ask you this if you were counselling a young uch printer who was living somewhere they felt was, and i'm not saying you tags this place, except i've actually spent quite a bit of time there, but if they're living somewhere they feel doesn't allow them to surround themselves with other a highly ambitious, capable anc prunters, yes. And the only way that they could relocate was to get an mba, say, to chicago, new york. S f y, ah, do you think the hundred and 20 k, or whatever it might be, would be worth it? If so, if someonei if one of your kids was considering getting an embia, ye, unless you say they were kind of of that age now, ye, what? What might you ask them?
  Speaker 1
  So i remember the very first case study we did in school was about these guys who were to cim up wo think of the new new golf ball that was better than of ther golf balls. And it was about their struggle over two years pert of time, to work through patents and ip and gt distribution channels and stugh like that. And then we got together with the study group to talk about the case, and there were certain questions we wre tring to answer. I forget what they were.

    - **Note:** Get highly motivated people who want to work for a higher calling. Cultivate ambition and raise the bar. Core set or persistence and determination is much more important than anything you learn in an mba.
- The Importance of Operating Systems for World-Changing Innovation
  Summary:
  Every major change we've had t has been at this level. And so instead of playing with things at a different level, what we think about is companies that are doing world changing things at the operating system level. So if they're successful in their endeavor, it would radically change the world,.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  It is really a fascinating time. Amwe rave this cambrian explosion of potential. You know what? What happens when you can create virtually anything? Yes, you can down load a recipe for a a virus that could cause an epidemic, that's right. Or weapon, that's right. Or at the same time, obviously use that knife, that surgical knife, to repair or build, is suppose to damage, right? I what? Now, o s refers to operating system. Yes. Why? Operating system?
  Speaker 1
  So it's a metaphor i like a lot, that the biggest changes in history, the biggest improvements in history, have happened at what i call the operatin system level. So, for example, like germ theory, that we tried to figure out what was causing disease and death for a long time. Ad when we figured out t there ws a thing like bacteria that caused infections and death. And once we figured out sterilizations andtibiotics and vaccines and good personal hygiene, we radically extended healthy human life. But it was finding out there was this corpe problem of bacteria. And every major change we've had t has been at this level. And so instead of playing with things at a different level, a my what we think about is the companies we invest in are doing world changing things at the operating system level. So if they're successful in their endeavor, it would radically change the world, right? Tore the foundation, that's right, level upon which everything else that's right? ([Time 1:09:08](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ddba5817-5e3c-4652-b9fa-934d5fcbc6ca))
    - **Note:** The biggest changes happen deeper in the stack which gives you more leverage and reach in the change.
- Challenge All Assumptions
  Summary:
  CNN's John Sutter tells the story of five monkeys in a room. He says they learn to avoid being sprayed by cold water when trying to get bananas. The experiment is "horrible" but it provides valuable data, he says.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Yes, o braintree, one of the principles i consistently communicate it was challenge all assumptions. And the story that i accompanied with it was, there's five monkeys in a room. There's a basket of bananas at the top. And the monkeys, of course, want to climb the ladder to get the banana. But every time a monkey tries, they're all sprayed with cold water. And so after a few times being sprayed by cold water, the monkeys learn, don't climb up the ladder to get the bananas, going to spray by cold water. And so they take one monkey out and put er new monkey in. And the new monkey, of course, seese the bananas, is icalike, i mean, go grab a banana. But when it tries to go up the ladder, the other monkeys, grab it and pull it back. I don't want to spray by cold water. Your new guy hars o like, don't teach you the rules, exactly. So then they systematically pull every monkey out. Now you're five new monkeys in. Any time a new monkey comes in and tries to climb the ladder, they grab the monkey andpll it back. But none of the five have ever been sprayed by cold water, have ever experienced it, exactly. And so what i always try to wonder is, where is that in my life? What am i assumig that is invisible, that i cannot see?
  Speaker 2
  And of course, when the circumstances change. In a situation like that, you have learned helplessness. Rankly, i would say, take i mean, these are horrible experiments, but ultimately, the data, i think, is very valuable. Where they would have, say, i think it's a skinn er box that was used where they would subject animals to shocks. ([Time 1:20:06](https://share.snipd.com/snip/233a9181-69a1-47bc-90ad-f1b37321e956))
    - **Note:** Question all assumptions in what area of your life do you do something to do something without realizing why you’re doing it b
- Are You an Entrepreneur?
  Key takeaways:
  - Oncpaners are explorers who chart new territory and maintain order in chaotic situations to achieve a goal.
  - Practices that help oncpaners develop these characteristics include being willing to risk failure and investing during recessions.
  - Individuals who are likely to be successful as oncpaners are those who are risk intolerant and have a burning desire to achieve something.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  So what do you think an ancprinter is? What is an onch printer?
  Speaker 1
  Someone willingtoikm, i think oncpaners and explorers have a lot in common ti shackleton, that they chart tha, they head off in uncharted territory, and they maintain this ability to adapt to circumstances that are chaotic, unknown and extremely challenging. And they can maintain some order in all the chaos to actually achieve a goal.
  Speaker 2
  What are practices, experiments maybe, that people could perform to help them develop those characteristics? Is there nything else that you find t reports? Well, over to that chaotic, uncertain nature of start ups, small companies.
  Speaker 1
  So i guess we, i have a lot of conversations with people who want to start their own thing, and one of my favorite questions to ask is, is this an itch, or is it a burning right? Sov it's just an itch. It's not sufficient. And it gets to the point of, how badly do you really want it? And for me, i burned the boats like there was no way i was going to get a job. And so failure was never an option. I had to make this work. And i did have jobs ong the way, but that was just simply to pay the bills. But a failure just wasn't a solution i would accept. And so i think i want to get at anchpaners that, how badly do you want itd, what will you do to get there?
  Speaker 2
  E, i find it very difficult in the current environment to identify those people, because things are so frothy right now, a lot of people who would otherwise be risk intolerant and fearful of uncertainty are jumping into the fray as founders. Mean, you have in this look, a lot of my very close friends come out of mackenzie in places like that. But when people with very high payn consult consulting jobs are then jumping into start ups, i start to wonder what, what is on the what is on the horizon? And if i look back, a very kind of mackerel timing way to at least narrow down the field a bit so it's easier to find those people seemd to be investing during recessions. So i sort of investing right after crashes. It left sort of t people who couldn't conceive of doing anything else standing on the playing field. Yes. And this sort of fair weather investors, the fair weather antrpeners, all went back to doing whatever they perceived to be ye charted territory.
  Speaker 1
  Exactly me. I guess. I i wanto be careful, like, ido't want to be like an entrapnure definition snob, i writ and suggest that. I was going to come out and pesa at you about that, butbut, me, like these attributes are held by people within companies, who are starting their companies, who are working with larger institutions. But it's, it's u it's just inherently people who can create do and see what others cannot or will not do, that they will blaze something ta others will follow or benefit from. ([Time 1:34:07](https://share.snipd.com/snip/397bbd7b-910d-4e8d-b299-6c3e898b792f))
    - **Note:** Are you willing to burn the boats. Do what others won’t.
