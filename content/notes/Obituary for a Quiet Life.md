### Highlights

- What Ray Harrell had was a reliable tractor and a fiery woman. He had a pat of cornbread waiting at noon dinner and an RC Cola every night before bed. He had kids and grandkids and great-grandkids enough to fill the house every Christmas. And that was plenty. “We’ve had a good life,” he said to me nearly every time I visited in his final year, and I knew it to be true even if it might have seemed odd from a distance. On paper, this small life above Clear Creek should have left a long list of regrets, of *what ifs*. But this life was *the* life, the very thing he and my grandmother Grace set out to make when they married in the little church up the road in 1954.

- Maybe that was right, too, but as I pieced together these stories of seeing the world and fighting back against injustice, I realized that a quiet life isn’t a passive life. Sitting still on the porch doesn’t mean letting the world go by. He and Grandma took their camper across the country. He served as president of the union. Being content doesn’t mean being blind. It means knowing the difference between a good fight and a selfish one.
  “I believe in standing up for what is right,” he said between bites of corn. “And I oughtn’t say this, but everybody liked me.”
  “Why?” Grandma asked.
  “I wouldn’t have thought you’d have to ask that. I’m a good old boy.”

  > ***The best time of his life was when his girls were little, Ray said as he neared the end. He and Grace raised two daughters: Joy (pictured left) and Debbie.*** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw1rwgtty9008sgr93ayhc9x))

- A month before he passed, faded and worn down to a wheelchair, his head still popped up when Grandma walked into the kitchen: “Hey thar, pretty girl.” 
  The morning after Grandma called me, I took my boys by to see Papaw for the last time. He’d been unresponsive for a day, but when we entered the bedroom, he was awake again. He couldn’t find his voice — he’d been breathing through his mouth, and his throat was too dry to speak up — so I leaned in. He looked to my sons and said, “Hey, fellers.”
  They waved. 
  “I love you,” I told him.
  “Love you, buddy,” he whispered. 
  “You done good,” I said because that’s how he would’ve said it, but also because that’s how I meant it. He’d done so much good, even if it couldn’t be listed on official records or captured in the stat sheet of an obituary. The good of his life was ever-rippling water, quiet and steady, and my boys and I would long be swept up in it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw1s25cxdfqesy4n3te7dkrh))

    - **Note:** We truly are always that young child inside never fully grown up always looking forward saying goodbye at the end of a life and a life well lived. Amazing how life can pass and run but life comes for us all. Resume vs eulogy virtues
