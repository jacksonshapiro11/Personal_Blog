### Highlights

- I HATE COMMITTES + importance of DOING testing yourself!
  Key takeaways:
  - Ken hated committees because they were a waste of time and they didn't do anything useful.
  - It is important to get your own firsthand experience in order to develop new ideas.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  This is why Ken hates committees. He does a lot of work for the country in both World War I and World War II. So during World War I, the army or the military has an issue. There's this thing called knock. It happens in engines and cars, but it's also happening in engines and planes. And so through trial and error, he discovers, hey, gasoline, for whatever reason, gasoline that's produced in California causes the engine to knock less than gasoline that is used from that is created in Pennsylvania. So he tells them the result of his experiments, but they, the committees doesn't agree. That's what it says. It was accordingly suggested that California gasoline be used as fuel for airplanes flown in combat. But unfortunately, there was a wartime committee which turned down the recommendation. Recommendation is not practical. I think it's the definition of practical, actually. It was this frustrating experience and several others, which cuttering had with committees, acting on progressive ideas that caused him to say later. If you want to iron a thing down to the most simple, commonplace, low form of mediocrity, what a committee to pick the flaws in it. Why? Because there isn't one man in a thousand who has any imagination. When 10, now he's going to give a, this is a great story that illustrates his opinion on this matter. Ten years afterward, when his wife read about Charles Lindbergh's solo flight across the Atlantic, she said to her husband, how wonderful that he did it all alone. It would, and this is cat's reply to Larry's. It would have still been more wonderful if he had done it with a committee. And so, cat has this philosophy. I love this idea he says, and this is very similar to a lot of, like Henry Ford would say something similar. We find that in research, a certain amount of intelligent ignorance is essential to progress. For if you know too much, you won't try the thing. This is cat on the importance of first-hand experience. It may seem strange that with all his responsibilities and with as, as much capable of help as he had, cat would devote so much of his own time to road testing, meaning driving the automobile to make sure that what he fixed is actually fixed. It was done in the exercise of his belief that it is a mistake for any person engaged in research to leave the practicing of it, the practicing of it altogether to others. It takes personal practice to drive delusions out of a fellow's mind, he said, in an illustration of this belief he once told this story. I was running some tests off the coast of Florida in connection with automatic steering devices for small boats. And when the weather was bad, I used to work out there every day from about 9 in the morning to about 3 or 4 in the afternoon. The test had to be run in bad weather because we couldn't find out anything in good weather. Some friends of mine down there for a vacation said, we think you're crazy running that little boat up and down in the stormy golf stream all day long. Why don't you get somebody else to do that for you? One of those men happened to be a very good golfer and the other was an excellent violinist. So I said, I'll tell you what I'll do. You fellows get somebody to play your golf game for you and to practice your fiddle for you. If you find that works, let me know and I will get somebody to ride that boat for me. Right now I do not know how anybody else could get my first-hand experience for me. One of the fundamental principles of Cass life was the fact that he would, you know, he'd veer off the path. If you believe that there's more things that we don't know than we do know, then just traveling on a well-worn path is not the way to discover new things. And so what was interesting is he applied this even in his travel. So he's talking to this person. They both have to drive back from Dayton to Detroit quite a bit. And at the time, Route 25 was like the main highway to do so. And so, Kat tells him, you know, I can get there, whatever. I think it's like four. The guy says you couldn't make the drive in four hours. And Kat says, well, I do make it in four hours. And so he's like, all right, I'm going to ride with you next time you do this because I want to see how you do this because you're doing it so much faster. I'm so says often Kettering used this story to emphasize to young people and others the importance of getting off the beaten track, especially if one is to be successful in developing new things. Invention, he would say, is nothing more than getting off Route 25. So what this guy discovers is when he's riding with Kat, this guy would stay on Route 25 all the time. So it takes him, you know, six hours, seven hours, whatever it was. Ket discovered to trial and error that there's you get on and off Route 25 and you can get there faster. And so he uses that as an illustration. And it's like, okay, it's the same thing when you're trying to do new things. Kat was a master salesman, not because necessary he wanted to, even though it does have, you know, extreme practical uses in life. But because he understood that the hardest job in life is selling you ideas. ([Time 0:49:43](https://share.snipd.com/snip/bb0a29be-b0b6-4033-a73c-44fac1ca814d))
