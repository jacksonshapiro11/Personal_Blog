  Speaker 1
  I've spent a bunch of time with them if you schedule a demo So if you go to Vesta calm and schedule a demo you actually speak directly to the founder Ben I think he's incredibly impressive And I think if you speak to him you'll be impressed to make sure that you tell him that David from founders Sent you and with that let's jump into the episode actually read two books to make This episode. I hope you enjoy it One plan no matter how well laid out couldn't possibly respond to all of these situations This is why Kelleher does not put much stock in traditional strategic planning. He explains it this way Reality is chaotic planning is ordered and logical the two don't square well with one another When us air pulls out of six cities in California They don't call Me and tell me they're gonna do that now if we had to establish a big strategic plan that is approved by our Officers and the board of directors I would have to go to the officers and the board And tell them that we want to deviate from this plan They would want to know why I want to buy six more airplanes The problem is we'd analyze it and debate its merits for three months instead Of getting the airplanes taking over the gates and Dominating California the meticulous nitpicking that goes on in most strategic planning processes creates a mental straight jacket That becomes disabling in an industry where things change radically from one day to the next When a financial analyst chided Kelleher about not having a strategic plan He said we do Have a plan. It's called doing things That is an excerpt from one of the two books that I'm going to talk to you about today That is from nuts Southwest Airlines crazy recipe for business and personal Success That was written by Kevin and Jackie Freeburg the other book is called Herbs Heroes and was written by pilot that worked at Southwest for 37 years. I have not been able to find a comprehensive biography on her Kelleher. I think one should exist I think he's an extra he was an extraordinary person a gifted entrepreneur He built the most successful airline in history, which we'll get into today So to make This episode I used these two books I reread this the second time I read the nuts book But I use these two books and I took notes on interviews that Herb did when he was alive So what I'm going To do first is I summarized all of my notes from the book Herbs Heroes I just want to go over that outline which I think will give you a good overview as to the type of person Herb was and why He was that way So he's born during the Great Depression his father worked in a soup factory Herbs older brother was killed in World War two Herb is ten years old at this time after his brother Dies his father dies unexpectedly the year after and then within a few years of that happening herbs to surviving older siblings move away for college So now Herb grows up the second Half of his childhood is just him and his widowed mom And so her influence and the lessons that his mom taught him he uses his entire life including in building his company So they would Have late night talks almost every night at the kitchen table and even when he was a kid They're staying up to like two in the morning and she's teaching Herb about life And one of the most Important things that she did was she taught him that adversity is a normal way of life This is a woman that lost her son lost her husband and yet there was no self-pity whatsoever She said That stress and difficult times was not deabilitating but opportunities to excel and achieve And so even from a young age he starts to find problem-solving Invigorating the reason I've always admired her admired Herb I've tried to consume as much information about him as possible and the reason it came to the top of my mind to make an episode about him right now is Because I was reminded of Something that he said during a talk and this came many years later in his life He's already been working on Southwest for multiple decades at the time and he Was asked you undergo a lot of stress all the time How do you handle it and his response is perfect? He said I don't handle it I like it and so that's a maximum that I want to repeat to myself as we're building our company's difficulties and hard times are inevitable And I'm just gonna Remind myself. I don't handle my stress I like it it completely changes your mindset into like this isn't something I have to do it's something I get to do Back to his early life. He was a gifted athlete in high school He ran track played basketball and football and leadred in all three sports before college He works at the very same soup factory that his dad had Worked at and he worked there for six years He did every single job at the factory. This is something he's gonna continue to do at Southwest Which we'll talk about later, but this is why I'm telling you this he called his six years working in a soup factory Right? This is a guy that's going to go on to to he's really gets it everything does gifted athletics He's really good at college gets a law degree clerks for the Supreme Court has a successful Law practice then at 35 with four kids Decides hey, I'm gonna be an entrepreneur. I'm gonna try to run I'm gonna try to start an interest state airline in Texas And so with all that the fact that he said the six years at the soup factory doing every single job He called It the best education he ever had and so even when he was younger and then throughout his entire career People say the same thing about him over and over again They describe him as a fierce Competitor and they said he had a hard work ethic That is a quote a hard work ethic He was working a hundred hour weeks at the beginning of Southwest because he still had to practice law To pay the bills It took them four and a half years between the time they raised money for the company They start the company and then they're actually allowed to fly their first flight Another thing about Herb He was old school. He was hard driving hard drinking fast living Texan. He started every day early Regardless of how late he was helped the night before drinking this is gonna come up over and over again another crazy thing He smoked five packs a cigarettes A day and drink wild turkey bourbon every day He said wild turkey and fill up more cigarettes are essential to the maintenance of human life When he was in his 60s He fought and beat prostate Cancer and then he was asked if he thought his smoking habit contributed to his cancer And he said I do not smoke with my prostate. He lived until he was 87... ([Time 0:02:14](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6fa95796-3ef5-45e3-813d-654f03bf874f))
    - **Note:** Strategic plans slow progress you need a vision and steer the boat daily. When things change you need to act fast and decisively you can’t have 3 months of strategic planning you need to make ballsy calls off the cuff. Herb had his oldest brother die in war his dad die young and his brothers move out so it was just him and his mom. She taught him about the power of adversity. Adversity isn’t something you have to overcome it’s something you get to overcome. Adversity was fun to herb. His mom and him lived together and her unwillingness to give into self pity shaper herb. He started at a soup factory at 17 where his dad worked. Worked every job very mentally flexible works as a clerk in the Supreme Court than at 35 married with kids he decided to start an airline. Fierce competitor with crazy work ethic fast driving and drinking hard living Texan. Worked 100 hours the first 4 years before they even flew he had no outside money raised. Saw the 6 years at the soup factory as the best education of his career. He was very cost focused and southwest was profitable for 47 years the next longest run by an airline was 5. He felt he was born to be an entrepreneur and derived purpose from this. Smoked 5 packs a day and drank wild turkey every day. If you’re crazy enough to do what you love you’re bound to life a life that matters.

  He was profitable for 47 straight years the next most successful airline was profitable for five and when you read about herb or if you listen to his interviews like he's hilarious So And he says like I don't take myself too seriously But I take competition very seriously Unsurprisingly one of herbs favorite people was Winston Churchill who quote Churchill all The time He'll use Churchill's ideas and talks and speeches to his employees and to his team One of his innate talents that jumps out if you read a book about him is the fact that he was able To operate on very little Sleep, there's a lot of stories in both books about the fact that he'll be out drink until like 3 in the morning And then he'll be at the office at like 7 a.m He also Talks a lot about and repeats the importance of having a business model that endures the hard times Talks about most of the airlines are set up though reap a bunch of profits in good times And then yet they give it all back when the inevitable downturn happens And so one thing he talks about is like listen We'll joke around we'll have a lot of fun. We're very extravagant in our marketing But we're very physically Conservative we're conservative with debt they paid for 80% of their planes out of earnings most other airlines Are borrowing that money They own the largest amount of planes outright than any other airline and the quote that came to mind when I was reading about herbs Financial approach to building This company is this fantastic quote from Charles the gall where he said all that matters is to survive The rest is just words Herb was also a gifted storyteller and he was very persuasive. He was not building a company He was leading people on a crusade. He was not hiring employees. He was converting missionaries He says our indomitable dedication is the core of our success That is the most difficult thing for a competitor to imitate They can buy all the physical Things that we have the things that you can't buy or dedication ([Time 0:08:39](https://share.snipd.com/snip/49130ee8-723d-4b01-b973-248a971357a5))
    - **Note:** He was a missionary not a mercenary. He believed he was on a crusade and didn’t use debt but bought things with cash leading to less fragility in bad times but less booms. Independent thinking. First survive. Herb was a voracious reader gifted story teller and service/customer focused. Read history to learn from others and would lead from the front. On thanksgiving eve the busiest day of the year he was on the tarmac unloading bags. He did this in his mid 30s with a family because he wanted to do something different. He sees the model work on California with fast growing cities to far for a bus and saw an opportunity to grow through cheap air travel that didn’t yet exist but had a model in Cali. Had to fight through curroption and regulations. Sees life as a grand epic he had to appeal to fly to Texas aviation it got taken to 2 courts and turned down they lost all their $500k in seed money in fees and they were done. Herb said he’d represent the company himself and pay all fees out of pocket to defend the free market that he thought was being bastardized takes it to the tx Supreme Court and wins. He loved competition and hated losing.

  Go bankrupt Herb buys his airline, but that's many years into the future Let's go back to this so the Texas Supreme Court says hey, you know, you cannot enforce this injunction Kelleher Then calls Muse on the full phone and says put the planes in the air when Muse confided to Kelleher that he was still Concerned about a sheriff showing up to enforce the injunction Kelleher Didn't mince any words I told him you roll right over that son of a bitch and leave our tire tracks on his uniform if you have to the very next day June 18th 1971 Southwest Airlines was finally Off the ground and so this is the first mention of something that repeats over and over again The fact that Herb was a master at turning things into a cause so it says the seemingly insurmountable Obstacles thrown at sir Southwest or what created Kelleher's passionate love for the airline They would put 12 or 15 lawyers on a case and on our side there was just Herb They almost wore Him down to the ground, but the more arrogant they were the more determined Herb got This airline was gonna go into the air and stay there He said Herb is a master at turning things into A cause it was an affront to my idealism He said if you're gonna let these guys get away with this It is a radically different type of country than the one I want to believe in and he wasn't Making all this up His competitors were out to get Southwest and they were willing to break the law to do so Four years later both Braniff and Texas International were actually indicted By the US government for conspiring to put Southwest out of business and for violating the Sherman Antitrust Act in addition to suing them at every single court They also would behind The scenes would chase Southwest and vase investment bankers out of their underwriting syndicate when they were trying to IPO They would go to Southwest vendors and convince them To boycott and not sell to Southwest They tried to keep Southwest from using the fuel hydrant system at Houston's airport And they successfully got Southwest blackbald from membership In the airline credit card system to all of these charges both companies pleaded no contest Okay, so one Southwest is up and running you'll see that a lot of the innovations were forced Upon them Necessities the mother of ([Time 0:17:43](https://share.snipd.com/snip/457bea7f-e1a8-4bbc-8377-48994ad387fb))
    - **Note:** Herb literally fights himself for this company to stay alive and wins constantly he was doing this on the side and running his law practice full time. Herb made the insurmountable possible. His competitors were out to get him and pled no contest in an anti trust case. They did everything possible to sabotage southwest. Resource constrained so they decided to innovate. They deeply questioned assumptions because they had to. The industry had 2 groups people could fly and people who couldn’t afford it herb lowered costs and attacked the 2nd segment. Questioned fundamental assumptions they doubled the market with this strategy they innovated through trial and error and when people failed herb didn’t fire them he accepted as a cost of innovation most of their success comes from this culture of freedom to make mistakes. They found the niche of short haul business travelers then found they had to send flights back with no passengers so decided to offer cheap flights on off hours to see what happened it was better than nothing. This helped them discover leasure travel which flew on the weekends and they charged half price and this created a massive market out of nothing.

  Speaker 1
  One of the most widely emulated marketing innovations in airline history system wide peak and off peak pricing and So this idea was so successful that their main competitor Braniff Immediately copied them right and this is hilarious because in In this one of his interviews He talked about the fact that one of his competitors lowered prices and called it an introductory Fair even though they had been Business for 40 years and serving the exact same markets for 40 years And so this is what I mean about having forced like they're just Unbelievably creative And open to all kinds of new ideas So they went up keeping their prices the same and then told customers if you pay a higher fair We'll give you a free bottle of whiskey and so for a few months. They became the largest liquor distributor in the state of Texas Well, so and this is the important part they taught they went directly to their customers and explained to them what Was going on The fact that hey this bigger existing competitor with a lot more resources. They're trying to put us out of business This is not gonna be good for you. This is if you ever studied David Ogilvy He talks about the silver nerve again and Claude Hopkins the probably the best copywriter in history that you tell the truth in your ads Speak One person to another tell the people why you're doing what you're doing The truth will resonate with the buying public and they may act in ways that surprise you here is an example of That So it says the ad explained how Braniff was trying to put Southwest out of business and then went on to say the Southwest Would not only match Braniff's fair. It would also every offer every passenger a choice Travelers could choose the $13 fair. So this is during the week, right? They're taking her off peak price and temporarily putting it during peak, right? So it says hey listen that's fine. We'll match them But here's why they're doing what they're doing now We also have an idea for you travelers could choose the $13 fair or buy a regular $26 ticket and receive a complimentary Bottle of alcohol so you can choose from scotch whiskey or vodka now Why is this going to work who is traveling during the week? These are business travelers They are not paying for their own ticket business travelers loved it They could charge a $26 fair to their expense accounts and go home with a free bottle Of liquor for a few month period Southwest was the largest distributor of alcohol in the state of Texas to Braniff's dismay 76% of Southwest passengers paid the $26 and took the gift Tell the truth in your ads communicate person to person tell them what you're doing This is a result two years later Braniff terminated its Dallas Houston hobby airport service This Is the route that they were competing on Braniff thought they were gonna run Southwest out of business off this route and in turn they ran themselves out of business off this route And So now we go into more principles that her built Southwest with first is you should know your niche better than anybody else So he starts this with asking and making sure everybody in Your company asks and knows What is your fundamental reason for being? Why does your company exist when you identify that make sure everybody else knows it and then stick to it? And here's why when you have a vision and someone comes to you with some convoluted idea You can hold it up to the vision and ask does it fit if not don't bother me Southwest exercises the Discipline not to stray from its strategy It does not for example buy jumbo jets fly international routes or go head-to-head with a major carriers Just talking about the difference In their behavior compared with every single at this point every single other Competitive they have while other carriers have been lured by the temptation to step outside their niche ([Time 0:25:19](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a5b53311-4ba6-49cb-a33a-8523d8da1462))
    - **Note:** Tell the truth in your ads southwest had a competitor that fast followed and southwest decided to give an offer of $13 ticket or $26 ticket and free booze most travelers were business and expensing it chose the booze and southwest became the largest liquor distributor in Texas for a time. Southwest drive the competitor out of business who tried to disrupt them. Good marketing direct to customers. They knew their niche and framed everything in that vein this helped them evaluate business decisions if it fit the dna they did it if not they moved past it. They didn’t want market share but profit so they didn’t worry about market share but profit saw the history of the industry cared about the other stuff and consistently went bankrupt. He knew his competition wasn’t other airlines but cars so while airliners were charging 6x for the same route he didn’t because he knew they weren’t his competition. Cost focused above all. Flew only 737s to limit complexity and lower costs. This allowed them to have cheaper better training hired 50% fewer workers. This cut costs dramatically. Peer companies will mindlessly imitate you.
- Southwest Airlines' Strategy of Knowing What They Do Best
  Key takeaways:
  - The behavior of pure companies is often mindlessly imitated by others, even if it doesn't make sense.
  - Southwest Airlines focused on finding cost-effective solutions to problems rather than blindly following industry norms.
  - Success can breed complacency and vulnerability, so it's important to avoid complacency, greediness, laziness, and indifference.
  - Southwest Airlines prioritizes profitability and job security over other metrics like fleet size or destination variety.
  - Maintaining flexibility allows Southwest Airlines to quickly seize individual opportunities as they arise.
  - Southwest Airlines capitalized on an opportunity to acquire gates from a bankrupt airline by swiftly negotiating a deal and beginning operations immediately.
  - Future scenario generation meetings help Southwest Airlines anticipate and prepare for potential challenges and opportunities.

  The behavior of pure companies is just going to be imitated In fact, there's a great line about this in Warren Buffett shareholder letters. I'm gonna read it to you real quick He says the behavior of pure companies whether they are expanding acquiring setting executive compensation or whatever Will be Mindlessly imitated You have to remember that because what happens they have a problem. Oh, man. We have people are throwing away their their tickets What's the solution and so they go around like well? What is everybody else doing? They're using these super expensive multi layered airline ticket systems We'll just go out and buy one of that. That is our solution So it says an obvious alternative we should buy a multi million dollar system that produced a traditional multi layered Airline ticket in other words. Let's mindlessly imitate the behavior of our peer companies Somebody spoke up in the in the meeting. They're like that doesn't make any sense There has to be a cheaper way to solve the problem that's spending two million dollars And so he said why don't we just print this is a ticket in Big bold red letters on the receipt instead of spending two million Dollars to follow the rest of the industry Southwest modified its ticket stock with the caption and it worked and The people inside and outside your company come up with this Because they all know what they do best. They know their niche They know the importance of having the lowest cost structure possible And so this is something that Keller will repeat over and over again The way I think about This is like the max my use of my own life is if you go to sleep on a win You'll wake up with the loss. Keller has said on many occasions a company is never more vulnerable to complacency Then when it's at the height of its success the number one threat is us. He would say we must not let success breed complacency Cockiness greediness laziness indifference Preoccupation with non essentials bureaucracy or hierarchy We will let our niche Define how we operate and this is what he says. We don't care whether we fly to Paris We don't care whether we have a 747 What we're focused on is being profitable and job secure if people didn't pay much attention to Southwest Airlines Because it appeared to be a much smaller Regional carrier it was just immaterial to us We set ourselves up to go into a specific niche and the heading he uses to describe the idea of what He's talking about is know What you do best? He elaborates on this idea a few pages later We never try to be like other airlines. Keller heard said from the very beginning. We told our people question it Challenge it remember decades of conventional wisdom has led the airline industry into massive losses So you and I talked at the very beginning if you Looked at how Herb Keller ran his company He was individual opportunity driven to use another line from Buffett and he said that reality is chaotic and that planning is orderly and logical And the two don't square well with another and the fact that US air you know if they're gonna go out of Business and have six planes for sale and some gates that Southwest can take over they Don't call him and tell them before him So the Keller has this like fierce hate It's just like for bureaucracy and he prefers flexibility and maintaining that flexibility is what allows Him to go after these individual opportunities as they appear and so here's another example of that the Southwest team arrived at midnight they just flown into Chicago from Texas and Turned on the televisions in the hotel rooms just in time to hear Midway airlines announced that it was out of cash and closing its doors Confirming the rumors that had brought them to Chicago on this sudden trip Speed another thing that Herb would optimize for they pounce on deals quickly and they closed deals quickly So that happens the night before at midnight The night before the rumors confirmed 9 a.m. The next morning Southwest team started negotiating with city officials in Chicago for the use of the bankrupt airlines gates By 2 30 that afternoon they hammered out a deal. They agreed They'd give them 20 million dollars to have immediate use of the gates by 3 p.m. There's a press conference with the mayor of Chicago to announce the deal with Southwest There's a great question that happens at this press conference a reporter asks when Chicago Could expect to see some sign of Southwest's commitment to the expansion the reply go to the airport. You'll see it right now Southwest had already gone to the gates started installing their computers started rebuilding the podiums And then started putting up their signs right over The top of the midway airlines signs The company was able to capitalize on this opportunity because Southwest was in the words of their COO nimble quick and opportunistic and so this Next quote from Bill Gates actually Combines two of these ideas that is a main Reoccurring theme in the life and the career and in this book of Herb Keller the fact that he wants to be flexible So he can adapt to new opportunities as they arise and he wants to spend time learning from history So he could avoid their mistakes and this is what Bill Gates says in this book when we Look back at the last 20 years It is obvious that a number of large companies were so set in their ways that they did not adapt properly and lost out as a result 20 years from now will look Back and we'll see the same pattern and So one practice that helps Southwest be opportunistic and be individual opportunities driven is they have these meetings that they call future Scenario Generation and essentially just getting a bunch of people in a room and just asking a bunch of what if questions and trying to say hey What if this hypothetical scenario happens? How would we respond Southwest prepares for the future by practicing the art of what if? Future scenario generation is the technical name for this process They create future scenarios in which the airline could find itself these situations include a lot of what if questions? What if we open one or two new cities in New England area? How will the competition respond? What if Chicago builds a new airport? How many airplanes will we need and where will we get them? How will this affect the business the result of these discussions is a set of multiple plans that reduces the likelihood that Southwest would get caught off guard?

So having this meeting in January He's saying the commercial could be scripted by March script approval could be completed in April 30 days to approve a script Good God the casting would Happen in June I don't know what the hell they did for those two months and the company could start shooting in September What are you doing when Valentine finished outlining his schedule Kelleher said Don I hate to tell you but we're talking about next Wednesday The new vice president quickly became accustomed to the speed with which Southwest operates This guy came In and thought nine months away was fine and Kelleher's like no, dude You got six days nine months is way too slow And so let's go back to another reoccurring belief that Herb Kelleher Had the fact that you should take your competition very seriously In fact, he would imbibe his company directors with a lot of like Winston Churchill References he talked about wanting A his company to have a battle of Britain kind of mentality And he was constantly hammering this fact that success must be earned over and over again or it disappears You go to sleep on A win you'll wake up with a loss And so they have this giant the biggest airline in the world now taking aim at them And so he writes this letter to all of his employees and he called it commencement Of hostilities And it says these excerpts show the intensity with which he can create a sense of urgency now This is Herb talking United Airlines has become the largest airline in the World seven times the size of Southwest The world's largest airline has recently announced that it will launch its initial direct assault against Southwest in the Western part of Our route system The initial attack will utilize 25 new planes an additional hundred airplanes are in reserve to be hurled against us at a later date United has on hand over a billion Dollars in cash Southwest has nowhere near that at this point So he says our stock price our wages our benefits our job security our expansion opportunities and foremost our pride of Accomplishment As one of the nation's best airlines are all on the line at its beginning Southwest routed Branniff Trans Texas and continental with three airplanes Southwest can Thwart United's actions against us with our 200 airplanes the crucial elements are the vigor the dedication the energy the unity and the devotion to warm hospitable caring and loving Customer service of all of our people Winston Churchill stated success is never final indeed Success must be earned over and over again or disappears I am betting on your minds your Hearts your souls your spirits to continue our success Let's win this one and make aviation history Again, and you see that color realizes that it's really important to use memorable Language I'm sure you've read a bunch of letters from the CEO of the founder. That's boring as hell that There's a lot of things, but it's not boring So he constantly over and over again There's a ton of examples of Herb intentionally using memorable language And then I just love this story really it talks about the benefits of curiosity the fact that the benefits of curiosity are unpredictable And if you read a lot your life will just be more Interesting as a result. You also be better at your job I don't know it's such a low-hanging fruit. It's amazing Keller is a voracious reader who digs deeply into issues to understand them thoroughly It is not unlike him to go on a book buying binge and spend four or five hundred dollars At his favorite bookstore When his son David was studying physics in college Keller started reading up on the subject so the two of them could converse Keller her once bought a 300 page History of Richmond, Virginia and read it before speaking there So he's going to speak in an event. What does he do? He reads an entire 300 page history before he goes to this area and this is the result He ends up having dinner at some old-line Virginians home talking about the history of Richmond They Go around the city and Herb is pointing out places of historical importance. He didn't do it to show off He did it because he was going to a new place and he loves history And on the very same page is a great quote the illiterate of the future will not be the person who Cannot read It will be the person who does not know how to learn And after more than 20 years of running a successful profitable company Keller was asked if he had any advice for other chief Executive officers his reply Spend more time with your people and less time with other CEOs Armato was only the strong survive because our balance sheet was conservative because our Operating costs were low because our customer service was Legendary and because our people have the hearts of lions the strength of elephants and the determination of water buffals We did indeed survive and That is where I'll leave it for the full story. You can read both books. ([Time 0:40:19](https://share.snipd.com/snip/71ee9848-8376-4b9a-83f3-449108fb4d69))
    - **Note:** Love competition go to sleep on a win wake up on a loss he always wanted to be fighting for market share and have a wartime mentality around competition. He framed the United attack as a war us versus them that their lives were on the line in this fight. Needed to attack the situation with vigor and believed he could beat United with 1/7th the resources and a ton of grit. Success is never final. It must be earned over and over again. Uses memorable language. Herb is naturally very curious when he went to Richmond Virginia he bought a 300 page history book about the history of Richmond. The illiterate of the future will be those who can’t learn. Spend more time with your people than other ceos. Stay conservative in operation only the strong survive.
