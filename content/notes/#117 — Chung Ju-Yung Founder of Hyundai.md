  Speaker 1
  Why does one start a business? The usual answer is to provide for one's family and to contribute to the national economy. But we forget just how much of a struggle it is to keep a business afloat. Has my father said, you need to pour all your blood, sweat and tears into trying to make it succeed. From when he was first starting his first auto repair shop in a small, makeshift garage to when he was building the dry docks for what would become the world's largest ship building company, It was a daily struggle aist impending disaster, trying to keep things going when so many things could and did go wrong. In 19 73, when he was driving himself through the shipyard construction site in the early morning in a raging storm, his jeep fell off the breakwater into the sea. As the water started to pour into the jeep and he was trying desperately to kick the door open, he remembers thinking to himself, if i don't make it, people will say that i disappeared Because i could not handle the mountain of debt that i was under. His was a lifetime spent making possible seem the seemingly impossible. When some one said that a proposed project would be impossible, his famous response was, did you try? My father was a self taught man. ([Time 0:06:01](https://share.snipd.com/snip/edc632d8-dc04-457b-94da-239127b680dd))
    - **Note:** He had a ruthless work ethic worked maybe harder than anyone in history. 3 years of formal schooling and grit. Education stoped at 6th grade. Life is just a sequence of days. Wonderfully positive disposition and crazy work ethic. Could see the light in the most dire circumstances. Learned constantly from books. Him building Hyundai was Murphy’s law and Hyundai was also an industrials company not just cars. With strong conviction any effort anything can be achieved we all have equal capital in time and can do anything as a result. Time is evenly distributed capital. Never took a day off always working. He believed he had unlimited potential and growth mindset he ran away from home 3 times to realize his potential. They were so poor they had to shit only in a bucket at home so they’d have enough fertilizer they couldn’t poop anywhere else and they ate tree bark. He becomes the richest man in Korea. He worked every hour in the day.

They would provide meals, they provide housing and then a a little bit of money. In no time, i sought i was sought out by other people to do various odd jobs. As stories of my work at the spread, for the first time, i was able save a little bit of money at every opportunity. I scoured the city for a better job. One lucky day, a rice shop hired me as a delivery boy. It was a stable job with great benefits. And when he's talking about there tho great benefits, he gets one free bag of rice a month. I'm later in life, he would say, thi that was the first time i his entire life he felt rich. I felt optimistic about my future. Every day was full of joy and excitement. Yet my heart ached at the thought of my father toiling alone on the farm. Three years passed until i finally wrote him a letter. By then, my ann salary had increased to 20 bags of rice.

Always grinding and never slacked first one in and did things that made sure he wasn’t lazy he would sweep the house early. His only qualification for the job was riding a bike which he lied and taught himself. Always working would take on extra responsibility give it your all until the end until nothing more can be done. One day the owner offered to sell him the shop after only 4 years and strives to make it the best rice shop ever. Soon the sino Japanese war starts and then the government takes all the rice shops. He took out a loan to start an auto repair shop it burns down he had to beg for another loan and start from scratch.

  Speaker 1
  And he it's about what you can learn from bed books. So i want to take a short tangicaus. I lovea a this story, and then we'll get into hondi. Whenever i tell people that it was bed books that taught me nothing is impossible if one puts in one's best effort, they think i'm exaggerating, but this is the truth. So im to make ends meet, he's taking any jobs you can imagin taking any job he can possibly get, and it's all manual labor. He's back to where he started. Ju as the bunk house where i slept as a laborer was teeming with so many bu bed bugs that it was almost impossible to fall asleep. Some of the other workers tried to think of ways to avoid the bed bugs. But even when they slept on top of dining tables, they were still bittan bitten, as the parasites could climb up the legs of the tables. We put our heads together and came up with an idea of placing a steel pot filled with water under each of the four legs of the table. It worked temporarily. Unfortunately, un uninterrupted sleep lasted only two days. Then things went back to normal, the way they had been before the bed bugs were biting us again. We wondered, how could this be possible, considering that the bed bugs would fall into the pot of water if they attempted to climb up any of the lakes. One night we decided to stay up to see how on earth they survived the water and managed to bite us. We were completely dumbstruck by what we saw. The lights were turned on. The bed bugs were climbing the walls and dropping from the ceiling on to our bodies. To this day, i cannot forget the shiver down my spine that i felt back then. This made me stop in my tracks and think. Even bed bugs think long and hard and use every bit of energy they have to achieve their goal, and ultimately they succeed. I'm no bedbug. I'm a man. These bed bugs can surely teach a man a few lessons. If these bedbugs can do it, why can't we men do it? ([Time 0:32:21](https://share.snipd.com/snip/72066052-d1ae-45f6-b0c1-9244a2203553))
    - **Note:** He learned how he’s bugs were literally doing anything including scaling the walls to bite him. Be like a bed bug they did everything they need. He believes in his own agency. He has never built a construction company but saw there was value in it so he learned. His construction business is successful and gets taken over during the Korean War. He works for the us army as part of the war. He dies anything to be successful. He sets crazy high standards. He’s one of the most optimistic person in the world. They branched out until other countries which he took as a learning opportunity. Sees himself as a builder above all. He tried to secure a Jv with ford having no experience in the space jist believed they could do it. Only has one speed go. He built a car for the us not Korea which has bad roads then his factory gets floaded. Always looked for the positives.

  Speaker 1
  And so in the middle of all this, he starts having major promises fort and he realizes that this is not, they had a 50 50 joint venture, but it's nots its equal in name only. And this happens a lot as he goes abroad. He says essentially like, list n these rich, multi national corporations. They take advantage of developed countries constantly. And he's saying, ford's doing this to him. Eventually he's going to run to similar situations whenhewhe he tries to build a the largest ship building company. So says ford was planning on using hondi as a sub contractor. The real intent was to maintain our prior technical agreement and sell their products without taking risks, which which ould effectuively turn us into a sub contractor that made parts For ford with cheap labor. There was no way i was going to let that happen. Who would allow themselves to be duped like that? I couldn't allow ford to do this. Ah. So now he tells his partner, i think this is his brother, actually. Any he says, listen, um, i need you. I want you to immediately dro up a plan to build cars with a hundred % corean made parts. Right at this time, they're still trying to fulfil the change that president park wants to make. Eventually they realize, ha, we can't do this. They have to the engine from japan. They get the design work from italy. Ah. But the important part here is what they realize. And essentially, what they realize you need to maintain control. Ok? So heo his his, i think it's his brothers, he one that's doing this. ([Time 0:50:43](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f9aa7a3f-ab12-4c2a-8b92-a055ff266cdc))
    - **Note:** His jv with ford is ultimately successful because they lose control. He focused going forward as maintaining control going forward. They just made bad decisions in design in the past. They learn from this and make an unsourced car themselves that everyone loved. He started small then scaled with ideas. He comes up with the idea to build a shipyard and decides to make it the biggest one in the world. Constant improvement. He got the government support for an idea but got turned down for financing by many. He gave up but the president of South Korea gave him a taste of his own medicine to keep pushing and never stop. He then keeped pushing hold yourself to high standards and sometimes you need a push from others. When people say he can’t do it he works harder. Grit more important than intelligence. Very smart but works hard with giant ego 100/100 determination
