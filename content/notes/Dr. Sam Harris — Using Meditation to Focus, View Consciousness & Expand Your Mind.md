  And so much of our suffering in the presence of pain is the result of resisting it, worrying about it. I think it's just all of the everything we're doing with our minds, but just just feeling it. Right. So when you just feel it, again, it breaks apart into this ever change, ever shifting collection of different sensations. And it's not one thing and it never stays the same. And it's, and so there's two things happen there. One is there can be tremendous, tremendous amount of relief that happens there, where you can achieve a level of equanimity, even in the presence of really unpleasant, you know, physical sensation. And this is true of mental sensation as well. This is true of emotions, you know, the classically negative emotions like anger or depression or fear. The moment you become willing to just feel them in all of their, you know, punctate and changeable qualities, they cease to be what they were a moment ago. They're just there. And they, when you're talking about emotional states, they cease to map back on to you and your self-concept as meaningful in the same way. So that suddenly, you know, the anxiety you feel, let's say before going out on stage to give a talk, you know, a moment ago, it was, it had psychological meaning. It felt like, you know, okay, I'm anxious. How do I get rid of this? You know, why am I this sort of person? You know, should I have taken a beta blocker? You know, this is the conversation you're having with yourself. The moment you just become willing to feel it as the pure energy of, you know, the physiology of, you know, cortisol release, it ceases to have any meaning. It just ceases to be a problem in that moment because it's no more, it's no more maps on to the kind of person you are than a feeling of indigestion or pain in your knee maps on to the kind of person you are. It's just, it's just sensation. ([Time 1:32:26](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c6e58f7a-ec41-4d47-9567-33b3300fe804))
    - **Note:** Anxiety is just about slowing down and feeling how you feel without judgement. Don’t let your mind run off to crazy places just accept the situation and view it objectively. You defang the situation by removing it from your identity and just seeing it as a physical reaction.
