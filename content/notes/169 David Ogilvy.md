  They did not think he was ready. So they thought he was a number two. They did not think he was capable of running the company. So he has to find a president to work that has experience before they let him open. And then very soon after they realized, okay, agency or agency, Ogilvy forces a confrontation. That guy winds up getting kicked out and Ogilvy runs it. But this is a little bit about the beginning. It was David against Goliath, a startup British outpost against dozens of majors and agencies with established pedigrees. A handful of tiny overseas accounts with unfamiliar names. They have almost no business. Minimal funding, an unproven president and a brash research director with lots of theories but no practical experience in advertising. This was not exactly a sure bet. Ogilvy understood it would be a tough struggle to carve out a niche in the United States, but he put up a brave front and outlined his goals in a bold memo. This is what he said. This is what he wrote. This is a new agency struggling for its life. For some time, we shall all be overworked and underpaid. Our main object is to provide a pleasant living for the people who work with us. Next comes profit. In hiring, the emphasis will be on youth. We are looking for young Turks. I have no use for toadies or hacks. I seek gentlemen with brains. We've seen that ([Time 0:46:49](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9b7d671b-4495-4810-aa53-74af52efce81))
    - **Note:** Ogilvy started his own agency with little experience and no one would’ve likely hired him he was starting the American office of a brittish firm and proved to be formidable he built it from the ground up staring at 0 and looking fir gentleman with brains. He set incredibly high standards from day 1 and rarely praised so to not devalue his word. Extremely persistent and very direct and brief. He never gave up on an idea. He used aphorisms to condense his points. No statues of commitees pay peanuts get monkeys. Vivid metaphors. He hated laziness everything not amazing is bad. He made ads 20x as good as his competitors. He was incredibly successful there was so much variance in success that companies flocked toward success. His ads were so successful his customers had to add more capacity. Tail upsides. In 5 years he became great but it really was the summation of his life and 5 years of application. He was a loving legend. He had main character energy. He wrote 100 pieces of copy for rolles Royce he just did so much there was bound to be a good ad in there. He pulled the eventual ad from an 20 year old manual on page 100 something that said at 70 mph the loudest thing was the clock. That’s dedication and research don’t fool yourself about what success demands. He became mentally crushed and afraid of failure for many years he had to work harder as a result but mentally this somewhat destroyed him and set him backwards.

  Him to do unwise things later on, like sell all of his stock when he shouldn't know. Released with lingering insecurities about himself and the prospects for his agency, Ogilvy started two years of psychoanalysis. Every day for years, I thought this agency was going to fail. I was scared sick. I remember saying one day, if this is success, God delivered me from failure. The cure was not found on a psychiatrist's couch, but in work. Ogilvy redoubled his efforts, working deep into the night in virtually full time and weekends, creating campaigns, hunting new business. He seldom entertained clients, telling them that he worked his guts out, trying to produce good advertising, and couldn't do that and take them to the theater. So let's go back to him building. The term company culture didn't really exist at this time, but that's essentially what he's doing. So this is some more lessons. There have a lot of highlights actually, because I found it interesting. They're probably the most actionable parts of this book. Entire stories with only a few words is the noise left myself. They exhorted his staff in memos. Raise your sights. Compete with the immortals. Blaze new trails. Soak yourself in research. Never stop selling. Never content with just writing ads. Ogilvy's larger goal was to create an enduring institution. That sounds a ([Time 0:59:16](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d3432952-4840-454f-91a1-b6c4e4478556))
    - **Note:** He was very intentional about company culture and wanted to create an enduring institution. The culture was very intentionally and he surrounded himself with people who had high standards. He was incredibly focused by 1 thing advertising and making money. He knew his worth and turned down clients. His adventures of an advertising man is the best book on advertising ever. He worked 9-12 3 wives didn’t have much of a life and regretted this later. Buffet made more money buying his company than he did. He thought he needed to acquire competitors but he should’ve further invested in the best aka himself. They created an intentional culture with a mission and strong culture. Tough but fun agency. He looked at all the ads for the last 20 years then started doing market research then wrote 20 headlines to throw away then started writing no one was doing this he had no competition. He was an amazing writer but he thought he was a better editor than writer. He kept it very short and readable. His brilliance was his simplicity. Ogilvy lost control and this destroyed him. He messed up by losing control and agency. Steal from the best. His philosophy was we sell or else and let his good ideas compound.
