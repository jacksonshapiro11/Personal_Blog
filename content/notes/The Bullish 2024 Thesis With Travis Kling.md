  Speaker 1
  And that certainly flows into this kind of financial nihilism component and, you know, Ponzi schemes, you know, they just mean, they mean something different in different parts of The world than they mean in America. And there's a different acceptance level and all this kind of things. And all of that is relevant to this conversation. In America, you know, it is just this view that that the American dream is just not within reach up, you know, upward mobility. American dream, you know, I was born lower class and I'm going to die, you know, middle class and my kids are going to die upper middle class like that kind of thing. Like that's just, you know, the view is that that is just not really available to nearly as many people as it was a generation or two generations. And there are a pile of statistics to point you to that being true. And, you know, one just headline one is right, the relationship between median home prices and medium weight, median income. And that relationship being so incredibly out of whack, but there's a bunch of other statistics you could point to as well too. And I backed that up with with the, you know, the popularity of online gambling is skyrocketing, skyrocketing. And that's a big component of this as well too. And people are just trying to figure out ways to get a lot more money than they have right now. You know, I think social media, I think social media also plays a component to this as well too because people, you know, wealth is haunted on social media to a degree that you just rewind 10 years ago. And it was just a lot harder to see that many people flexing. You just didn't have the availability of just getting hit over the head with people flexing constantly. And, you know, in painting this picture of their life, which, you know, may or may not be an accurate characterization of their life, but, you know, I mean, all of this plays in into this Situation and, and, dude, shit coining is like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like crypto traders, DJs, they call it Valhalla for a reason. Like it's like, it's literally, that's the terminology that is used. And you're just trying to hope I can just catch this token. If I can just catch this token. Everybody's got the story of their buddy that, you know, put 25 K and she but he knew and cast out 9 million or whatever. It's like everybody now has a story like that. And I just think that that feeling is stronger now. Then it has been in prior cycles and the conviction that those opportunities will be there in the next 12 to 18 months that conviction is higher now that it ever has been in the six, seven Years that I've been doing this full time. There is a token on a liquid exchange that is going to do a 2000% up in next 12 months. It's out there. You can buy it right now. I don't know what it is, but you get my point, right? So what does that tell? I mean, is there something to be learned from that? Even just hearing you describe that. I would agree with you. And I feel it myself. I feel it myself. Like, yeah, these ults are probably going to weigh out perform Bitcoin and even I started asking myself, like, should I be more, you know, should I be adjusting how I'm thinking? But what does that tell you about the actual, you know, opportunity set if everyone already has that expectation or the price is already baked in more than they were? Or what, you know, is it different this time because we all believe it? Like, what do you think about that? We could do a separate two hour podcast of trying to dissect capital flows and just how tokens stay afloat, how drawdowns happen, you know, how a token pulls down 95% in a bear and then Hits an all time high and new all time highs and next bear and like trying to estimate like how much selling occurred to drive the price down 95% relative to like how much actual money came In to push it back up.
