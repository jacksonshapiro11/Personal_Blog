    - **Note:** Establish artificial time constraints smile at the other person and have strong non verbal communication speak clearly and slowly. Ask for sympathy and assistance while mitigating your ego. Listen and validate peoples opinions with thoughtful engaged responses that let them get to your point through their understanding. Listen and ask open ended who when and why questions don't forumlate answers. Make it seem like you are part of the conversation and they're not ranting. Give fifts without an agenda. Lower expectations for the situation
- **4. Sympathy or Assistance Theme**
  If you’re like most people, you’ve felt a bit of regret for turning down someone seeking help.
  > Think for a moment about the times in your life when you have either sought assistance or been asked to provide it. When the request is simple, of limited duration, and non-threatening, we are more inclined to accommodate the request. As human beings, we are biologically conditioned to accommodate requests for assistance. The compulsion is based upon the fact that our ancient ancestors knew that if they did not provide assistance when asked, the assistance would not be granted to them if requested at a later date.

    - **Note:** We struggle to ask for help but we are natural wired to cooperate and help others. Value of reciprocity and cooperation.
- **5. Ego Suspension**
  This may be the most rewarding and most difficult of all of Robin’s techniques.
  > Suspending your ego is nothing more complex than putting other individuals’ wants, needs, and perceptions of reality ahead of your own. Most times, when two individuals engage in a conversation, each patiently waits for the other person to be done with whatever story he or she is telling. Then, the other person tells his or her own story, usually on a related topic and often times in an attempt to have a better and more interesting story. Individuals practicing good ego suspension would continue to encourage the other individual to talk about his or her story, neglecting their own need to share what they think is a great story.

    - **Note:** Ego suppression. Fully surrender to the conversation and listen fully. Do not mitigate the other persons feelings but give them more space to allow them to come out and then also pull them out.
- **. Validate Others**
  There are many types of validation. Robin identifies three of them.
  1. **Listening.** This is the simplest and one of the most effective. Just listen to someone can produce amazing results. Where we run into problems is keeping our own thoughts, ideas, and stories out of the conversation. “True validation coupled with ego suspension means that you have no story to offer, that you are there simply to hear theirs.” And there is another benefit. When the focus is on the other person and we’re not anxious to tell our own story, we also tend to remember the details. We’re mindful.
  2. **Thoughtfulness** “.. few people naturally use this to its fullest potential, and, most of the time, we don’t realize when it is being used; all we know is we really like the person who gives it.” Demonstrating thoughtfulness in words and actions with everyone in our lives is a simple and effective way to improve our relationships.
  3. **Validate Thoughts and Opinions.** This technique is quite difficult because of “our innate need to correct others and the difficulty we have suppressing our own egos.” But if you remember that we like people who are like us, you’ll immediately grasp the power of validating thoughts and opinions of others.
  The best way to get someone to do what you want them to do is to have them come up with the idea. And the best way to have them come up with your idea is, no surprise, to honestly [understand the other person’s point of view](https://fs.blog/2013/04/the-work-required-to-have-an-opinion/) and then build upon that base with your ideas.

- **7. Ask … How? When? Why?**
  It’s hard to answer these questions with a simple yes or no.
  > Once the individual being targeted in the conversation supplies more words and thoughts, a great conversationalist will utilize the content given and continue to ask open ended questions about the same content. The entire time, the individual being targeted is the one supplying the content of the conversation.
  This means suppressing your ego and listening to what people are saying. You’re not thinking about what you’re going to say next. You’re not thinking about how the person is wrong. If you’re really listening then asking open ended questions based on the content of what they are saying should be pretty easy.

    - **Note:** Supress ego and just listen don't prep answers or think youre smart
- **8. Connect with Quid Pro Quo**
  In the context of a conversation, this means giving up a little information about yourself in order to further the conversation and get a little from others.
  > In my experiences, there are really only two types of situations where I have utilized quid pro quo. The first and more common of the instances is when you attempt to converse with someone who is either very introverted, guarded, or both. The second instance is when the person you are conversing with suddenly becomes very aware about how much they have been speaking, and they suddenly feel awkward. In both instances, giving a little information about you will help alleviate some of the issues. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkjejt57mv9sn8cdfj1jqfxy))

    - **Note:** Sometimes in a conversation you need to play a little tennis and give information about yourself so it seems less one sided. Reciprocity.
- **9. Gift Giving**
  This is conversational reciprocation in action.
  > Great rapport builders and conversationalists use this desire proactively during every conversation. This technique, coupled with ego suspension, are the cornerstones for building great relationships. This is also the easiest technique to utilize, because gifts come in many forms, from non-material compliments, to tangible material gifts. Gift giving, or reciprocal altruism, is hardwired in our genetics. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkjej8mpdrmbag1t17drysyr))

- **10. Manage Expectations**
  > Regardless of the situation, whether it is an altruistic intention or not, there is an agenda. The individuals in life that are able to either mask their agenda or shift the agenda to something altruistic will have great success at building rapport.
  The surest way to avoid disappointment is to lower expectations. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkjej4jts51y2ycdfyex963e))
