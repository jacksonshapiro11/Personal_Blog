### Highlights

- *Notice how I didn’t study endless tutorials to learn those skills. I set a goal of working for myself, started a project, and practiced those skills while educating myself along the way.*
  All of those “failures” were the reason I can do what I do today.
  There are 2 reasons why this story matters.
  1) Failure Stacking Makes You Irreplaceable
  Most people know what “skill stacking” is.
  It’s like a diversified stock portfolio.
  Rather than investing all of your money in one stock – like a specialist – that sets you up for catastrophe, you invest in various stocks to increase your chances at success.
  Even if one stock drops, a few others may go up and you will still be at a profit.
  If you were going to be in the NBA or have a platinum album, you would know by now.
  Being the best at one specific thing is statistically near impossible.
  Now, being top 25% in the few areas you find interesting… that’s pretty easy.
  To make this more digestible, let’s reframe “skill stacking” as “failure stacking.”
  Acquiring a skill puts you in the mindset that you just need to study and learn all day.
  Acquiring a failure assumes that you are actively working toward a goal and gaining actual experience.
  • **Identify a goal in your life** – like quitting your job, finding a partner, or getting fit.
  • **Start with what you know** – you can only know what to learn when you hit a roadblock, so hit one fast.
  • **Pursue your curiosity** – let your experience guide you into new paths to experiment with.
  All of these will overlap eventually.
  Starting in fitness can introduce you to diet models to try, training programs to test, and lifestyle changes to implement.
  Once you get to the top 25%, which isn’t much in fitness, you can explore new routes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hy9s18pe9p02ezxascg3qtg9))
