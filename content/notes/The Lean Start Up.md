### Highlights

- To create an innovative organization you need to give people equity in side ventures to align their incentives and disrupt yourself. Disrupting yourself is scary but you need to embrace it and use an agile disruption. You need to support the innovation from the org even if it’s scary. Use actionable not vanity metrics small batch process with short cycle times clear growth hypothesis strong experimental design and strong team ownership so you can learn as much as possible. Innovation sandbox building Any team can create a split test experiment but one team must see it through end to end and experiments can only keep a going for a certain amount of time and no experiment can effect more than a specified customer base every experiment just be evaluated by 5-10 metrics every team inside this sandbox must use the same metrics and record metrics and progress. For learning use the same idea Build an ideal model based on customer ideas build an mvp then iterate. Product lifecycle R+D to strategy then optimized and disrupted The lean start up isn’t about steps but the critical approach being cultivated. Create good explanations then test them. The goal of a start up isn’t hours worked but product success. Switching to validated learning is hard but it’s not about steps but overall success. Building systems is harder but long term better Management is human systems engineering The issues are we’re building the wrong things. Misallocation of time in the wrong thing. Create a better system through good theory. Use scientific ideas.
- Start ups need to adapt and create training programs for young people with good mentors and mentees. Good organizations must continue to adapt. Start ups need to balance speed going fast in the wrong direction is bad you can’t sacrifice quality for time. Go fast without short cuts balance learning and quality. Use the 5 whys to get from the proximate to root cause. Make investments relative to the size of the issue and get down to fixing the system. For 5 whys start small and scale your ability to do it. Then appoint a point person for every investigation. Everyone who’s important needs to be there at the 5 why’s meeting. They should only be for new not endemic problems at the beginning of each session explain what the 5 whys process is for. For building products you need to be while you can’t start with the idea of what you want to build then release after 9 months you need to work with customers to iterate. When you want to make product changes to cycle times you first must make system changes you can’t push deadlines up and expect it to work with the same system. Create more decentralized experiments.

    - **Note:** Create training programs and get to the root cause of issues through the 5 whys. Root cause analysis. Tustin iterate quickly through decentralized experiments. While getting customer feedback. Balance speed, and execution have good communication.
- Engine of growth is mechanism to drive sustainable growth not one off bumps. Sustainable growth means new customers come from past customers. 1. Growth comes from word of mouth 2 as a side effect as product usage like luxury clothes or PayPal. 3. Funded advertising paid for out of revenue cac must be lower than Ltv 4. Through repeat purchase or use like groceries vs wedding which is one time growth. Need to optimize between Find new customers service existing customer improve quality drive down costs. Engines of growth are a few key metrics to focus on that drive key growth to create validated learning. Database tech creates a platform hard to get network effects but strong barriers to entry. Vendor lock in high retention. Sticky growth is focused on adds vs churns are you too slow on adds or too high on churn. Viral growth where the message is passed on like a virus. Powered by the viral loop which measures new customers that joins per customer that signed up how many customers sign up other customers if 1 in 10 then the number is .1 growth bigger than 1 is exponential growth. This means you can’t really charge people. Paid engine of growth cac to Ltv. Understand your engine of growth. Get your Product market fit. Engine of growth can give you a sense if you’re on the verge of product market fit or nod. Focus on your rate of growth. Tune your engine develop new engines.

    - **Note:** There are many different engines of growth and you need to find and tune yours to make your business run optimally. What fits your product and barriers to entry. What is your engine LTV/CaC
- Batch processing can be more efficient because you get to iterate more. Lean start up practices continuous deployment making multiple changes a day one at a time instead of many all at once in monthly releases. Reduce batch size allows you to learn and iterate faster. Increasing learning rate is the name of the start up. Large batches can actually be less efficient than small batches due to less flex. Lean start ups benefit from having less work in progress inventory more things in front of customers. Figure out what we want to learn then pull the product out of that insight. High functioning organizations learn faster.

    - **Note:** increase the learning rate and iterate faster by releasing more products and getting more feedback at a higher rate. Quicker stronger feedback looks purposeful learning and testing of ideas. Critical approach to company building
      Increase learning rate by iterating faster.
- Use split testing to keep measuring assumptions. Know when to pivot don’t live in the land of the living dead see what’s working pivot and grow. Know what metrics to look at and when to pivot. Viral growth and optimization of key metrics. Understand your runway and how many pivots you have to achieve more validated learning. Pivot sooner understand the game on the field. Fail fast and fail often. Pivots repurpose what has been built and learned to find an optimal direction. Customer segment pivot is when you stop making an mvp for early adopters and create a product for the masses who have different requirements. They were chasing growth when they needed to shift their customer archetype. Zoom in pivot when you make one feature the entire project. Zoom out pivot when you expand the product to include more features. Customer segment pivot right problem wrong customer. Customer need pivot you understand your customer well and you move into a related section pivot like selling sandwiches as part of the business to going into a sandwich shop. Platform pivot turn into a platform. Business architecture pivot go from high margin to low volume to low margin high volume. Value capture or revenue pivot. Engine of growth pivot vital sticky and paid growth. Channel pivot of where you sell going from internet to retail ect. Technology pivot creating the same solution with different tech like going from in paper to online taxes with turbo tax. Pivot is a new strategic hypothesis and are constant in business. Pivot = Structured change to test hypothesis about product business model engine of growth
- Innovation accounting first starts with an mvp to get real data then tune and optimize the mvp then you reach a decision point toward and ideal. Then you need to pivot or go forward but make sure you write form your key assumptions and make sure that’s what you track. Create learning milestones. Don’t track product quality increases but value to customer increases and be clear what value you want to provide. Do a customer cohort analysis. You need to know what to test and look for to make progress. Don’t live in ignorance of the situation. Pivots show step change metrics then optimize and keep growing. See what’s working and what’s not brainstorm and run experiments and keep compounding this throwing out what doesn’t work and improving what does. The team not having success doesn’t mean it’s not working hard it could be in the wrong area altogether. Vanity metrics tell you if you’re growing but setting these incremental metrics help you test if your improvements are driving value or if they’re doing nothing but the headline metrics are so strong that your lack of continuous improvement is falling through the cracks and ultimately your future growth and progress will be hampered by neglecting this fact so get strong feedback loops with incremental testing. A-B testing for product development so you can see if new features increase engagement. Products can be in backlog being built done and then validated. Need clear hypothesis and tested. Applying the critical approach to start up feature building. Metrics need to be actionable accessible and auditable. Start ups are 1% inspiration 99% perspiration.

    - **Note:** Write down and test key assumptions create milestones. Track value to the customer. Don't be ignorant pivot. Run experiments. Throw out what doesn't work sometimes your in the wrong areas. Figure out if youre driving value. AB test things. Test hypothesis most of this is grit
- Build measure learn. Projects first start ups are experiments and the learning is the output of those experiments and that information reshapes the next version of ideas. Fine tune your building and growth assumptions. Strategy is there to test core business assumptions. What leap of faith are you taking in your venture that is hidden deep in your assumptions. The best founders understand what’s working what key assumptions they make and pivot what doesn’t work. Seeing from the front and knowing what your customers want. Understand your customer prototypes. Customer archetype is a hypothesis not a fact. Who is your customers? Understand that. Test using a minimum viable product. MVP is what you need to build to test your key assumptions. Concierge mvp you do things that don’t scale by focusing on only a few customers and giving them full attention then you do this until it gets a bit to big and hammer out the kinks. This white glove service doesn’t scale but is a helpful ground floor first option to learn about the customer. This is a learning activity to test leap of faith assumptions. Customers don’t care how much time you spent on the product they just care about it’s utility to them. Use innovation accounting to see if you’re learning.

    - **Note:** Build measure learn products are experiments where you are testing key assumptions with your strategy. What leap of faiths are you taking how are you testing and tuning that to future versions. Keep what works throw out what doesn't/ pivot
      Customer arechtype is flexible and you should test many through mvps. People dont care about the product just it's utility to them. So things that dont scale
- When you talk to customers you get direct feedback from things they said that you didn’t know they wanted and sometimes they didn’t even know they wanted. They talked to customers and realized their mental models were not what customers actually experienced or wanted and their killer feature was useless to these users. All their fundamental assumptions were wrong. It was painful but they had to pivot their entire strategy or die. Learn to see value and eliminate waste. Learning is the unit of progress for start ups don’t build products you don’t need to but build what you have to to get the feedback you need. AB testing and validated learning. Figure out what’s actually happening. Productivity is systematically figuring out what you need to build. Having 0 revenue is better than having a little bit. Get data and strong feedback loops. Don’t use theatrics and pr but validated learning to iterate and develop the product. Break down the business plan into component parts and run experiments on each. Think big start small and scale. Run experiments and learn as you scale. Get real customer data and learn their problems. Figure out black swans too. Don’t guess and plan. Test key hypothesis small and iterate. If it’s failing investigate and pivot. Success is learning how to solve a customers problem

    - **Note:** Talk to customers to test your insights and assumptions and align the mental models you have with theirs and if your killer features dont work pivot
      Learning is the unit of progress in a start up build the MVP to test your assumptions. Then iterate and figure out what you need to build next.
      Use validated learning by breaking dont the business into parts then running experiments on each assumption get the data make the plans test key hypothesis and pivot when needed. Success is learning how to solve customers problems
- Start ups have a vision and the product is the end goal of that vision the problem your solving market customers. Start ups are all about build and iterate. Not getting dogmatic but being flexible in execution. Steer the boat every day. Start ups are meant to fail iterate and improve. Start ups can be a black box to traditional management how can we evolve that thinking. Start ups are more than just execution they’re more complex steps that can lead to failure or success so you can’t just look at extrapolation in their process. Start ups are decentralized bottom up but they can still be managed. Start up and organization designed to create new products and services under deep uncertainty Middle management spends time analyzing so crushes true innovation. Create systems to run experiments in companies. Learning is the biggest cop out for failure of execution we must learn the truth about our strategy not use failure as a learning experience

    - **Note:** Don't chalk failure up to learning thats a false equivalency. Start ups are meant to build iterate and learn ask the right questions to get the right answers. Steer the boat every day fail iterate and improve. They're more than execution but a complex process that is developed through organizational learning that is bottoms up organic and decentralized. Build robust decentralized anti fragile learning machines.
- Start ups as not a grand plan but constant iteration and innovation cycle. Get something in the hands of customers get feedback ship quickly take more feedback incorporate some ignore others run tests. Start ups are everywhere hit companies and small. Start ups are about management. Use validated learning. Build measure learn make something see how customers react and adjust accelerate the learning loop. Innovation accounting hold yourself accountable for the small boring parts of start ups. Start ups meed management and guidance in the chaos.
