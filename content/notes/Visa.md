### Highlights

- Episode AI notes
  1. In the post-depression era, as the network of collaborating retailers grew, competition intensified and sustaining the network became challenging. Shared organizations or third-party networks like Diners Club and American Express were created to solve this problem.
  2. Bank of America streamlined and simplified their lending programs to achieve operational savings and increase loan volume, which is a profitable aspect of their business. This innovation also led to credit cards offering the option to pay in full or take out a loan.
  3. The Bank of America card design was inspired by a beautiful hillside in California and became valuable for businesses as it increased sales and customer excitement. The design facilitated the creation of a two-sided network with a common signal of acceptance.
  4. Ownership of the National Bank of America card, Inc. is determined by the volume contributed to the network, ensuring network value and preventing selling shares. Participants receive profits proportionate to their contribution.
  5. Burger King introduced credit cards in 1993, initially viewed as sad and cumbersome. However, it aimed to encourage card usage even if there were potential financial losses. Today, cash is seen as slower and less convenient compared to card payments.
  6. Visa spent $110 million to become the exclusive payment provider at the Olympics and focused on training people to use their payment card. This showcases Visa's dominance in the payment industry. ([Time 0:00:00](https://share.snipd.com/episode-takeaways/15d0fb1b-af11-4421-a294-7d0ad36a6049))
- The Challenges of Scaling Retailer Networks
  Key takeaways:
  - This concept emerged in the US during the post-depression era of the 1930s and 1940s.
  - As the collaborative network of retailers grows, competition within the network increases.
  - Once the network reaches a certain scale, maintaining its effectiveness becomes challenging.
  - Individual merchants lack the resources to manage a large network.
  - Creating a shared organization or relying on a third-party network can solve this problem.
  - Diners Club and American Express were examples of independent third-party networks.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So this comes to be kind of post depression in the 1930s, 1940s in the US. And this really is starting to sound a lot like visa, except as you point out, then there is a problem here as the size of any given network of retailers that are collaborating on this grows. So does the intensity of competition within that network. So once you get to a certain scale, nobody's really incentivized to keep making this work. A, because now you're enabling people to shop all your competitors, but also B, once you get past, I don't know, a couple hundred, a thousand participants here, like our individual Merchants equipped to manage a network like this. No, they don't have the resources to do this. Right.
  Speaker 2
  So you have to spin up some kind of like shared organization that all the merchants are pulling their capital into in order to run the network on behalf of all of the merchants. It gets messy.
  Speaker 1
  Or there could be an independent third party for profit network that does this. And this is when Diners Club and American Express arrive on the scene. ([Time 0:16:20](https://share.snipd.com/snip/908c3272-833e-4477-bdb9-fb8f35929d50))
    - **Note:** Spending money was really hard and charge cards had become prominent but struggled at scale you didn’t want 10 charge cards for 10 businesses. So there needed to be an independent arbiter of transactions to move value around Bank of America dropped these general charge cards in 1958 called the Fresno drop this made everyone’s life easier and better as spending was really tough to do. Bank of America centralizing and making operational issues lower was massive value add moving money was really tough. The first real charge card started at my restaurants great place to start a network effect because people were really rich and the network didn’t really compete because no one expects exclusivity at a restaurant. Important to know where to start for a network effect. This was so valuable businesses were happy to pay fees because they were growing their pie.
- B of A's motivations and opportunities in credit card lending
  Key takeaways:
  - B of A's motivation for streamlining and simplifying their lending programs is to achieve huge operational savings.
  - B of A sees the opportunity to increase loan volume and make money through more effective loan flow.
  - B of A's previous business model of lending to consumers informed the development of credit cards.
  - Bank American introduced the innovation of allowing customers to roll credit card balances into loans.
  - Bank American sees loans as a profitable extension of their services.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  But hopefully as we painted the picture, their motivation and diners club and Amex and even the merchants and retailers motivations are very different. B of A wants two things out of this. One, like we were saying earlier, they want to streamline and simplify all their wildly diverse lending programs. This is going to be huge operational savings for the bank if they can pull this off. Two, though, the bigger opportunity for B of A is what can this do for our banking business itself? Because remember how to banks make money. They make money on loans. And this is going to enable so much more effective loan volume to flow through our system that we can make money on.
  Speaker 2
  So this is where B of A, informed by their previous business model of lending to consumers, really paves the path of what credit cards would become today. Often in the past, before the bank American, what would happen is you'd have this charge card, not a credit card and the bill would arrive at the end of the month. And then you would pay it. The innovation baked into the bank American is they say, well, after the 30 days, you can get your statement, you can pay it in full or you can roll it into a loan. And we love loans. We would be happy to extend loans to our customers. ([Time 0:27:20](https://share.snipd.com/snip/29c2f2dd-f964-427b-84bd-97e0bb3c4e24))
    - **Note:** Bofa was making loans for everything as small as washing machines. Charge cards settled every month but BofA was a bank who could make loans so instead of settling you could roll it into a loan and the credit card was born. It helped then streamline operations as well so it was easier for them from that point of view before any additional improvements charge card + consumer lending from a read bank. Credit card was born. Bundled convience and credit. The drop was bad because they assumed loss ratios of secured lending to unsecured lending which was very wrong and lost them a lot of money. They were willing to weather the losses because of their size and they got to 2mm in year one. Amex only had 700k they were pushing their advantage and willing to loss lead. Bofa keeps the success of this secret then starts licsening it out to other orgs across 50 states this becomes the visa network.
- The Origin Story and Value of Bank of America's Card Design
  Key takeaways:
  - There is an origin story to the Bank of America card design.
  - The design was inspired by a beautiful hillside in Sonoma, California.
  - The design became valuable for businesses to display and increase sales.
  - Creating a two-sided network with a common signal of acceptance was a simple yet effective strategy for success.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  There's this amazing origin story to this. It's super reminiscent to the Windows XP bliss wallpaper, you know, that is the most viewed photo in the world, you know, the hills and it's actually in Sonoma, California. Huh. So the story is the B of A team when they were first rolling out the program, the guy tasked with card design. He lived in Pleasanton, California in the East Bay of the San Francisco Bay area, where, you know, it's pleasant and one fine spring morning. He looks out his back door at the local hillside. The sky is this beautiful blue with white puffy clouds, very much like the Windows XP bliss background and the hill is covered with beautiful golden colored California poppies in bloom. He rushes back inside. He paints an abstracted version of his beautiful hillside. Voila, the three bands, blue, white, gold, Bank of America, card Visa.
  Speaker 2
  And this would go on to be incredibly valuable to plaster on your storefront and say, we accept Bank of America here and that just means your sales are going to go up friction to purchase Goods, goes down, customers are excited to spend with you because they're shiny, cool thing that they like spending money on works there. And it's good for your business to be able to accept it.
  Speaker 1
  It's so wild that today, you know, we would think, Oh, what's a moat? What's a competitive advantage? What's durable? You know, you need technology advantage. You know, even how we think of brand, all the companies we've covered on the show. It's so much more than this, but it was so simple back in the day. It was just, could you create a two sided network where there was a common signal of acceptance?
  Speaker 3
  Yep.
  Speaker 1
  So from be a Vase perspective, they're like, yeah, we did all the work. ([Time 0:51:44](https://share.snipd.com/snip/adb692c6-55e5-4ca0-a11a-c8333f57b5b7))
    - **Note:** They create an accepted 2 sided network and that unlocked a fuck ton of value. Value unlock was simple. The network was shit it worked well internally for bofa but once there were different banks in the transaction on either side there were paper recipes going back and forth it was a mess but it was so convenient for consumers people had to accept it. The network was so valuable but so bad the merchant banks and network members called a summit to air grevences out if they came visa. At the meeting Dee hock kinda got an ok to create the network maybe it was just to shut him up thinking nothing would come of it but he ran with it.
- National Bank of America Card, Inc.
  Key takeaways:
  - Ownership of the new organization, National Bank of America card, Inc., is based on irrevocable, non-transferable rights of participation.
  - Ownership is determined by the amount of volume contributed to the network.
  - The ownership representation is non-transferable and cannot be sold.
  - The network is designed for participants to break even on their contribution through profits received from transaction fees.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  One, ownership of this new organization that's going to be called National Bank of America card, Inc, the new owner of the bank America card program is going to be in the form of irrevocable, Non transferable rights of participation. So you're not going to own stock in this thing. There's no equity. The way that you have ownership and the percentage ownership that you have in the network is by participating in it and the amount of volume that you are contributing to the network.
  Speaker 3
  Oh, interesting.
  Speaker 1
  So this means a couple of things. One, it's sort of like a representation in ownership according to value contributed. Two, it's non transferable. So you can't sell it. Any individual bank, if they were to say, like, Oh, this is valuable now, I'm going to go sell it. And then I no longer have any incentive to participate in the network. If that starts happening, then it'll lead to a cascade for the exits and the network will lose value. So there's no way to do that.
  Speaker 2
  So it's basically designed for you to kind of break even on it. If you're putting in 17% of the transactions on the whole network and you're paying in fees on 17% of the transaction, well, good news for all of the leftover profits from running the
  Speaker 1
  Network, 17% of them go back to you. ([Time 1:16:13](https://share.snipd.com/snip/17b975ae-fe92-4cd8-a3d3-59bd30d819c0))
    - **Note:** Dee is self taught only had an associates degree but is always learning. Until someone says no they’re waiting to say yes. Until your company folds your going to suceed. The benefits of having this massive 2 sided network as so strong but you need an independent 3rd party and you need all banks to sign up to make it valuable no exclusions. Sitting in the middle of that is extremely valuable tax on the economy. Dee goes to the DOJ says this is obviously collusion but the value is greater and got an exemption. The ownership is based on network usage and governance is a completely democracy. Dee had great debate skills and he uses that to convince people to join you can’t connect the dots looking forward but that convincing was key to making visa successsful. He was asking for people to do things not fully in their interests. Eventually they launch and people are fighting for sign ups of the branded bank specific card. Visa is an open network of banks and so banks seeing this opportunity jump in as a growth opportunity leading to large network growth in the beginning. They’re benefiting from not being a bank but a network.
- Burger King introduces credit cards in 1993
  Key takeaways:
  - Burger King introduced credit cards in 1993, a major shift for the fast-food industry.
  - Using credit cards at fast-food restaurants was viewed as sad and inconvenient in 1993.
  - Cash was considered faster, easier, and more respectable than credit cards.
  - Burger King aimed to encourage card usage despite potential financial losses.
  - Today, cash and coins are seen as cumbersome compared to the convenience of card payments.
  - Visa played a crucial role in developing three key technologies to transform the payment industry.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  This 1993 TV segment, the news is that Burger King has just rolled out credit cards. That should tell you a lot. Burger King prior to 1993 did not accept credit cards, or at least this commercial makes it seem that way. And they interview this woman and she says, I think it's pretty sad when you have to use a credit card when you go to a fast food restaurant. That was a view of someone just sitting in a Burger King in 1993. And a second guy is interviewed and says something to the effect of, I just hope it doesn't slow things down because they'll have to call New York and then they'll have to do the thing and I just hope it doesn't slow things down. And it's like the prevailing idea is that cash is fast, cash is easy, cash is respectable, credit cards are dead.
  Speaker 1
  What this woman is saying is really sad if you need to use debt to buy a burger.
  Speaker 2
  Yes. But even at this point in history, it was viewed as this cumbersome thing rather than a convenient thing to bust out the card rather than, I actually think Burger King corporate crunched The numbers and they were like, geez, for the amount of time we spend handling change, we just want to encourage everyone to be swiping the card all the time, even if they're losing some Money on the interchange.
  Speaker 1
  It's crazy. That was 1993. I mean, compare that to today. And I don't know about you, but I get pissed when somebody ahead of me in line starts breaking out cash and coins.
  Speaker 3
  I'm like, oh my God. What are you doing?
  Speaker 2
  So start us back. I think the last time we checked in on how the settlement worked was around literally collecting paper sales drafts and then starting to mail it around.
  Speaker 1
  Yes. So to get from there to today, three major pieces of technology needed to be built by Visa. ([Time 1:48:42](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e1d9eab9-5622-42c3-bd5f-0744fbb84cc5))
    - **Note:** They create this great innovation of human behavior but they also need to make technical innovations as well. The network required people to make calls once the card was swiped to the other member bank for large purchases to ask if that person was good for it. That’s suboptimal and visa asled ibm to build something like it all the tech companies came in too high so he said fuck it let’s do it ourselves. This did the authentication but they still needed the payment processing on the back end to make the network work so they built an automated clearing house. They invent a new database architecture and create digital cards this leads to their dominance they’re inventing the pos digital marketplace. Visa going fully digital reduces fraud 80% and gives them infinite scale the internet global toll booth is now open. Best business ever.
- The Expensive Olympics and Visa's Payment Dominance
  Key takeaways:
  - $110 million was spent on the Olympics in today's dollars
  - R&D costs less than go-to-market costs
  - First-time founders focus on technology, while second-time founders focus on distribution
  - Visa becomes the exclusive payment provider at the Olympics
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Well, the two, there's the summer in the winter Olympics, but like one year of global events.
  Speaker 2
  That's about $110 million in today's dollars. Yeah, wild.
  Speaker 1
  Way more than they spent on any of the technology projects that we were just talking about.
  Speaker 2
  I mean, yeah, R&D cost money, but go to market costs more. Yeah.
  Speaker 1
  It's the line, first time founders focused on technology, second time founders focused on distribution. Yep. And then the real kicker, they of course become the exclusive payment provider at the Olympics. So everybody now coming to the Olympics, which is like a lot of people from around the world that are going to the Olympics, the only payment card provider accepted there is Visa. So they're training all these people that are going to the Olympics year after year after year. ([Time 2:22:58](https://share.snipd.com/snip/dc3e4d4e-49bd-471e-a7e9-2857fee78169))
    - **Note:** First time founders focus on product second time focus on distribution. They got exclusive rights to the Olympics which was a massive opportunity. Incentive allignment in the system is really strong you have 5 people in value chain consumer merchant both of their banks and visa getting something in the transaction. The incentives and inheritia are too strong to subvert. Visa has 98% gross and 50% net income margins insane.
