### Highlights

- Prioritized hiring smart people with little to no experience the quintessential hire A players. This group went on to define tech over the next 2 decades. Seeing the past helps you better understand the future. Go to the source. Talent is found in non conformists and rebels and that what PayPal hired. Ben Franklin came from a family on non conformists who were eager readers and writers never afraid to have their own opinion.
  Experts always know the limitation and why something cannot be done if you want to stunt innovation hire a group of experts. They would have so much good advice they would do little work - Henry ford.

    - **Note:** PayPal hired a bunch of really smart inexperienced non conformist rebels. Their ignorance was bliss in many ways and pushed them forward. Avoid experts work hard and figure things oit
- Scenius - when ab environment curates talent like bell labs or the renaissance. The company was as cut throat as it was creative trying to innovate in a banking sector that was intentionally difficult to get into. People like a rock polisher. Through putting a bunch of rough cut rocks and letting them churn and bump into each other you can create a beautiful polished product. 
  Max levchin- immigrated from Soviet Union learned to program with pen and paper because he had limited computer time he was very intense and driven and was given a computer as a gift when he moved to America which changed his life trajectory. He loved seven samurai a movie it’s about leadership how a small ragtag group bands together for the fight if it’s life. Metaphor for start ups. 
  Each book gives you a mental model of that person and when you make a decision you can stress test your ideas through their minds and get perspective. 
  Theil - met in a billionaire breakfast club when he was just starting out. Similar to the junto. He and levchin were colleagues and great friends having this foil much like Warren and Charlie is vital to do hard things. They started PayPal in a broom closet and max was living in an apartment with no ac.
- Musk - very smart worked at a bank and realized any smart person could run a bank over with tech. Treat life as a quest and grand adventure. Musk at his first company worked day and night slept in the office and showered at the ymca he was too intense and had never lead people when he sold his bank account when from 5k to 21mm and 5k. He didn’t see the internet as a gold rush but as a nervous system for the world. He finds the kernel of something and gets to first principles. Voracious reader as well as great marketer. Musk was learning to be a great entrepreneur. He was aggressively risk on he took all his money from his first start up and plowed it in his next venture taking no outside funding. Him putting so much skin in the game helped recruit great talent. He was obsessive compulsive always thinking about the company even in his sleep focused on winning. He believed a great business started with a good idea and intense learning and cutting what didn’t work. Aggressive iteration. People like this are so bloody efficient and smart you can’t believe it and they work 80 hours. They’re self made they’re not Lolygagging they’re insane if you put them in a forest with an axe they would be compelled to chop trees. Always pushing forward.

    - **Note:** Elon lived life as a game and always kept as much skin in the game as he could constantly betting on himself levered long. He is a life long learner and formidable individual compelled to action and hard work. Always moving forward. Default aggressive.
- Confinity and x.com used the same office in Palo Alto they ended up converging on the same business model. PayPal initially wanted to use cryptography to create its own money. Each company thought the other was misguided. It took bezos 50 meets raise 1mm for Amazon and the most prevalent question he got was what is the internet.
  The company iterated quickly except for hiring a players hire a players but b players hire c players. The hiring pitch vs a google type company that can pay more. You’re not going to get paid the most but you can drive the experience instead of being a cog in the machine the workers had agency. Clearly hyper competitive clearly workaholics clearly wanted to change the world.
  PayPal at first did things that didn’t scale.

    - **Note:** The one thing you must always do is hire a players and give them extreme agency to change and shape the world. This is basically on hiring and how to attract the best talent.
- When they did market research they were originally going to build a company for PalmPilots but then realize that no one really add or use them and so they switched to sending money over email. Continuing to iterate am I doing something useful for the customer. David Sacks saw using the palm pilot which only had 5 million users as stupid and came into the interview at PayPal send originally did not get the job but then later I was able to join the team as teal valued his ability to speak his own mind. The whole company was using the email payment but still thought that the app is going to be for the palm pilot they struggle to pivot likewise Elon was down to his last five employees and the company was in Dire Straits company what exit only a couple years later for 180, million. Shows the dark times and success from the ashes. Elon led from the front.

    - **Note:** PayPal built for the iPhone that didn’t exist you need to build for the network effect that exists. They did this with email and were successful. They almost failed but then from the death they became a billion dollar company.
      David sachs got hired because he spoke his mind.
      The palm pilot pivot saved the company.
- There’s no speed limit in life the standard pace is for chumps. Musk also invented e-mail money transfer. The company has many other products and complex offerings at the money transfer what is the most useful it’s not about how much work you put into your product it’s about the value that the customer gets from it. Take something that exists and marries it a fast growing tech.
  Sachs Took over product and wanted to simplify it there were seven pages you need to go through to sign up and he wanted to make it one he put on the company wall make it as easy as email. Great ux. They had someone reach out for product support for their eBay listing and when I looked into it I realize that everyone on eBay was using PayPal

    - **Note:** There is no speed limit or limits in life just what you set. Products are about the value they create not the work you put in. Great UX is vital to any products success. Convergent evolution between Elon and PayPal. Simplicity is key.
- Theil and musk had low tolerance for bs.
  Confinuty and x.com get in a massive fight for market dominance and try to kill each other the issue is that they were evenly matched. They grew to respect each other but Elon saw it as a surrender in a winnable war. The company was easy to start but hard to keep alive these people fought for decades to do this. Theil saw the macro landscape shifting as the world was in a bubble and wanted to close a round of funding almost immediately after the round was closed the tech bubble burst. Their ability to raise money at this time gives them runway and a lot of their competitors died because they didn’t have this runway.
  They had an issue with customer er support so one worker hired her entire family from Omaha to help out they got through the 250k backlog in a few months and the operation persists to this day. Scrappy approach wasn’t will this work but what can we do and how fast we can do it.

    - **Note:** Elon and Thiel were both very formidable competitors and they realize they had to team up because they’re trying to destroy each other. Raising money so you don’t lose before you can win. Unique Problem-solving. Raise money at the right time in place.
- If you have similar paths just take one and do it tolerate failure I’d you can’t talk about the 5 ways you fucked something up you probably were the wrong person for it. 
  Theil gets forced out then musk and sacks fir e out the seasoned exec and take control Shaun the founder may not be going in a straight line but they are steering the ship in the right direction. 
  When you have bigger trans communication is harder and adding more people makes things harder not easier. The 2 pizza team. 
  Company leaders must set a tone of impatience and be intolerant of slowness. 
  Musk realized that the biggest problem was the cost of sending money so they had to figure out how to keep money in the app this lead to debit cards and checks.
- Musk gets forced out to bring theil back musk is unhappy with the decision but knows it’s for the best of the company and doesn’t split the baby these people let the past be the past.
  Musk had a high capacity for pain only months after being outsted in 2002 he declared he would colonize mars.
  Sending money on the internet was a commodity PayPal differentiated through getting rid of fraud.
  PayPal extremely aggressive team focused on action. eBay came up with a payments infrastructure but PayPal won because that was their whole business
  When PayPal is ipoing they didn’t want eBay spreading negative news about the company so they entered into acquisition talked with eBay so they couldn’t talk about the company to other shareholders it was a genius way of keeping them quiet without them even realizing they were being kept quiet
  Do you want to hire people whose last job will be with you go getters and entrepreneurs who will go out by themselves

    - **Note:** Musk gets forced out of his company when theil comes back. He didn’t hold grudges and went to colonize mars after getting kicked out. Self belief high agency and capacity to take pain.
      PayPal had deep focus and a unique value prop. Better than eBay’s focus and safer than other competitors
      PayPal was default aggressive hiring a players only who’s last job is working for you. They entered into acquisition talks with eBay to avoid negative press ahead of ipo second level thinking. A lot of inverting problem
