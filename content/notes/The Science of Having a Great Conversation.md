- Summary: The text explores ways to have better conversations, emphasizing the importance of active listening, self-disclosure, and avoiding superficial topics for meaningful connections. Research shows that deeper conversations, sharing personal thoughts and feelings, lead to increased satisfaction and bonding, while small talk and unfamiliar topics may hinder building a shared reality with others. Balancing active attention, self-disclosure, and discussing shared interests are key for fostering mutual understanding and connection in conversations.

### Highlights

- It’s easy to understand why questions are so charming: They demonstrate your wish to build mutual understanding and give you the chance to validate each other’s experiences. But even if we do pose lots of questions, we may not be asking the right kind. In her analyses, Huang considered six different categories of questions. You can see the examples below:
  **1. Introductory** 
  Hello! 
  Hey, how’s it going?
  **2. Follow-up** 
  I’m planning a trip to Canada. 
  Oh, cool. *Have you ever been there before?*
  **3. Full switch** 
  I am working at a dry cleaner’s. 
  *What do you like doing for fun?*
  **4. Partial switch** 
  I’m not super outdoorsy, but not opposed to a hike or something once in a while. 
  *Have you been to the beach much in Boston?*
  **5. Mirror** 
  What did you have for breakfast? 
  I had eggs and fruit. *How about you?*
  **6. Rhetorical** 
  Yesterday I followed a marching band around. 
  *Where were they going?* It’s a mystery.
  Huang found that follow-up questions, which ask for more information about a previous point, are much more appealing than the “switch” questions that change topic, or the “mirror” questions that simply copy what someone has already asked you. The most superficial are the introductory questions—essential social niceties, but which hardly demonstrate a genuine interest in another person.
  You might also avoid [boomerasking](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352250X21001901)—that’s the habit of posing a question as an excuse to talk about yourself. We could ask about someone’s profession, for example—not because we care how their job is going, but because we want to brag about our own promotion. Emerging research suggests that this habit is particularly unlikeable. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0rhrarea31hvjkmqwv5qwkx))
    - **Note:** Good conversation involves asking good questions that go deeper
- Eschewing small talk in favor of deeper conversations should boost your long-term life satisfaction. Researchers recently [equipped 486 participants](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6139582/) with a small “electronically activated recorder” that allowed the scientists to eavesdrop on the participants’ interactions. The scientists found that the amount of time someone spent in small talk about daily banalities made almost no difference to their contentment, whereas deeper conversations involving the exchange of meaningful information about their circumstances and interests had a significant impact. When you bare your soul, others will often respond in kind—and you will all feel better for it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0rj50pfr7s3565hpzqkqs46))

    - **Note:** Spend time in deep conversations not small talk and a conversation is a 2 player game no one should dominate on either side thats bad. Having real conversations makes you happier and more fulfilled. Be vulnerable to open the room.
- We must look at one final psychological phenomenon, known as the [“novelty penalty.”](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797616685870) The term comes from an experiment by Gus Cooney, one of the researchers who discovered the [liking gap](https://clarkrelationshiplab.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/BoothbyCooneySandstromClark2018.pdf)—the disparity between how much someone thinks another person likes them, versus how much they actually do. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0rjtr2x8tpbkj0vynrs7rs5))
    - **Note:** The liking gap means people actually like us more than we think. This study found that when we rate how much someone likes us after we talk with them and when they rate the same thing our scores are 18% lower, so we think people like up 18% less than they actually do which means we need to appreciate and accept people may like us more than we think
- Whoever we are talking to, and whatever we are talking about, we should be looking for balance—in the exchanges between partners, in the depth of the discussion and in the familiarity of the topics. This is the crux of our fifth law of connection: In conversation, demonstrate active attention, engage in self-disclosure, and avoid the novelty penalty, to build mutual understanding and contribute to the merging of our minds. Whether we are on a first date or meeting a lifelong friend, each sentence we speak offers a new opportunity for greater connection.

    - **Note:** In good conversations you're ideally finding a middle ground not saying fully novel things constantly, so you can bridge the gap and not create a divide. Ideally you're talking about something you both like
