### Highlights

- The Paradox of Progress and Existential Precariousness
  Key takeaways:
  - The paradox of 21st-century life is that while we have achieved staggering prosperity and built sophisticated civilizations, rates of alienation, despair, and existential precariousness are surging.
  - In our constant pursuit of optimization and hustle culture, many people live a checklist existence, where every goal leads to another goal, resulting in a lack of control and uncertainty.
  - Focusing on intrinsic enjoyment of life, rather than accumulating material possessions and achievements, can lead to greater happiness and fulfillment.
  - There is a Western worldview that emphasizes individual agency and accumulating the most stuff and prestige, but this may leave many feeling empty and unfulfilled.
  - Finding happiness in experiences and connections with other people, as well as embracing a lack of control, can lead to a more meaningful life.
  - The book 'Fluke' has changed the author's perspective and made them think critically about their intuitive beliefs about how the world works.

  Now, I want to read another quote that you alluded to it a minute ago, the idea. And I think it's a very provocative idea. And it comes a recent conversation with Paul Bloom had a similar conversation with Agnes Callard. I probably had others. But this question, whether making progress or not in humanity and whether our societies are better than they used to be. And this is this is your quote, quote, this is the paradox of 21st century life. Staggering prosperity seems to be tethered to surging rates of alienation, despair, and existential precariousness. Humans have constructed the most sophisticated civilizations ever to grace the planet. But countless millions need to medicate themselves to cope with living within them. We can control more of the world than the ancients could have imagined, scraping minerals out of the earth, powering them with a flow of electrons we can direct or disrupt conjuring Up images on our screens of wizards and aliens and superheroes that once existed only in fancable, fancable minds. Now we're even starting to be able to invent other minds capable, producing their own art and literature. Where has it got us on every measurable metric? We're better off than ever before. But many of us feel worse off for it. Close quote. Talk about that. I think that's a that might be true. Part of me accepts that summary of modern life. I worry that I've you know, I'm 69 years old and I've just become an old curmudgeon who thinks that everything's worse even though it looks better. But I think there's some truth to it. So what are your thoughts?
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, I mean, I think there's some of this aspects where I do think this is tied to this sort of optimized view of the world, the sort of constant optimization, the hustle culture. And I think lots of people live what I call a checklist existence, which is where every goal yields another goal. Right. And it's just sort of this, you know, there's lots of people have written about the hedonic treadmill and how you sort of, you know, are constantly trying to keep up with your, you know, Ever everlasting stream of goals because if just this one change and I'll finally be happy. I think there's a lot of stuff in life where accepting a lack of control and accepting uncertainty is actually the most useful way you can spend your time and trying to get to that point. I mean, this book also has changed how I think about lots of things. I looked at the pandemic, I'm sure for a lot of people, as for me, did this as well, where I sort of grappled with my mortality a little bit more than I usually would. And I look at, you know, sort of February 2020 and it's like my Google calendar is just full of stuff I didn't want to do because there might be some unknown benefit to my career at some point. And then I started to think, you know, I'm going to die at some point. And I'd rather do things I enjoy. So there's some of that aspects where I think intrinsic, you know, enjoyment of life is something that we're often told is actually something you should put on hold in order to, you know, Complete the checklist and achieve the everlasting supply of goals. So it's not to say don't strive, right? I mean, humans are naturally striving beings and we should be, we should always try to improve our lives however we can. It's just to sort of focus on what actually matters to us. And I think that that's something where again, when you start to think philosophically about some of the ideas in Fluke, you start to grapple with the question of like, is it really the Stuff that I've been told is important, right? Is it the fancy car, the big house and so on? Some of that might be important to people. Some of them might make people happy. But for others, I think they're being sold a recipe that doesn't actually, you know, deliver what they want. So, you know, there's there's aspects of the last few chapters of the book where I'm trying to grapple with the meaning of some of these aspects of interconnected contingency and so On. But I do think there's this, there's this pretty predominant Western worldview about individual agency where you basically are in control of your own world. You're the main character in life. And you're supposed to go through that, that sort of game of life, a crewing the largest slice of the world you possibly can, which is the most stuff, you know, the most prestige, etc. I think a lot of people live their lives that way and then feel quite empty with fit. So, you know, if that's not you, if that's how you feel happy, then by all means, you know, like live the way you want. But for me, it's just to provocatively challenge some people and say like, you know, think a little bit about that. And if you do have a little bit less control, and you aren't able to sort of, you know, order off the menu of life, everything you're supposed to want, what can you make yourself happy with? And for a lot of people, those things are actually free and available. They're with other human beings. They're with other experiences that are free. And I wrote a lot of this book right after I went on walks with my dog, which was, you know, where I started thinking. And that was free and it was really enjoyable. And it's something that gave my life a lot of meaning to grapple with these ideas. So I don't know, it's fine. I just, this is the only book I've ever written that I think has changed who I am. I'll put it that way. The other books I felt like I was transmitting knowledge I already had. And this is when I was talking to people and engaging with concepts, you know, the kinds that you talk about on your show all the time that I just, frankly, as a political scientist who Was sort of sheltered, hadn't really read evolutionary biology and physics and all these other things. And some of the deeper questions of philosophy. And they made me think more critically about some of the things that I thought intuitively were correct about how the world works.
