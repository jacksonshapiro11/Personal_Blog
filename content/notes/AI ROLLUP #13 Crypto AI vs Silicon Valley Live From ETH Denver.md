### Highlights

- **AI Investment Thesis**
  - Look for AI projects with a proprietary model, data, or business integration, advises Tom Shaughnessy.
  - Consider also projects with specialized tooling from frameworks, or unique changes to the reasoning model and inference time compute.
  - These five elements represent key areas for potential investment in the AI space.

  Sorry we've seen venice too but i think virtuals is also fully leaning into the tech side which is nice they launched like their agentic commerce protocol i'm going to mess the name up With the lemonade demo which is really cool with all the agents working together and they also are fully leaning into game which is nice to see too um so yeah i think we'll my my thesis for Ai is to take from Vishal from Mythos VC, who we invested in, is you need a proprietary model, data, or business integration. And now we can add on maybe specific proprietary tooling from the frameworks or changes to the reasoning model and inference time compute. Those are the five sort of areas I'm looking for. Can you actually unpack those?
  David Hoffman
  The first three, because you gave me those in a call one time. I thought that was really useful. The model, data, what was the other one, the business use case? Business integration. ([TimeÂ 0:43:29](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5e8e4c83-5e5c-4db3-9545-05eae0dda3dd))
