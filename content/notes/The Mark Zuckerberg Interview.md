  That's mine. There is a widely held public narrative every single time Snapchat discovers stories or there's something where people are like, oh, the cool thing that Facebook the company did is Just obsolete now, and they're gonna go away. You very much haven't gone away. What do you think is the through line of the DNA of the company that allows you to keep winning?
  Speaker 1
  I think it's that we're a technology company that is focused on human connection, not a specific type of app. So, like, we never thought about ourselves as a website or a social network or anything like that. For me, building this kind of glasses to enable the future of people being able to feel present with another person, no matter where they actually physically are, is the natural continuation Of the kind of apps that we build today. But it depends on how you define what you are. And then you need to figure out, well, how do you build, how do you give yourself the competence to actually go do that? And that's where I think being a strong technology company comes in. Because, you know, a lot of companies, I think, think about themselves too narrowly in terms of, okay, well, we're this kind of one thing. And the reason why we can build all these things is because we are have a really strong technology foundation. And some of that is just me and how I think about stuff. I was an engineer before I got started. I mostly took systems engineering type classes when I was in college. So you talk about Friendster and MySpace and all the scaling challenges they had doing the graph calculations of like, all right, do you know this person? Should you show them?
  Speaker 3
  Friends of friends of friends. Yeah. Yeah, actually, can you take us back? And we want to ask you the story of that time. It seems quaint now, friends to my space, but you study computer science, graph, networking, social graphs, that is a very, very difficult computational calculation.
  Speaker 1
  So I think it's a combination of a product question and a technology question. I think you can define the product in such a general way that the technology becomes basically impossible to solve. So, you want to have a smart product definition, but then you want to be competent and better than everyone else at the technology. And I think that that's something that we've held ourselves to and built a good organization around. And it's one of the things that I observed as soon as I came out to the Valley. That all these companies that called themselves technology companies were not really set up that way. The companies I was talking about, it's like, the CEO wasn't technical, the board of directors had no one technical on it, they had one dude on the management team who was the head of engineering Who was technical, and everyone else wasn't. It's like, all right, if that's your team, then you're not a technology company. I think one of the things that I've always been pretty careful about is I actually want a lot of the people on our management team, it's like, you know, splits mostly people running either Of these big product groups who come up through different technical pathways of the company, and I think that there's like a balance, right? It's like, you don't want everyone to be an engineer because there's other things that matter too, but if you don't have enough of your kind of share of the company as engineers, then You're not a technology company. And I think that that also is important to the board. And I think in terms of how you weigh decisions and culturally things inside the company matters a lot. But I think that's one of the things that has been really fundamental. We're able to go from platform to platform and do these different things because we've invested and cared about the underlying technology. The product experiences that we build on top of that, an implementation and they matter. And for that, I think we also, I think, are a pretty curious and learning-focused organization where, you know, I view the product strategy less as any one specific thing and more as How do we iterate and learn as quickly as possible how to make each thing better for the people we're trying to serve. Right? So, like, I define our strategies, we can learn faster than every other company. We're going to win. We're going to build a better product than everyone else because we're going to get it out first or early. We're going to have a good feedback loop. We're going to get a bunch of feedback. We're going to learn what people like better than other people. And then over time, by the time you get to, whether it's version three, or four, or five, I mean, they're not even discrete versions, because we ship so frequently. You just learn faster. So I think that that's basically the formula. Be a technology company. Build good foundation. Learn from what people are kind of focused on in the world and sit as quickly as you can.
  Speaker 2
  In one of my research calls to prep for this, someone described you as a master strategist. We all sort of acknowledged that at this point. But that the...
  Speaker 1
  I mean, except for like all the stuff that I just thought was not going to be that important, that ended up actually being the most important. It's... But you're very... Well, but that's the thing is, part of it is like, okay, you want to set up the game, so that way you optimize, you create your luck.

    - **Note:** Being a tech enabled company on a mission not being locked into a product vertical. DNA and true north of the company is a tech company around human connection. Medium doesn’t matter. They move fast break things iterate fast ship things they’re embarrassed about so they can have more reps and learn. Iterate quickly. Product being creation vs discovery.
- Embrace Pain to Achieve Clarity
  Summary:
  Strategically navigating success often presents challenges in determining the next steps, unlike failure, which typically clarifies necessary actions.
  The pivotal factor becomes the team's pain tolerance to undertake difficult measures, such as confronting unfavorable investor perceptions. Acknowledging that temporary hardships can lead to greater long-term benefits is crucial; this mindset fosters confidence among team members who recognize that responsible execution can transform challenges into significant gains.

  Speaker 2
  Yeah, and I was like all right like and you're now recently you know I think it was actually pretty clear what we needed to do.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, I think strategically a lot of the time it's um It's somewhat harder to know what to do when you're winning like when stuff is going well It's like what is the next move to like go from Winning to winning more? But when you're losing, it's usually pretty clear what you have to do. And I think a lot of it is like, is just do you have the pain tolerance to go do it? So a lot of this was like, all right, the team was like, okay. Well, we're going public and investors really aren't going to like this if we are not making for a year and a half. And it's like, well, a year and a half is short in the grand scheme of things. Let's do this. And we did it. And it was a painful year and a half. And then we came out of that and we were in great shape. So I think people inside the company had felt a lot better sooner because it was pretty clear to people that we were doing the right thing. And they knew that we were executing in a responsible way and basically focused and we're doing the right thing. ([Time 0:40:17](https://share.snipd.com/snip/28ee7a13-d092-4681-a908-4eee245c141f))
    - **Note:** Harder to know what you’re doing when you’re winning vs losing. Losing is just a just about pain tolerance. He was always working on side projects meetings in his head none of these are that big a deal if the company pivots or dies so what that’s life.
