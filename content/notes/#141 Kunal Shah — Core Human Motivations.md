### Highlights

- Getting Multiple Perspectives
  Key takeaways:
  - People who are good at decisionmaking tend to have multiple personalities in their thinking, and can become different people depending on the situation.
  - This ability to think multiple perspectives is a valuable skill, as it allows people to see things from many different angles.
  - People who are not good at decisionmaking often have difficulty predicting how others will react, due to their limited perspective.

  Speaker 1
  Were saying this, all the people who are seemingly very good at decisions, they tend to have multiple personalities in thinking about situations. They can almost think like five different people at the same time. And they can become different people and find spots of that.
  Speaker 2
  And explain the problem exactly through the lens of that person.
  Speaker 1
  Or instinctively disagree with reject things. For example, let's say we are trying to hire a senior person in our startup. And let's say we have read autobiography of five successful people in life. And we can really live through that thing. Let's say movie characters that we have seen. And we have built that reference in our head on what they would do and say, what this person hired this guy? And it's weird. We'll be able to instinctively see feel from there and say, no, there is no way this guy would touch this guy. Why? Because it's not smart enough to meet that level or is not creative enough and does not have the slope like the way this guy did it. And we always can come up with that. And therefore, being able to become multiple, getting multiple perspectives. So two things I have seen, right? People who are saying, well, red, well traveled is nothing but acquiring more lenses in life to see things. The word unusual starts dying as you travel more as you read more. You are less shocked. You are less surprised because nothing seems unusual. You've seen it all. And therefore, you have acquired different frames. And therefore, most intolerant people who have not either read or travel because they don't know alternate realities. If you ask American, is this the best culture ever? They'll say, yes, but they have never traveled to know and test if other cultures are better. Most Indians would do the same thing. They're like so proud of their religion, their culture. They think there is no framework to go tested. The other perspective is philosophy. Like when I studied philosophy, I had to study Indian philosophy and Western philosophy together as 18, 19, 20 year old. And these are completely different things. Like it's almost like trying to, I don't know, trying to mix Japanese cuisine to like, Italian cuisine to a British cuisine. And you're like, it doesn't make sense. But the moment you acquire these lenses and they all exist. And you can see this from a perspective of that. Oh, let's say you make a decision. We'll Japanese people love it. We'll British people love it. We'll Indian people love it. And then you can come up with this ways to adjust to that based on some of these nuances. And we have this amazing ability to come up with these answers again from our biases. But we have to be able to tap into multiple biases that coexist in us by creating all these multiple personalities in our head and saying that would this guy like it? And I'm like, can see it. And therefore, all the people who are really good at their craft can predict almost like Omar Khase of life. And like, they'll just know that you will love this. And, and, and, and therefore, some people can ([Time 2:07:45](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ea2b6146-f3b3-45e8-a23d-b27ebb477528))
    - **Note:** Getting multiple perspectives gives you different mental models To run ideas through so there’s less surface area for surprise. Well read is just acquiring more lenses in life.
