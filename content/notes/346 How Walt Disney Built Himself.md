  Speaker 1
  But the second reading, after experience reading almost 350 of these biographies and history experience prayers completely changes what I get out of the book, the context, the additional Meaning. And I think particularly, doing it right now after doing Quentin Tarantino, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, Tarantino Spielberg and Lucas all idolized Walt Disney. They studied him intently. He had a huge influence on their work. And so over the last week, I've spent well over 50 hours reading highlighting, rereading the last few days, just really trying to figure out what is the most important lesson that I'm Trying to take away from this book. And in 800 pages, it's absurd to think that you can distill it down to just one sentence. But later in the book, there's this there's this line that has really stuck with me as I go and read and reread all these highlights and notes. And it said that Walt Disney's key traits were raw ingenuity and a sadistic determination. And I sat and thought about that raw ingenuity and a sadistic determination. I think that is a very accurate description of him. Why was he like that? And what you realize is like he had to be he had to have this sadistic determination in large part because his dad, the relationship they had with his father, his father Elias Disney was Excessively controlling and simultaneously unsuccessful. A man that was beaten down by life that failed at nearly every single thing that he tried. ([Time 0:01:46](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d8fb1174-c678-4f50-85ab-c0659d1ae0ae))
    - **Note:** Key characteristics were raw ingenuity and sadistic determination. His dad was a failure and his brothers ran away he took his failure out on his sons. He was always drawing even in 7th grade was the 2nd worst student in class. He went internally to escape then build his own world. He gets so engrossed in his work he doesn’t need to take a bathroom break. Total engrossment for hours after hours. He knew he was interested in cartoons from a young age and built his curriculum and future around it. Escapist and determined to be successful he created himself. Went to WW1 and was in the same company as ray croc. Had a deep self belief that was not well directed or justified he was a go getter without a destination only knowing he would get somewhere. Was always practicing his signature he knew he would be successful. He rode the wave of technology by embracing animation. He got his first job drawing as a high school drop out and couldn’t believe he was getting paid starts and loses his first company by 20. Animation was knew and Disney knew he could go out and be the best animator don’t do anything someone else can. Held a high standard for everyone working with him created his own animation circulum did it to excess. Intense concentration.
- Biography's Power of Progression and Self-Belief
  Summary:
  The powerful biography unfolds the journey of a visionary who starts from creating simple one-minute black and white animated cartoons without sound, gradually adding sound, color, and expanding the duration.
  This evolution culminates in the groundbreaking idea of the world's first full feature-length animated cartoon. Despite initial skepticism, fueled by his father's caution, the individual's unwavering self-belief and independence lead him to persist in the uncharted territory of a developing industry.
  The biography showcases the progression from humble beginnings to the establishment of a vast entertainment empire consisting of movies, theme parks, television shows, and merchandise, powered by four decades of relentless innovation and dedication.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  These are little one minute cartoons that are shown before movies, you know, you start out, okay, well, what's the first thing you could do? The most rudimentary or almost like simple thing you could do? I can make a, you know, one minute animated cartoon is going to be black and white. It's not going to have sound. And then eventually I'm going to add sound and then I'm going to add color. And then instead of being one minute, it's going to be, you know, six or seven minutes. And then he has this idea, which changes the entire trajectory of his company. And he's like, I'm going to build the world's first full feature length animated cartoon. But it's fascinating. I think that's the power of biography. One of the powers of biography is like, you just see it's like, Oh, it starts here. Okay, now you see him learning. Oh, wait, he's figuring out. And then he keeps doing that unimpeded and he lets he compounds for four decades. And then by that time, he's got movies, theme parks, television shows, radio, books, merchandise, everything. And so he calls his first product, laughograms. And his dad is like, you're crazy. You shouldn't do this. Says his father who had suffered so many economic setbacks of his own advised him not to do this warning that he could go broke. But remember, he's the antithesis of his father. While Disney was too independent minded, even at the age of 20, to think of himself as someone else's employee. And that confidence, that unusual self belief is actually going to power him through because it's not like there's a giant market. He's in a brand new industry. ([Time 0:27:42](https://share.snipd.com/snip/62c8eaa2-787b-4b54-b827-c71d4f0c90f6))
    - **Note:** He’s working in his shed on animation he read the only book on the library on it he’s quite literally building the industry and his own world. His dad advises him against it but he continues forward. He starts with small cartoons then scales up there is little demand for these things at the beginning he has the drive and ambition of 1mm men has to starve to create this. He’s sleeping in his office starving and buying food on credit showering at the ymca once a week but he never lost hope his company folded but he never lost his self belief. He needed hard knocks and good breaks. He’s in KC but decides he needs to go to Hollywood arrives with nothing but a borrowed suit and crazy self belief. Success is not a straight line you need to push through. He gets his 1st company stolen from him. He has to start a new one. Disney just wanted to make great products above everything like Steve Jobs the company stuff was second. Opportunity is a strange beast often comes after a loss he didn’t have any distribution rights to his cartoon and his company gets stolen from under him. On the train after he’s making drawings and ends up drawing Mickey the only way out is through.
- Innovation Prevails Over Criticism
  Summary:
  Despite facing criticism from fellow animators for adding sound to cartoons, Walt Disney persisted and introduced sound in the Mickey Mouse cartoon, 'Steamboat Willie'.
  By showcasing the cartoon to an audience, the innovation was well-received, leading to a distribution deal and financial success. Walt Disney's perseverance and belief in his idea ultimately proved successful, despite initial skepticism.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  He's around 27, 28 years old at this point in his life. He makes the world's first sound cartoon. It is steamboat Willie. It is actually the third Mickey Mouse cartoon. But the first two didn't get distributed because it was missing something. And Disney believed that it was perfectly logical that, you know, you're watching other things. They're like, if sound is coming out of live action, sounds how we communicate with one another, why isn't sound coming out of cartoons? At the time people would criticize this. It's a drawings are not vocal. Why should a voice come out of a cartoon character? That criticism is coming from within his field. That is other animators talking to Disney. They said it was unnatural, peculiar, and off-putting. You know what he did? You know, he did. He previewed it. He put it in front of customers in front of an audience and well, how are they going to react to it? I like this. Why wouldn't they like it? And this was the result. I never saw such a reaction in an audience in my life. The sound itself gave the illusion of something emanated directly from the screen. Walt was ecstatic. He kept saying, this is it. This is it. We've got it. And so this is going to allow him to sign a distribution deal. The distribution deal is going to bring money into the studio. But how did he finance Mickey? He borrowed every single thing he had bought a house earlier, him and his brother, who's his business partner, Roy, they put mortgages and second mortgages is on their house. ([Time 0:41:11](https://share.snipd.com/snip/70a4d1d2-c1bf-4f2e-8c44-9816f74966b9))
    - **Note:** He did animation with words which was seen as heresy by even animators but he previewed it and people loved it. First person to do this. Bet fully on himsekf sold his car and took out another mortgage on his house just to release this vocal cartoon steamboat Willie nationwide. He learned to go direct not through dustributors. Refused to surrender control didn’t sell because his salvation was committing to excellence insanely great product didn’t care as much about financial success. Be a yardstick for quality Disney had to be the best. Struggled to adapt new employees asked for commitment from people who never had to do so this inspired quality. This commitment helped him build a brand. He trained and educated his own team and people hated leaving work despite him being a demanding boss at night Disney himself taught classes to employees on animation. Held everyone to very high standards very competitive
- Relentless Pursuit of Improvement
  Summary:
  Walt Disney's unwavering dedication to his work is highlighted through his continuous pursuit of improvement.
  He would work tirelessly, even manipulating the office clock to shield his wife from realizing how late he worked. This dedication stemmed from his belief that being good is not enough; one must strive to be excellent.
  Just like David Ogilvy's concept of divine discontentment, Disney was never satisfied with the studio's output, always seeking ways to enhance it.
  This commitment to improvement led Disney to create Disneyland at the age of 55, emphasizing the importance of continuously striving for excellence in work.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Of. His hobby is his work every moment of his time is given over to it. There wasn't a night we didn't end up at the studio his wife recalled. She would curl up on the couch in his office and sleep while Walt worked. She would wake up at different intervals to ask how late it was to which regardless of the time Walt would answer, Oh, it's not that late honey. Walt admitted years later, listen to this. This is insane. Walt admitted years later that he would turn back his office clock while Lillian slept so that she never knew how late he had worked. And if you know that improvement is his mantra that excellence is his business strategy, of course he's going to dedicate all this time to it. A couple of weeks ago, I did this book. It's episode 343. It is the eternal pursuit of unhappiness. People love that episode. If you haven't listened to it, you should listen to it after this. Episode 343 eternal pursuit of unhappiness being very good is no good. You have to be very, very, very, very good. It's by David Ogurvy and the team at Ogurvy and Mather. And it is based. It's a very short book. It's very hard to find. I think it's sold out really fast after that episode came out. But it's based on Ogurvy's idea of divine discontentment. And Ogurvy describes this. He says, we have a habit of divine discontent with our performance is an anecdote to smugness. Ogurvy had that and Walt Disney had it to never content with the quality of what the studio produced. No matter how good a picture we turn out, he said, I can always see ways to improve it when I see the finished product, his entire life. He wanted something that was living that was ongoing, a product he could always improve. He didn't find that until he was 55, I think 55 or 56 when he made Disneyland. ([Time 0:49:51](https://share.snipd.com/snip/592e7746-5502-4ca3-a06e-b964820fc645))
    - **Note:** He was committed to continuous improvement. He created the idea in the mind of his employees that they were the best animators in the world, and that the future of animation rested on their shoulders culture of excellence like the marines. He built a brand he didn’t care about being cheap he just wanted to be the best whatever the cost and often lost money. He couldn’t watch his old cartoons because he could only see the flaws abs would breakdown and have nervous fits at night panick attacks because of how much pressure he put on himself with the business. Source of excellence is the idea of Devine discontentment because he forced higher standards. This really weighs on him and he becomes very withdrawn outside of work where he has previous been outgoing. He didn’t really care about friends hung out with very few people. Disney invents merchandise and this business grew to be a corner stone of disneys business. Hires Herman cayman who basically invents all merchandise builds 70mm in merchandising in year one in 1934 realized he could make more by merch sales and the guy he hired was the best person to execute in that. He built Disney into a cult. Disney followed his intuition only but it was very tough to tell what Walt wanted unlike Steve Jobs who was very clear with feedback. He would ask for specific changes in what he wanted next. Walt saw the power of story telling above everything. Story telling is the key to success. Had a reality distortion field and was a micromanager with his hands in anything his employees thought he was a god.
- Nurturing Talent for Success
  Summary:
  A successful leader captivated his team with a vision of success, emphasizing the need to marshal resources and stay focused.
  To fuel the growth of his company, he innovatively recruited new talent by sending letters to art schools, attracting 30,000 applicants. Despite the need for experienced animators, he believed in starting from scratch with young students to instill the Disney way of working, ensuring continuous education beyond graduation.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  If it should turn out one tenth as good as the way he tells it, it would be incredible. He was a spell binder. He was a spell binder. We were just carried away. And so he sells his entire company on, Hey, let's marshal our resources. Let's be focused. No one's ever done this before. But if we can do it, we can make it a massive success. Here's the problem. To make a feature length cartoon, Disney is going to need a lot of animators. I love weird ways people hire weird ways people recruit. So what he does, he's like, okay, let's send letters to all the art schools across the country. We're going to list the kinds of skills that we need and encourage people that have those skills to apply. They do this for a long time, not just for Snow White. In the next decade, they're going to get 30,000 new applicants from just sending letters to our school saying, Hey, these are the skills we have. Are you interested in being the best of the best? Apply here. His demand for animators for our strip supply. And so he has to bridge the gap. He's got to hire these like veteran animators and he's so pissed off about doing this. And so he says he griped that when he hired veteran animators, he had to put up with their goddamn poor working habits from doing cheap pictures. It was easier, he believed, to start from scratch with young art students and indoctrinate them in the Disney system. And so their education doesn't stop when their graduate or school and come to Disney. ([Time 1:06:35](https://share.snipd.com/snip/158347f4-b30d-4c60-b7cc-80961041d677))
    - **Note:** Disney is still strapped for cash and he decides to go full length animation which people say couldn’t be done. This leads to his recruiting strategy of sending marketing materials to art schools which like the 30,000 applications in his life. Hates hiring people with bad habits would rather teach people anew and fresh. He wanted his employees to be obsessed with excellence indoctrination bet everything on Snow White. Snow whit was such a success and he is still printing money 60 years after every type of dvd and merch. His dad was bad but he resolved to be an amazing dad. Walt bought his family a house his mom died of carbon monoxide poisoning in it. Great success to tragedy. Walt at this time lost a lot of the power he had after his greatest success he went public and was constantly at the mercy of the bankers the government took over Disney during WW2 and his employees were unionizing and striking. Success isn’t a straight line. He lost control and he needed control he was an incredible micro manager.
- Crafting a Better Reality
  Summary:
  The individual, previously focused on creating internal worlds, has shifted towards building an external world that others beyond his company can engage with.
  This transition is driven by the desire for control, the need to demonstrate the capacity to shape a superior reality outside the current confines. By utilizing his iron will, he embarks on constructing an entire world from scratch, transitioning from the limitations imposed by a bureaucratic environment to a setting where he can work closely with a small team, fostering creativity and embracing new opportunities.
  This shift brings him immense happiness, reminiscent of the excitement of working in a small, agile company.
  By establishing a new entity named WED, he dives into the initial planning stages with enthusiasm and dedication, rekindling the joy of building innovative experiences like Disneyland.

  Like building these internal worlds and then now he's like okay it doesn't have to just be internal I will build his company was an external world but now he's going to be he's going to Build an external world that other people that don't work at his company can actually partake in actually experience and it's all about control it has always been about control about Crafting a better reality than the one outside the studio and about demonstrating that one had the capacity to do so Walt Disney hid an iron will behind a facade of affability and so now He's going to use that iron will to literally craft and build a world an entire land where there was nothing I think it was an orange grove before he developed it and he has no inclination On doing this inside this old because now his studio has essentially been taken over it's like this big old unyielding bureaucracy he's like I don't want to do that so he actually sets Up a bungalow he starts doing the initial work he has this old bungalow at the edge of the studio lot it's a different company entirely and that excitement of working in a small company With talented people chasing an unlimited opportunity is what he's captured again and he talks about this he's happier than he had been in years he's running it through this company Called WED which is his his initials he says so he's in the bungalow all the time in the very initial planning stages working hand hand in hand with the people developing the idea from Disneyland he had this ([Time 1:25:15](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e167f845-2fee-47be-8b14-87d3119592b2))
    - **Note:** He gives up on the studio he wanted to make things perfect and original he hated sequels but now he’s depressed. He doesn’t know where to go. Then he has the idea for Disney land hires a small dedicated team and gets after it. Finds his next acts something he can be proud of compulsive worker. He borrows against his life insurance policy he wants to risk everything. Other movie execs saw tv as a threat but Disney saw it as an inevitable technology and one he could harness so he embraced tv because he couldn’t resist it anyways abd then leveraged it for his benefit. What do you think about all the time find that out and do that. He used abc tv money to basically finance Disney and make them one of the big 3. Amusement parks were seen as dirty but Disney built his to be different he wanted every detail to be perfect. Great brands create their own world and language Balenciaga and Disney did this. He was always improving never satisfied needed a place to direct nervous energy.
