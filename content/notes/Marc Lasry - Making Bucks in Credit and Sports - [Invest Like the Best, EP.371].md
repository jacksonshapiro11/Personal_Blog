  If you think not including the box of the most memorable investment you ever made, end to end, can you tell that story?
  Speaker 1
  For us, TXU was one of those investments where we started buying the bonds at 40, 50 cents. Did a tremendous amount of work. It became a huge position for the firm. We bought a tremendous amount of it. It went all the way up to the 110. And there was one issue that we didn't think was an issue. And we should have sold at 110, and we were holding out for 115. And decision came down in the courts, and bonds went down from 110 to 50, 60 cents. And I learned a lot from that, which was trying not to always get the last dollar. Our thesis was right in what we were doing. And then what ended up happening towards the end is we became an arbitrage firm. And that's not who we are. I think on that, you learned quite a bit from that. You learned quite a bit in 2008. I think 2008 was a great year to learn how to deal with stress, how to deal with things going down, how to understand we were buying Ford Bank debt. We'd start buying it at 80, 90, and it went all the way down for 30 cents. And we kept buying it all the way down. And part of that, everybody goes, oh, yeah, when things go down, double down. It's not that easy. And the reason it's not easy is the market's telling you you're totally wrong. Remember, when you're buying something, somebody's selling it. The person who's selling it thinks it's going lower. As things were going down, the amount of work we kept doing to try to make sure that we were right is the value of that asset, correct? That taught me quite a bit. You had to always refresh what you were thinking and try to look at it in a different way. It's not easy making money, but it's a process. And I think as time goes on, you actually learn how to avoid a lot of mistakes. ([Time 0:39:43](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a9bcf9af-7320-41a8-90e4-0ecf64ea9ba3))

    - **Note:** Dealing with tough times and issues in investing. Don’t over optimize. Don’t hold for the last dollar. Being greedy when others are fearful is something everyone can say but it’s tough to live.
