  Speaker 1
  He's a truck driver who directed the highest grossing movie of all time. He then ditched Hollywood to spend a decade of his life exploring the deep ocean and the heights of science. He's a tinkerer and a dreamer who pioneered tools that revolutionized the way stories are told. Technologies that a generation of filmmakers now rely upon. He spent his adulthood doing things that other people called impossible. As I watched director work, I became curious about a man who seemed interested only in doing things that were hard. And so when I got to this part, it made me think of one of my personal heroes, Edwin Land. This is exactly what he said. He says, do some interesting science that is all your own. And if it is manifestly important and nearly impossible, it will be fulfilling and maybe even a way to get rich. That sounds a lot like Cameron's quote in the GQ article. He's like, I'm attracted to hard. Hard is like a magnet to me. He says that in 2023. And back in 2009 or 2008, when this book is being written, he's like, Hey, I, this is very curious. I started watching this man and he seemed only interested in doing things that were hard. Edwin Land was only interested in doing things that were hard. Steve Jobs was only interested in doing things that were hard. And when you choose the hard path and you put all your effort and focus into it and you were wind up being like you solve the problem, the technical problems that you have to solve, and you Actually succeeded doing the hard things, other people can't help but respect even the people in his field. ([Time 0:20:20](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6eddfb80-f949-4d65-b9b0-26ef9a266910))
    - **Note:** Cameron was only interested in doing things that were hard. He grew up as a truck driver and learned film from the usc library while on the road. He was unapologetically extreme and only did things his way. He wanted to go to the international space station nasa said they could only take him into space. The flight he would’ve gone on was the Columbia which blew up at launch. He is incredibly hard to work with and could hold any job on a movie set yet he commands a lot of respect. He’s made 2 of the biggest 3 grossing movies ever and his productions usually set records for cost yet always make money. His ideas often come to him in dreams he gets up at 5 am to kick box had 5 wives. All other directors like Peter jackson calling him formidable. Cameron believes we can take fate in our own hands. High agency.
- The Independent Mindset of a Filmmaker and Founder
  Summary:
  The individual discussed in the snip demonstrates a strong independent mindset by not following the crowd, pursuing unique interests without being swayed by others' opinions, and choosing unconventional paths.
  This independent attitude is seen in his filmmaking style, his decision to take breaks to explore personal interests, and his defiance against groupthink, even from a young age. His fascination with underwater documentaries and determination to take the hard way in life highlight his intentional approach to personal growth and development.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  He never ever felt it necessary to follow the herd. You see that in the way he makes his films. The fact that this guy literally gets to the top of his freshmen is like, yeah, I'm just going to take like an eight year break and dive the type to the deepest part of the ocean and maybe Never make a film again just because this is this is what I'm happy to be interested at this moment. Not really concerned with what other people think I should be doing. And I think this refusal to just give into the thoughts of other people is like a massive advantage for founders. It says the group think of his peers baffled him. He's in high school at this point. First period meant singing the national anthem and saying the Lord's prayer in 10th grade, grade Cameron listened to his classmates and felt a surge of defiance. It struck me as this tribal chance. In the middle of all this, he sat down, opened his book and started to read this indifference to the opinions of other people concerning like his behavior, something that continues To this day. Something that changed his life when he was a little kid, he becomes fascinated by Jacques Cousteau, who was making all these underwater documentaries. So I think even by the time he got to high school, he was already scuba certified. He winds up begging his parents to let him get to take like a scuba class at like the local like YMCA. And we start to see something. This idea is like, Hey, I want, I don't just want to do scuba. I just don't want to do anything that's just like the normal way. I want the hard way. He is extremely intentional about building himself into a formidable individual. ([Time 0:24:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/da4325c4-8eb4-489c-8fe0-08769576f441))
    - **Note:** James was a rugged individual he was skipped from 2nd to 4th grade. He would often organize the neighborhood boys to do a big project like building an airplane that he would be in charge of. Voracious reader enjoying sci-fi natural leader. His dad wanted him to become an engineer but he wanted to go into film so god patents supported him in doing this.
- Cameron's Journey: Balancing College and Blue Collar Work while Pursuing Creativity
  Summary:
  Cameron, a college student, worked in a precision tool and dye machine while taking 14 credits, showcasing dedication.
  Despite having blue collar jobs, he pursued creative projects like writing science fiction stories and drawing. His friend introduced him to screenplay writing, providing scripts for inspiration.
  Cameron exhibited high agency by working hard, teaching himself scriptwriting, and pursuing a filmmaking education inexpensively.
  Alongside his blue-collar jobs, like being a janitor and a truck driver, he dedicated breaks to writing screenplays, displaying relentless commitment to his creative pursuits.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So it says Cameron was taking 14 credits at Fullerton College by day and then working four to six hours a night as a precision tool and dye machine. As he has got a bunch of these blue collar drops that he's got to work while he's going to college at time. And he continued to tackle his own creative project on the side, which was writing science fiction stories and drawing. Jim was very intense. He was very bright and full of ideas. He was one of those guys that when you met him, you had the feeling he was going to do things. And so he meets a friend at the same college, just got him Randall Frakes and Frakes shares Cameron's passion for science fiction, for ancient history, for exploration. And Frank's is the first person like, hey, why don't you like you should be writing your own science fiction movies. And so he goes and gets all these scripts like the original scripts for very famous movies like Citizen Kane and Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid. And he's just like here, James, take a look at these like what would be considered well written screenplays. And that'll like give you ideas on how to do this. And then you can just get started by doing that. And it's at this point in Cameron's life story where it's like, okay, this is what a high agency person looks like. He's working all the time. He's teaching himself how to write scripts in his spare time. And he's giving himself a graduate level college education, filmmaking education for free or for a couple hundred bucks. This is high agency personified in his early 20s. Cameron held a series of blue collar jobs. He'd work as a janitor, a truck driver, and a machinist on breaks. So he's he's driving a truck like a lunch truck for the school district that he's living by. And on breaks, during the day when he's driving the truck, right, he curls up in his truck and starts writing writing screenplays. At night after a full day, Cameron would go and hang out with friends with Louis that had similar interests. ([Time 0:29:18](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d6b56b90-fe4b-4408-be1d-7122aeb45f9d))
    - **Note:** James embodied a high agency person going to college full time working a part time blue collar job and teaching himself to write screenplays in his freetime. Getting a world class college education in movie making for only a couple hundred bucks. He did everything with overwhelming intensity and vigor. Cameron was reading graduate thesis for the cost to copy them. He had 2 full binders of stuff that he guided his learning with. He got a job at a studio run by Roger korman that gave birth to Frances ford Coppola Martin Scorsese among others as a model builder. The lowest rung. He within days was acting like the head of the model shop and was asked at 3 am when he was sleeping at work if he would like to take over as art director for a new film. He said yes despite knowing nothing about it. High agency believed he could learn anything. Benefit to not knowing what you don’t know he just did crazy things because he believed he could. He then asked to be second set director creating a job for himself where he worked at night. This lead to his first directing gig. Constantly pushing not believing the box he was put in. After 5 days he gets fired from his first directing gig. This lead him to thinking of the idea for terminator but at 27 he was broke unemployed and depressed. Excellence is the capacity to take pain.
- The Partnership of James Cameron and Stan Winston
  Summary:
  James Cameron and Stan Winston formed a partnership based on mutual respect for each other's artistry and shared eccentricities.
  Their collaboration led to Winston winning three out of his four Academy Awards for the work he did on Cameron's films. Together, they co-founded a visual effects company called Digital Domain in 1993.
  Similar to George Lucas, Cameron had visionary ideas for visual effects in his films that led him to establish his own special effects company, reflecting their determination and innovation in their respective fields.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And I just wrote that many pages per hour, he said. And so it's all while he's working on the pre-production for the Terminator getting ready to shoot the movie, he winds up meeting another like high quality person. They want to be coming partners. It's getting Stan Winston. And so this is James describing the partnership. Stan and I clicked early on because we both respect the artist and he saw one in me and vice versa. And we were both a little crazy and enjoy each other's eccentricities. The work that he did for Cameron in subsequent films would earn Winston three of his four Academy Awards and would lead to their co-founding a visual effects company called Digital Domain in 1993. If you study the career of George Lucas, I covered him all the way back on episode 35. I'm going to reread that book and do an episode on it again in the future. But this is something that Lucas and Cameron have in common is they were constantly had ideas on how visual effects and things they wanted to do in their films that they couldn't figure Out how to do. So their solution was a little insane. They're like, oh, well, I'll just found my own special effects company. So Lucas famously founded Industrial Light and Magic. Cameron's going to wind up being a customer of theirs. And then James does the same thing when he found Digital Domain with Stan Winston in 1993. And so once the production on Terminator begins, we see something that was echoed in the GQ piece, the fact that people call anybody that works with James, they call him the do it yourself. ([Time 0:39:59](https://share.snipd.com/snip/29ac9922-7f09-473a-87d9-b98d88304e8d))
    - **Note:** Cameron write the original terminator sequel to Rambo and sequel to alien scripts all at the same time. He divided the waking hours by the estimated pages and stick to that count. He believed in a diy mentality. When he couldn’t get the special effects he wanted he created his own fx company. He did this all in a recession when rates were 17%. He’s obsessed with control and loved his work. He hated writing and saw it as a natural evil that he needed to get done. He had just made terminator and was ascending to the top of the profession all in that time he needed complete control. He’s willing to let ideas sit for 2 decades before he has the means and ability to make the movie. When he worked in a set with b players he was infuriated and vowed to never come back. A players only want to work with other a players. He was unapologetically extreme in this and couldn’t handle amateurs.
- James Cameron's fascination with water and letting ideas marinate for decades
  Summary:
  James Cameron's main theme in his life and career is his willingness to let ideas marinate for decades.
  This is clearly observed in his fascination with water which has been a consistent source of inspiration throughout his life. His movie 'The Abyss' originated from a short story he wrote at the age of 16, influenced by underwater documentaries.
  Cameron's preference for shooting in water stems from the fact that it is a challenging task with less competition, aligning with the idea of tackling hard tasks where there is less competition rather than seeking the easy way out.
  This long-term commitment to ideas and embracing challenges sets Cameron apart and serves as a valuable lesson for entrepreneurs.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So if you were able to see all my notes that I have in this book, I have these like main themes that I keep writing down because they just keep reappearing. And then I when I went back and started thinking about like what I wanted to talk to you about, I would continue to add to them. And so one main idea where main theme in James, the life and career of James Cameron is that he's just willing to let ideas marinate for decades. In many cases, you know, he can't figure out how to make what he wants to do or he has an idea and he doesn't get to actually make that idea like 25 years. In this case, there's 19 years between this idea and the execution. Water and its mysteries would be in a biting source of fascination and creative stimulation for Cameron throughout his life. One that would inspire him to make his most grueling and personal movie. This movie called the abyss. The abyss began as a short story that Cameron wrote when he was 16 when he was devouring Jock Cousteau's underwater TV documentaries. And so this is something that he's going to work on for his entire life. He loves shooting in water for the precise reason that nobody else likes shooting in water. Let me quote Edwin Land again, don't do anything that someone else can do hard. The harder something is, the less competent competition there actually be. I think this is something I see a lot of like entrepreneurs like struggle with is like they try to look for like the easy way. I was like, no, that's the exact wrong thing you should be doing. You should be doing it. You should be trying to avoid competition all times. ([Time 0:43:51](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ca4f6276-c30b-4143-b63b-4f8a2447175f))
    - **Note:** Don’t do something someone else can competition is for losers. Cameron loved shooting in water because others couldn’t. He likes things because they are hard that’s what attracts him. Needs hard he built the worlds largest underwater set where he spent days preparing to film. Magic of compounding he experimented with cgi in the 90s and this made him an expert benefits accrue to those who don’t quit. Photoshop was invented so they could do terminator. But excellence was expected regardless of how tight the timeline was. He was relentless in his quest did perfection and optimized for ownership and agency. They went all in on cgi go all in on where you think the future is regardless of where you think the world is now. Mute the world and build your own world. He doesn’t know the gossip of Hollywood though.
- James Cameron's Intuitive Approach to Movie Selection
  Summary:
  James Cameron's movie selection process is driven by his intuition and interest in themes, rather than industry trends or opinions of others.
  He chose to work on 'Titanic' after 'True Lies' based on his fascination with exploration and the challenge it presented. Despite doubts about the project's feasibility, a fax from explorer Saggol Vitch inspired him to pursue something extraordinary, viewing the movie-making process as an odyssey.
  Cameron's deep desire to explore the real Titanic wreck further fueled his commitment, leading him to invest in developing the necessary technology for the filming.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  He's not concerned with pulling his head up and looking around like, what what other directors think or what does everybody else in the industry doing? It's irrelevant to him. And you see this in how he picks his movies. He's trying to figure out like, what am I going to work on next after True Lies? And this is where he decides to do Titanic, which at the time becomes the most, you know, the most successful movie of all time. What movie he makes next is decided intuitively based on themes that interest him at the moment and what new technical or dramatic territories he wants to explore. I had a lot of doubts about doing Titanic, he says. Could it be done? I wasn't sure. Could the deep dive filming be done? I don't know. Could we create the technology? I don't know. Would anyone want to see it? While he was ruminating on what to do next, he received a fax from this other guy, this this explorer named SaaS, Saggol Vitch. And so he's reading Saggol Vitch's thoughts. And I love this idea because I find this to be true as well. When I listen to podcasts or when I read books that just one line can change everything. And so he's reading this, this fax and it says, it is sometimes necessary in life to do something extraordinary. In Cameron's mind, that line seemed to grow to glow on the page. Yes, I realize sometimes you have to do something extraordinary, something crazy. And this is the line I mentioned earlier, I am an explorer at heart and a filmmaker by trade. And so he looked at creating Titanic, making the movie not as I'm making a film. I'm going on an exploration. I'm going on an odyssey. And then he has this great thing where one of the reasons he wanted to do the film, because he's been fantasizing about diving down to the wreck. I think it would cost I think it was like $6 million or something like that to develop the technology to do it safe. And I think he went down, you know, maybe a dozen times, maybe even more. ([Time 0:59:44](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b682fbd3-459b-4b16-a649-b5721154164f))
    - **Note:** Explorer by heart and filmmaker by trade. Sometimes you need to do something crazy and extraordinary. Cameron went to visit the titanic as part of a marketing expense for titanic. Very detail oriented little things add up to the big things. Confidence believes achievement. Titanic was way over budget and the laughing stock of Hollywood. Critics don’t know shit. It’s always darkest before the dawn the movie seemed like a failure and it ended up being the most successful movie ever. Non consensus and right. Fuck you money and attitude. He started writing avatar 30 years before he made it the tech needed to be right. He also gave up on film making during his most productive years because he wanted to be an explorer. What is obvious to you that’s non obvious to everyone else
