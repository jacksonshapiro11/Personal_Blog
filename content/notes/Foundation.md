    - **Note:** Gaal this great future mathematician is going to trantor which seems important
- “Subjective matter of opinion, Gaal. If you’re born in a cubicle and grow up in a corridor, and work in a cell, and vacation in a crowded sun-room, then coming up into the open with nothing but sky over you might just give you a nervous breakdown.

- “As Trantor becomes more specialized, it becomes more vulnerable, less able to defend itself. Further, as it becomes more and more the administrative center of Empire, it becomes a greater prize. As the Imperial succession becomes more and more uncertain, and the feuds among the great families more rampant, social responsibility disappears.” “Enough. And what of the numerical probability of total destruction within three centuries?” ([Location 292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1PWA&location=292))

    - **Note:** Interesting irony juxtaposition. This might be some later stage empire beliefs prizing the men of allocation over the men of creation. Societies only grow through creation and when this backwards thinking is happening it is a clear sign of the society falling apart. The doctor is below the civil servant of the bureaucracy

    - **Note:** Past dependence and us being a product of our environment
- “But wheah’s the necessity? It seems an uncommonly woundabout and hopelessly wigmawolish method of getting anywheahs. Look heah, now, I’ve got the wuhks of all the old mastahs—the gweat ahchaeologists of the past. I wigh them against each othah—balance the disagweements—analyze the conflicting statements—decide which is pwobably cowwect—and come to a conclusion. That is the scientific method. At least”—patronizingly—“as I see it. How insuffewably cwude it would be to go to Ahctuwus, oah to Sol, foah instance, and blundah about, when the old mastahs have covahed the gwound so much moah effectually than we could possibly hope to do.” ([Location 896](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1PWA&location=896))

- When Holk, after two days of steady work, succeeded in eliminating meaningless statements, vague gibberish, useless qualifications—in short, all the goo and dribble—he found he had nothing left. Everything canceled out. ([Location 977](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1PWA&location=977))

    - **Note:** This is some social commentary on nonsensical beauracracy and how everything people do is wasted and low leverage don’t disagree and it’s a bit nihilistic but partly true as well. Kinda like organization kid just does what he’s told without thinking creating no value but just living some cookie cutter life. Life path.

- You and I both know that the armament he now has could defeat Terminus handily, long before we could repair the cruiser for our own use. What does it matter, then, if we give him the cruiser as well? You know it won’t ever come to actual war.” ([Location 1357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1PWA&location=1357))

- It could not handle too many independent variables. He couldn’t work with individuals over any length of time; any more than you could apply kinetic theory of gases to single molecules.

- They don’t know what I’m doing here and I don’t know what they’ve got here. But I’m in the weaker position because I’m one and they’re an entire world—maybe with atomic power. I can’t afford to be the one to weaken. Sure it’s dangerous. Sure there may be a hole in the ground waiting for us. But we knew that from the start.
