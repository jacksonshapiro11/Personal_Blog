### Highlights

- Elon Musk's Inspirational Reading Habits and the Power of Biographies
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I didn't have any one person who was a mentor, but i always looked for feedback from a historical context, which was books, basically. And so that prompted a follow questionwell, were you readingk general business books? And elon said, i didn't read general business books. I like biographies and autobiographies. I think they're helpful. And elon goes on to to give an example of saying, i really liked franklin's auto benjamin franklin's autobiography. And the the biography of benjamin franklin, written by walter isaacson, and he said, you know, franklin was an unch printer. He started from nothing. He was basically a runaway kid. He created his printing business, but he also did science and politics, and he's one of the people i most admire. And so i thought that was really interesting. And so i started reading a bunch of biographies. And the more biographies i read, the more people i learned about. Realized that people that live livesthat were so remarkable that somebody wrote a book about them. We are talking t the smallest percentage of people in all human history, thet live lives so remarkable that somebody writes a book about them. They all read biographies. And not only do they read biographies, they talk about reading biographies. So they're studying the lives of great people that came before them and taking ideas that these great people discovered and applying it to their own work. There's a good chance of the te odge printer you might most admire does this as well. There's a list. Now, as i keep going through all these books, i keep a list of all the people that talk about this. ([Time 0:00:44](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2e174c0f-84f0-4b60-aa26-e8eebd803605))
    - **Note:** Learn from every experience learn the underlying principle of that experience the Meta lesson. This project collected and leveraged the best prople to build something incredible the bomb. Team of a players in war time. General groves made massive altering decisions and was accustomed to making and living with them. He never would relinquish his role in doing this. Never passing responsibility. Groves built the bomb and pentagon. Formidable individual. Groves was a task master who would put his workers to the screws in everything he did he pushed people to do their best and was definitely a hard ass. He demanded excellence very high standards. He didn’t believe in praising for a job well done as everything could always be better. He works people very hard and pushed them to their limits. He was egotistical airways knew he was right and pushed people to work as hard or harder than him but every country tried to build a bomb and only he succeeded. Groves too over the project from Marshall. Marshall couldn’t push the project at the speed needed. Jordan they were deceiving themselves about what the gane required. Nobody thought it would suceeed and he didn’t want the job but once he got it he realized it would define his career.
- Working with General Groves on the Manhattan Project
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  He liked a demonstration of spirit and independence in the people he worked with. Grove's style was to delegate whatever he could and then put the screws to the delegees. He was a taskmaster. He was a task master. And he had extremely this is something he's going to share common with a lot of the people that you and iave suty on the potcass, he has extremely high standards. So this colonel nichols, is going to tell us what it was like working with him. Nichols remembered inspecting a a construction site with groves. The general criticised the project at every stage. When when asked, when he asked him if he ever praised anyone for a job well done, groves said, no, i don't believe in it. No matter how well something is being done, it can always be done better and faster. But nichols was smart enough to see through groves gruff persona to the results that he was achieving. So before i read this to you, he's they called a frank assessment. So this is his subordinate talking about, what is your opinion of the job that your boss, groves did? It is important to understand that the manhattan project started because of intel a that the germans figured out a way to develop nuclear weapons. And that was in 19 39, several years before america officially got and involved in word or two. But the reason i bring tht your attention is causeit is not just germany, once the news came out, it was germany, russia, britain, japan, the united states, all trying to accomplish the same goal. ([Time 0:15:59](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0752eb28-1f87-44fa-851a-f74ee800e14c))
    - **Note:** Oppenheimer was incredibly smart and practical but hadn’t achieved anything of note his career was kinda floundering. People were shocked he got the opportunity given his lack of admin experience. Oppenheimer was 40 he hasn’t really done anything of consequence despite being a genius. They were fighting the Germans and they thought they were under threat of all our nuclear extermination needed a full speed all out attempt. Groves was rude with everyone but evenhanded with Oppenheimer even light because he knew how deep his commitment was. They went from nothing to bomb in 27 months. They also had to convince people to move to the desert give up on their research and commit with little vacation or rest. He needed to sell the mission. Finding talent was the most important and hardest thing that made the difference between their success and everyone else’s failure.
- Recruiting for Los Alamos: A Complex Task
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  You have to build, ifte have hereis lk. It's like having to build a factory before you can even start to build a the business. And it'slike, later on i realized, no, no, its. It's even more complex than that. And from oppenheimer's prespective, his difficult is doubly hard because he's having to recruit. He has to get the single most talented people he possibly can and convince him to go to the middle of nowhere, in a desert. So im goan to read about that, because i think the book the author describes is better than i could oppenheimer had compiled a primary list of people he wanted at los alemos, but he knew that considerable recruiting was still to be done, and that would not be easy. The prospect of coming to los los am alamos aroused great misgivings. This is oppenheimer. Now, if was to be a military post men were asked to sign up, more or less for the duration of the war, restrictions on travel and on the freedoms freedom of families to move about would be severe. To overeno what he does here, i smart. He's not pitching you a job. He's pitching you a mission. To overcome these objections, he had to frame the invitation as both a great scientific adventure and an act of patriotism. Groves believed that one of alpenheimer's strongest talents was communicating and working with his scientific colleagues. And that's something that's important to point out. Without groves and without they both needed each each other. Their part ship is what allowed for the successful completion of the project. ([Time 0:27:01](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2cf17686-8e29-43be-98c1-8e916fa1a2eb))
    - **Note:** The recruitment was difficult and constantly groves was coaching Oppenheimer on management. If you’re not spending 90% of the time teaching you’re not doing your job. There is managing by understanding the big picture or mastering details jobs and groves/Oppenheimer did both. The only way you develop your people is you spend a ton of time teaching them what’s important so they know you. To atttact their best talent you need to give them an opportunity other people can’t Elon did this at SpaceX. Everyone knew they could be part of history and this was the attractor. Groves worked relentlessly at full speed and hated how lazy other people were he scorned them. He new every day mattered and if you could save even a day you needed to report that. Groves was blunt forceful really smart hired only a players clear organization structure hated stupidity and sloppiness and was open to criticism. He treated Oppenheimer with respect and deffetence.
- Groves realized how difficult the task was and how he needed to constantly motivate Oppenheimer. Groves sensed the lack of confidence and sought to inspire because he knew what he could do and that he needed him. Groves got shit done when there was an expert or part needed he could use his great network to reverse sales and connect with people like the head of gm. He was also ruthless when a reporter revealed details about the secret project he tried to send him to Japan the man was 60 so it didn’t happen. Oppenheimer feared failure and was not confident groves gave him a background. They needed to build an entire city from scratch. They also needed edge walkers people who were willing to risk everything to be successful because the task was very risk. Radiation death was an especially bad death after exposure. An organization needs a single leader you can’t have 2 sources of truth. Their deep similarities intelligences and was what combinded to lead this massive undertaking and make it successful. There are differences but deep similarity is what drives great people to success. ([Time 0:32:10](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9ed70da7-91bb-4c50-ba79-bc35fb00fcaf))

    - **Note:** Oppenheimer realized groves needed constant motivation so he adapted his management style to provide that. Groves leveraged his network to get shit done. He built a city in the desert from nothing.
- There was not a crazy amount of progress by January or February of 1945 the bomb was dropped only a few months after and this is when groves kicked his pressure up into high gear. They had many prototypes but groves cut the bs and made the testing start froze the designs which had lead to the project being stuck for months. Groves pushed it forward. Pursue multiple paths until the problem is solved and accept the unanticipated as normal with these big projects the tail events happen often because there are so many variables one will be 3 stdev. Groves was very careful and limited what his people could do to maintain complete secrecy. There was a high chance of failure in this project. The people were super worried and became frantic and on edge. Tension was incredibly high. Groves maintained the calm and kept the atmosphere steady leading from the front during this tense time.

    - **Note:** A great leader maintains the calm under pressure and groves surely did this when the bomb was dropped it was the product of so much work with a high percentage of failure. They mobilized this effort so fast the war time mentality of ever day mattered and A players came together to do something amazing near impossible.
      Groves was formidable and realized you need to push the project forward and start testing you can't languish in theory for too long or you lose momentum
      Complex systems with many inputs are always exposed to tail risk because if you have 1000 parts 30 are expected to have a 3rd stdev event using the normal curve
      Take the time you need push yourself to come up with ideas wartime mentality of going fast and then test them in the world and commit don’t languish in theory. There are always tail risks
      Calm under pressure wartime mentality tail risks commit to a path go fast. Decision is cutting off all other paths to commit to your best guess.
