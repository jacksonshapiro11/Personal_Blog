- Learn from Mistakes to Build Better Foundations
  Summary:
  The development of Google Maps embodies the importance of learning through experience and adapting when faced with challenges.
  Initial efforts faced significant technical hurdles and an evolving code base that became overly complex due to poor foundational choices, such as the overuse of XML and a lack of browser compatibility. The project's initial messy state underscored the necessity of addressing hidden complexities in new technologies.
  However, these difficulties paved the way for valuable insights that led to a complete rewrite of the system.
  This process was informed by past mistakes, enabling the architect to create a more efficient and reliable code base optimized for performance.
  Ultimately, smaller, empowered teams can overcome significant hurdles more effectively than larger committees by fostering an environment where quick decisions can be made based on accumulated knowledge.

  Speaker 1
  It couldn't go back in time and pass the browser, but they'd figure out like, what was going on so we could work around it. So by the time we had launched Google Maps, and then subsequently added satellite imagery to it, we launched in February of 2005 and added satellite imagery in August of I'm remembering Correctly. It was just the code base was this accumulation of hard one lessons, almost like you had started with a house that was just like a living room and added bedrooms and kitchens and different Remodel stages. One of them was just banging our head against the wall and trying to figure out this technical problem. And like this code base had turned into this total mess. And it was in part because we had no idea what we were doing at any stage of the project because we're literally doing research about how to actually make all of this work properly. We were trying to get, at least this is my memory, it might be embellished through the lens of bad memory and history, but we were trying to get it work well in Safari, which was at that point A nascent web browser. Safari has become more important because of mobile phones, but it was just a new browser on the Mac. Half the hacks that we had just weren't working properly there. And the messiness of that code base and all of the lessons and it was overusing XML, which was super trendy at the time, good riddance. I don't think anyone would use it for most web things today. It was very clear that we were building on a really crappy foundation. I ended up with the benefit of having experienced all the hard-line lessons from the whatever, six months or so we had been working on it. I just rewrote it. And I rewrote it with all the knowledge that we had accumulated. I think the story is a little bit overblown. I did rewrite it, but it was based on all the lessons I learned. So I was just like, I took all the lessons that the team had collectively learned in that time. And I basically said, if I knew all this at the beginning, here's how I would architect the system. And I think I would have had the benefit of having been a part of all the mistakes that we had made up to that point and the benefit of those lessons. And I think had the luxury of starting from a blank sheet of paper with all those lessons. And the main goal at the time was to get the bundle size, which is the size of the JavaScript your browser would have to download before showing a map down. We got it down to like 20k uncompressed, which is pretty impressive in this day and age. And in particular, got it working really reliably on all these different browsers. And there's mainly just trying to get the product to grow more rapidly. But it was largely because you just don't know what you don't know at the beginning of a project. And going back to your original question on the Mythical Man Month, if you have to go through a committee to talk about rethinking something, you'll never get it done. When you have this small team who with a really clear objective and some empowered people, in this case, I was pretty empowered, you can do that. ([Time 0:11:25](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b7755590-d87f-40da-a6dd-95cc2e80d333))
    - **Note:** More engineers aren’t always better. He worked on google maps for 9 months it was terrible. He then rebuilt it from scratch in a weekend because now he knew how to build it and was empowered to do so. It was part already learned part building.
- Embrace the Agent Revolution
  Summary:
  The emerging importance of digital agents parallels the evolution of websites in the 1990s.
  Companies must prioritize their AI agents with the same care as they do their websites and mobile apps. These agents serve various roles: customer-facing agents enhance brand engagement, persona-based agents perform specific job functions such as legal or software tasks, and personal agents assist individuals with personal tasks like scheduling or vacation planning.
  Each category of agent requires tailored development, focusing on unique integrations and effectiveness benchmarks.
  Customer experience and operational efficiency are crucial in creating agents that embody brand values and perform effectively.

  Speaker 1
  In practice, I think the word agent, just like the word app or site in the age of the web will become important to all of us. So one agent that I think is important is what my company, Sierra does, which is your company's conversational AI. And so just imagine you're a retailer, I think you'll put as much care and attention into your AI agent as you do your website or your mobile app, or if you're a bank, and you'll put as much Care and attention to your AI agent, which can help a customer look up the balance of their checking account, or perhaps be an interface to your investment banking arm or wealth management Arm. Or if you're a streaming service, your agent might help people sign up for a plan or upgrade or downgrade their subscription as an example. In that case, an agent is something like website or mobile app that's branded and it's yours. And there are parts of it that are about agency and sort of the AI definition of the word, but more importantly, it's your thing. It's your digital asset that becomes the digital manifestation of your brand. And that's what my company Sierra does. And we think that's one really important part of an agent, just like in 1995, the way you existed online was to have a website. We think in 2025, the way you will engage with your customers will be your AI agent. And we think it's a really important new category. But then taking, okay, what are the other types of agents out there? One will be, I'd like to think of them as persona-based agents. They're internally facing, they do a job. You've talked about software engineering. I think there'll be a software engineering agents that will work to produce software. I was looking at a startup called Harvey, that's making a legal event, which is super interesting. And I think across many job functions, there will be AI agents that produce the output of a, whether it's a paralegal or a software engineer, or an operations analyst, things like that. So that's one. So there's your company's agent, there's a persona-based agent that does a job. And then the third one category, I think is probably personal agents. So this is the agent that will work on your behalf, whether it's helping you plan a vacation or organize your calendar or perhaps triage your inbox and things like that. I think technically they're all similar, but my guess is they're different enough in what job they accomplish for you that there's probably different companies will build those different Categories of agent. If you're building a software to be a personal assistant agent, the breadth of systems you have to integrate with is infinite because different people use different calendars and Different this and different that and there's lots of interesting investment into that. If you're building a coding agent, it's a much more narrow use case but very deep, and you're probably evaluating it based on benchmarks of the effectiveness of the software produced And the robustness of the software it produces. And then for Sierra where we're helping companies build agents, it's about customer experience more than anything else. It's everything from how does it become a brand ambassador? How does it follow the guidelines of your different procedures? How do you actually take all these different facets of your company, whether it's sales or service or whatever's on your website will probably be in your AI agent? How do you actually operationally get that, manifest that as a conversational experience? Interesting thought exercise would be across those three categories.

- Embrace Agency in AI Design
  Summary:
  Customer-facing AI agents represent a significant evolution in conversational customer experiences, allowing for more authentic interactions compared to traditional websites.
  The transition from structured, menu-driven interfaces to freeform text inputs enhances expressiveness, enabling businesses to truly understand customer desires. This shift mirrors the evolution from directories to search engines, showcasing the value of open inquiry.
  However, the design of these AI agents poses both technical and philosophical challenges; businesses must balance control and creativity.
  By providing the right framework, companies can adapt their AI agents to align with their unique branding and customer engagement strategies, revealing unexpected insights and fostering innovation.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, I'll start with the vantage point of Sierra. We help companies build customer facing AI agents. Today, if you're setting up a new Sona speaker, you can chat with an AI agent they built on our platform to help you set it up. If you're a SiriusXM subscriber, you can chat with Harmony, which is their AI agent they built on our platform. And if you're a Weight Watchers member, if you click on the 24-7 live coaching tab in their app, that's an AI agent they built on our platform. One of the things that I think is a nuanced problem that is not strictly technical in nature is just the act of actually designing conversational customer experiences is a relatively New discipline. I remember in the early days of the internet, most websites looked like DVD intro screens, like they're very graphical. There's four big buttons. It's really interesting to go on the way back machine and look at them. And I would say it took a number of years to evolve into sort of the design idioms that we recognize with websites today. And now if you go to a retailer, they'll have a hamburger menu in the top left and the way you filter through items. And these, they're sort of emergent from people's lived experiences, both designing and using websites. And now you can talk to almost any web developer and they'll not only choose similar technologies to make a website, but even the design process and Photoshop or Figma to design a website. They're sort of established practices, some of which are obvious and some of which are actually subtle, like why did this become the way these things are done? And it's the cumulative experience we have building with them. The difference between a website and a mobile app and an AI agent is both the breadth and non-determinism of AI agents. So if you have a menu on a website, you can control what links are there and it's essentially multiple choice. Here's the options available to you. If you have an AI agent with a freeform text box, people type whatever they want into that. And so your concept of what your customer experience is defined by you, but it's also defined by your customers, by what they write in there. It reminds me going back to my web analogiesies here, reminds me of going from like Yahoo directory to Google search, rather than having a taxonomy of everything available. It's just free form. And there's a much longer tail of queries in Google than there was in Yahoo because of the expressiveness of a search box versus a directory. And I think that that's one of the really interesting, and I think exciting opportunities with conversational AI for customer experiences is it's a really authentic way to actually Hear from your customers what they want from you. And I think we've sort of stands to reason, your website was the rails on which your customers communicate with you. And this is so free form that I think it's much more expressive and we've had multiple customers learn things about their customers that they didn't expect by providing this really Free form experience. And then similarly, I think the other really interesting thing when I mentioned non-determinism is the word agent comes from agency. And it's really how much creativity do you want to give your AI in interacting with your customers? I think if you start from a position of control, you can say, I want to put guardrails around everything, but then your conversational customer experience is somewhat robotic. You've essentially defined the multiple choice options of your customer's experience. If you give your agent too much agency, in the extreme case, it will hallucinate. But in the more practical case, it just might not protect your brand in the way that you want it to. And I would say that design question is both a technology question, which obviously we're quite invested in solving and I'm really excited about some of the work we've done there. But there's a deeper question here too. It's actually a philosophical branding and design question as well. And what we're trying to do at CIRA is not necessarily predefine the answers to those questions. I think every company and every brand will have a different perspective on what's correct for their brand experience, but provide a platform that's powerful and expressive enough, Whatever your answers are personally to that question, you can build your agent on CIRA.

    - **Note:** How much agency should you give your agent. Design decisions and ideas change over time.
- Balancing Innovation with Reliability
  Summary:
  The shift from traditional rule-based software systems to those utilizing large language models presents unique challenges and opportunities.
  Large language models are inherently non-deterministic, leading to variability in outputs for the same inputs, which contrasts with the reliability expected from conventional systems. They tend to be slower and more costly due to the complexity and resource requirements of high-parameter models, while conventional systems operate at near-zero marginal cost.
  The innovation they offer comes with the need for a new mindset, focusing on statistical methods rather than purely methodological ones in software development.
  To address these challenges, new processes, like the Agent Development Lifecycle, have been proposed to guide the development of agentic platforms.
  This includes leveraging unique technologies that enhance robustness by having one AI model supervise another. Furthermore, the goal is to democratize AI development, making it accessible to non-experts, similar to how website creation has become user-friendly. The focus is on engineering reliable agents on top of foundational models, aligning with the increasing need for creativity while managing the associated complexities.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And it's a very different mental model for building software systems. Rule-based systems, if you think about just the software development lifecycle that's evolved over the past 20 years, it's really about how you make more and more robust rule-based Systems. How do you ensure that the same input produces the same output, that it's reliable, that it's stable, and that a lot of true innovation in the way we make software to make them more secure And robust. Now, if you have parts of your system that are built on large language models, those parts are really different than most of the software that we've built on in the past. Number one is they're relatively slow compared to generate a page view on a website takes nanoseconds at this point, might be slightly exaggerating down the milliseconds. Even with the fastest models, it's quite slow and the way tokens are emitted. Number two is it can be relatively expensive. And again, it really varies based on the number of parameters in the model. But again, the marginal cost of that page view is almost zero. At this point, you don't think about it. Your cost as a software platform is almost exclusively in your headcount. Who are they at? You can see the margin pressure that a lot of companies face, particularly of their training models, or even doing inference with high parameter count models. Number three is they're non-deterministic, fundamentally. And you can tune certain models to more reliably have the same output for the same input, but by and large, it's hard to reproduce behaviors on these systems. What gives them creativity also leads to non-determinism. And she has this combination of it's, you've gone from cheap, deterministic, reliable systems to relatively slow, relatively expensive, but very creative systems. And I think it violates a lot of the conventions that software engineers think about, have grown to think about when producing software. And it becomes almost a statistical problem, rather than just a methodological problem. And so that's really what we've tried to solve. We shared on our website, but we have a process we call the Agent Development Lifecycle, which is the name comes from saying the software development lifecycle, here's what you should Do with these agentic platforms. It's also we've developed a lot of unique technology to make these systems more robust, with having one AI model supervise another AI model to layer different models on top of each other To produce statistically more robust results. And then as importantly, we've developed ways that folks who aren't experts in AI can express the behavior that they want in their agent. You shouldn't have to be an AI expert to make an agent just like you shouldn't have to have a PhD in computer science to make a website. And I don't think we're there yet, but that's really what we're trying to solve. And broadly speaking, I would say on the spectrum of fundamental research institutions like OpenAI, we're not that we're applied. We're really thinking about how do we engineer on top of these foundation and frontier models to produce robust and reliable agents for our customers. ([Time 0:28:34](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2f0abcfc-4a87-4ecf-a644-02ba2f1eef44))
    - **Note:** Software is transitioning from building deterministic systems to building emergent creative systems.
- Knowledge is Power: Equip AI with Factual, Procedural, and Systemic Insights
  Summary:
  To develop a robust AI agent, integrating three types of knowledge is crucial: factual knowledge provides a solid foundation to ensure accuracy and reduce errors in responses; procedural knowledge empowers the agent to navigate complex processes and deliver superior customer experiences; and access to underlying systems allows the AI to perform actions on behalf of users.
  This combination enables the AI to act similarly to a human expert, enhancing customer interactions and operational efficiency.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, it's a great question. I would say that there's two types of knowledge that I think really produce a really robust agent. One is the factual knowledge of your company. This just grounds the agent so that it won't just make something up. There's a pretty widely used technique called retrieval augmented generation in AI right now that effectively means rather than relying on the knowledge encoded in the model to answer Questions, you present the model with knowledge maybe stored in a knowledge base or a database and say, hey, summarize the content from here. Don't rely on the information you've been trained on. That has been an effective technique for two reasons. One is that it means that you don't need to train or fine tune a model to use it with proprietary data, which is a much cheaper deployment methodology. And it also can be effective at preventing hallucinations as well, because you're effectively rather than relying on the AI to determine what it knows or doesn't know you present the AI with the knowledge that it's allowed to network. It's a simple way of putting it. And that's factual knowledge. And I would say that's necessary but woefully incomplete because that would enable your AI agent to answer questions, but it wouldn't necessarily enable it to orchestrate a complex Process or take action on your customer's behalf. The other type of knowledge is procedural knowledge. If a Sonos speaker stops working, what would the best Sonos engineer ask you and do to figure out whether it's a problem with your hardware, problem with your Sonos app, or problem with Your Wi-Fi? What is the process by which you do that? If you're a subscription streaming service, what is the process of processing an or downgrade to your membership? Are there different offers available based on your membership level? Do you have a promotion running? What's been the most effective technique to keep people a subscriber for a long period of time? This is all the stuff that if you are a person, an expert in it. And so coming in with that knowledge of not only here's the factual knowledge for our company, but here's the processes that represent our greatest customer experiences. What does the best salesperson do? What does the best customer service person do? What is the most effective marketeer at your company? How do they describe your products? And that's often there we work with our customers to improve when they deploy AI. And then the third thing is just access to the underlying systems themselves. I think the AI agents shouldn't just be about answering questions or having a conversation. They should actually be able to take action on your behalf. So that's a retailer processing a return or a subscription service changing your level of membership or connecting to the telemetry system of a consumer electronics company. So we can say, Hey, we know your device phone home, you're connected. We now figured out this other problem. Or even with something like SiriusXM sending a signal down from a satellite to refresh your radio if your radio stopped working. So, three ingredients, factual knowledge, procedural knowledge and systems integrations, I think, are the three key ingredients. And then with the right methodology, your agent can do anything that a person can do on a computer, which is just an incredible opportunity for customer experiences. ([Time 0:31:55](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7683a278-5964-4911-ac72-926c2755c445))
    - **Note:** AI agents have factual and procedural knowledge. A good agent benefits from both. the last one has the systems understanding so the agent can make the decision on your behalf
- Embrace Impact Over Identity
  Summary:
  Feedback can catalyze significant personal growth, especially when it challenges one’s sense of identity and encourages a focus on impact rather than self-perception.
  A leader recognized that trying to be a hero by doing everything themselves hindered team performance. By re-evaluating their role and shifting their mindset to prioritize the most impactful actions for company goals, they experienced both improved performance and fulfillment.
  This reflection led to an understanding that their identity could evolve based on different roles and contexts, reinforcing a focus on outcomes over fixed self-identification.
  The journey illustrates the importance of adaptability and being open to hard conversations for personal and professional development.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  It was probably the largest organization I had ever managed and Cheryl was everyone's mentor at that company. I was probably 29 at the time. She was the old guard and she had more experience than all of us and was not only generous with giving advice, but also would tell you the uncomfortable things you didn't necessarily Want to hear, but you needed to hear on how you were doing. And she had this very hard conversation with me basically that I wasn't holding the teams I was working. They were working for me to high enough standard. The reason why this project was going poorly was basically because I was trying to be heroic and do the job myself rather than grow this team underneath me. It was a very impactful conversation for me because it's one of those, you start out dejected, like I suck, what am I doing wrong? Would reflect it on it. And I was reflecting that I had gone from being kind of a technical architect, a very senior influential individual contributor to managing this big team. And I was trying to conform the new job to me, rather than conform myself to the new job. And that was my reflection. And I don't know if it was like the next Monday, it was soon after that I woke up every morning, and thought rather than come at this with a strong sense of my identity and who I am, I'm going To think every morning, what is the most impactful thing I can do today to accomplish the goals that the company wants to accomplish. And it worked. And the counterintuitive side effect of it was, it was delightful for me. So I had this image of myself as a technologist and engineer and the reason why I was subconsciously trying to conform the role to my identity is I thought, this is my identity and this Is who I am and what makes me happy. Found out through the act of trying to have a looser conception of my identity is not only was I better at my job, but the act of actually just having things go better was very fulfilling For me. And it became this self-fulfilling prophecy, which is I was just focused on how do I achieve the end that I'm trying to achieve, and by having a very loose concept of who I am and I was just Trying to do the most impactful thing to accomplish the big picture like what are we trying to solve, things started working really well. And it was a reinforced to me that's actually what I care about is impact more than anything else. And it's become something that I am very grateful for. I'm very grateful for that hard feedback I got in a sort of vulnerable moment. Because I think I probably did have an overly ossified conception of my own identity. And now it's, I talked to some people who knew me at Google Maps and think of me as an engineer. And I talked to some people at Facebook who think of me in that technology leadership role. I talked to some people from Salesforce who think of me as an executive on the leadership team as COO and co-CEO, and they're all right. In those circumstances, that's who I was. ([Time 1:09:44](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d6344377-eac1-4dd3-967a-8c59d9a014f9))
    - **Note:** Change your identity and keep it flexible. Be introspective and try to see where your stories aren’t serving you. Just focus on the mission and introspect then grow. Do what serves you
- Intensity Drives Innovation
  Summary:
  Intensity is a crucial value for companies in competitive markets, particularly in the context of rapid technological advancements like AI.
  Recognizing that both extraordinary successes and failures can arise from similar market conditions, the focus should be on execution rather than merely having good ideas. Companies need to cultivate a sense of urgency and attention to detail to ensure they do not fall behind competitors.
  Values should be integrated into the company's culture, influencing everyday actions rather than remaining as mere slogans.
  A company that prioritizes intensity will foster an environment where innovation thrives and market opportunities are seized promptly.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  I'm really interested in three of the values around which Sierra has built that we haven't talked about yet. I have a way of asking about them. I'll probably do it three times, which is how you would assess this value in another company and how you promote it in your own. So the first one is intensity. This value was intentional because of the market that we're in.
  Speaker 1
  There's a Mark Twain quote, history doesn't repeat itself, but it rhymes. And I think the AI boom will rhyme with the dot-com bubble. And what I mean by that is that there will be a lot of hype, a lot of snake oil, but there will also be some generational firms created in this wave. In the same way, you had Webvan and pets.com, but you also had Amazon, Google, eBay, PayPal, Salesforce, and others come out of it. Similarly, I think that a lot of the ideas that we at Cira are pursuing and companies like Amazon were pursuing the dotcom bubble aren't necessarily unconventional or surprising ideas Like selling books online or let's apply AI agents to help with customer experience. They're conceptually obvious, but it's all about execution and Amazon got to write the history books, not buy.com and Google got to write the history books, not Altavista or InktoMe Because of product technology, you go to market execution. And so the idea of intensity is we know we don't have the luxury of patience. If you're inventing a new concept like maybe Facebook and Slack did, you exist alone because you've built a new way of doing something. In a model where a lot of the technology is the rising tide that's lifting all boats, we could sit around and pontificate about the future and the world could move on without us.
  Speaker 2
  And I think that was true in 1997 and I think it's true now, and we really wanted to reflect that in our values. What do you do to up intensity inside the business? How do you get more intensity in a business besides talk about it?
  Speaker 1
  For me, it really comes down to urgency and caring about every detail. And I think, like all values, if you think about company values, is it a poster on the cafeteria wall or do you feel it? I always bring up two of the values I really felt early on in my career at Google, don't be evil. And it was really about how we thought about advertising and transparency around it. I felt as a product manager at Google, we talked about it all the time and people were proud to do things differently than the status quo at the time. ([Time 1:15:02](https://share.snipd.com/snip/69b74104-5ed7-471f-b0ca-15c740cdc1c6))
    - **Note:** Cultivate a culture of urgency execution matters. feel your values
- Every Choice Shapes Your Time
  Summary:
  In a world dominated by push notifications and constant communication, individuals must consciously decide how to manage their time.
  Choosing to attain inbox zero or prioritize family dinners reflects personal accountability and intentionality in time management. One’s professional obligations should not overshadow personal choices; it's crucial to recognize that every decision, whether to attend a meeting or spend time with loved ones, is ultimately within one's control.
  Acknowledging this empowers individuals to resist external pressures and align actions with personal values, promoting a balanced life.
  Mastery in saying no and making deliberate choices leads to greater fulfillment.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So I think that especially in the age of push notifications and email, often you can let your interactions with others define how you prioritize your time. That's a choice. If you're going to choose to be inbox zero, that's a choice. It's a completely rational choice, by the way, but your time is going to be a function of how many people are sending you email. And so you're not in control of that time. Similarly, if you have a really intense job and you want to have dinner with your kids, have dinner with your kids. It's just a choice. You can go home or not go home. You can say yes to dinner meeting or no to a dinner One of my mentors, Susan Wojcicki, just passed away and was famously would never take a dinner meeting. So she could be home with our kids and she was the most powerful executives in Silicon Valley. I would just say that I think a lot of people present things as choice is not available to them and I'm not trying to be insensitive to the power hierarchy of where you work or anything like That, but everything is a choice. And so I really tried to be self-critical and accountable about the choices of how I spend my time. I try not to pretend that anything is not a choice. You can quit any job, you can abandon your family. Probably neither or something that most people want to do, but everything is a choice. And so I try to not let the world happen to me. It's very taken me a long time to get good at saying no, it still feels painful, but I've gotten better at it. So intentionality is the short answer.

    - **Note:** Everything is a choice. Don’t let life control you.
