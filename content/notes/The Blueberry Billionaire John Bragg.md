- Embrace Opportunities with Simplicity
  Summary:
  Seizing opportunities often stems from necessity and collaboration.
  A straightforward deal, like a one-page agreement, can lead to long-term success, as seen in the onion ring partnership, which began with minimal knowledge yet thrived over 50 years. Instead of seeking help during challenges, maintaining a commercial relationship without reliance on favors fosters trust and reinforces partnership dynamics.
  The drive to learn and adapt, inspired by the notion that others succeed in similar endeavors, empowers individuals to tackle new challenges despite initial ignorance.
  This story illustrates the value of simplicity in agreements and the importance of self-sufficiency in professional relationships.

  Talk to me about that deal with the McCain's for the onion rings.
  Speaker 1
  Well very interesting I would say typical maritime deal, I went to see Wallace McCain. This is over 50 years ago. And said, look, I need something to keep my people busy and to have you any ideas. And he threw me a file on onion rings that they had looked at, but it didn't fit because they were doing french fries year-round. And he says, well, maybe you can do it. So needing something to do in the wintertime and off-season, we took the file, and we had a one-page agreement, which I still have, which gave us the exclusive right to make onion rings Under the McCain label in Canada. And we've been doing that for over 50 years. And I would say only in the Maritimes, you know. And of course we've had our ups and downs. But in all those years, I never once went back to Wallace or Harrison and said, I need help. Your guys are giving me a hard worked it out behind the scenes Because I thought I could go to them once and I was gonna save that but if I became a nuisance to them then the relationship would Disappear So we've worked all these years and I never had to ask a favor We've done it on a pure commercial basis and I think it's worked well for both of us I like the fact that it's a simple
  Speaker 2
  One-page agreement over a handshake Yeah, but at the time you entered that you had no idea how to make onion rings didn't know how to make onion rings The deal we made is is still going still
  Speaker 1
  One page, but it's altered in many ways Of course over time with investments and so on. Yeah we didn't know how to do it but we we didn't know how to do blueberries either or carrots. What gave you the confidence to figure that out? Other people in the world are doing it. There must be some way you can learn how to do it. It can't be that complicated. This is back in the day before Google or anything. That's right. Like you're not like searching how to make onion rings. ([Time 0:28:12](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d356df0f-0b74-46a7-9fb1-eb244c69fa80))
    - **Note:** You need to have short agreements. 1 page agreement for 50 years. Never asked a favor knew he could only ask once and couldn’t be an issue so he just figured things out.
- Capital Growth Through Strategic Acquisition and Integrity
  Summary:
  Capital requirements for growth in a small town can be met through bank loans and hard work.
  Identifying potential for integration, such as connecting towns with fiber optics, presents opportunities for expansion. A key strategy involves leveraging relationships and trust, creating a reputation for reliability and fair dealings, which facilitates acquisition from other towns eager to sell.
  This approach results in gradual accumulation of assets and market presence.
  However, as companies mature, opportunities for significant expansion become limited, with market saturation and the presence of public companies inhibiting further acquisitions.

  Speaker 2
  Was it capital intensive back in 1968? How is your building this out? So where did the capital come from to build that out?
  Speaker 1
  Well, it was a small town and so, you know, it didn't take a lot of capital, but we borrowed the money from the bank in Nova Scotia, or most of it, and we worked hard. It's amazing how it's developed. But then we could see that you could tie them together with fiber, and we kept, and they kept more capital was required. So a lot of the other towns, the guys just decided they didn't want to put more capital in, so for sale. And my corporate lawyer at the time, George, came and said, John, there's something interesting here. All these towns come up. There's six buyers, but you always get them. And it was basically we became easy to deal with. And we always lived by our word and we always paid top price and so we just kept picking them off one at a time and made it easy and didn't over-negotiate. We gradually picked up a lot of towns and then we bought a company out of Newfoundland that had systems in Sudbury and in Bridge Columbia and Alberta. We just gradually bought them, but there's nothing to buy anymore. I think about this. We have both our cable and food business that were both quite rapid growth businesses, from really small cottage to professional companies. We've played that game and they're both good businesses, but I don't see the next big step.
  Speaker 2
  They're kind of mature businesses.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, and all the bigger companies are public companies and they're not going to sell. ([Time 0:39:49](https://share.snipd.com/snip/bc0a9c16-29b8-4b01-abea-8e6a3a65aca8))
    - **Note:** Be easy to deal with there is no better path to success.
