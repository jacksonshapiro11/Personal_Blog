### Highlights

- To create this integral practice start by understanding yourself through working out meditation and therapy. Then work on strengthening relationships and grow through those. Live with nature and as a part of it. Everyone has an important life truth that must be integrated and transcended until humanity transcends itself. We reach a deep and internal peace in ourselves that expands out to the civilization we live in as well.

    - **Note:** understand yourself and cultivate the relationship you have with yourself. Live with nature discover your important truths then transcend yourself. Find deep internal peace. Find your life truth and north start integrate it and get to inner peace
- We need to give everyone a seat at the integrated table Santa Claus is not more real than modern psychology they are both flawed but explain an important part of development. True integration comes from connecting all these stages at all different levels right now we’re at a developmental babel. We’ll never find the answer but we need to keep searching. Knowledge is fallible but we need to keep moving forward. This all quadrants and levels creates the integrated world view similar to the idea spectrum and the ladder. One is a belief held the other is a way of holding that belief. They are different things at their core. We need to see the Forrest for the trees and understand the green meme has become too encompassing high modern and dogmatic to work and may be hurting the overall system of growth. Hierarchy and growth through it is vital multi disciplinary model of thinking. Tech reshapes cultures in the bottom right. You need an integrated approach or you’re applying tech ahead of its time to people who can’t use it and this causes hardship and conflict. We can’t make people evolve we need allow them to grow on their own. Can’t give a tribal government a nuke.
- How a person and their culture perceive and illness has a great effect on how that illness manifests physically. The laws you get drugs passed and hospital layouts effect the physical illness and the mental health is important. All quadrant all level approach to business. Individual selection group psychology culture systems. Technological growth outpaces human growth because a transcendent person in society can invent something to be used by less developed members of that society not everyone can built a bomb few can but almost anyone could drop one. Manhattan project required geniuses but terrorists can use that tech with remorse. Tech is linear human emotions are cyclical. Tech running ahead of wisdom. Utopia is relative everyone believes they’re fighting for what’s right for their tribe we need to see all humanity as a tribe to move forward possibly. People believe in flawed causes because they are underdeveloped and we need to grow as people to live in a better world.
    - **Tags:** #tech-is-linear-human-emotions-are-cyclical, #perception-shapes-reality, #human-nature-remains-constant, #systems-thinking, #holistic-approach, #utopia-(issues-with)
    - **Note:** our environment effects our perception and how we design our systems we need wholistic approach. Tech is linear but human emotions are cyclical so we can invent tech that exceeds us and it will always be a challenge to adapt new tech to our privative hardware. Utopia is relative and this creates issues
- Integral politics sees both reliance on the individual and social safety nets. You need to not get too self reliant but also the exterior is more than meets the eye and just external factors don’t create the right framework either. Liberals have a high developed more bastardized ideology while conservatives have a lower level of development but more ideology
    - **Tags:** #politics, #golden-mean, #agency, #systems-thinking
    - **Note:** The right political system creates a balance between self reliance and safety nets a golden mean of political system. Have a framework and ideology that balances systems thinking and agency
- Deep spirituality requires the investigation into the higher stages of cognitive development soul and spirit in the figures. Follow the strands of good science. You can merge science and spirituality like hooking up someone’s meditating mind to an ekg. All quadrants all levels. Anything that uses the scientific method can be considered good science. We can’t reject religion any good idea can integrate both religion and science. Keep the good parts rejecting religion just creates new religions.
    - **Tags:** #scientific-method, #open-minded, #spirit, #religion-vs-science, #religion
    - **Note:** We need to meet open minded to all ideas, religious or scientific, and provide the scientific approach to the problem in hopes of learning and gaining a deeper understanding
- Religion can give meaning to the desperate self and fortify the ego and transformative spirituality that seeks to transcend the self in non dual unity consciousness beyond the ego. Narrow and broad religion. Narrow science is the hard science and then a broader one that try to understand social sciences or human sciences. Science starts with measuring or experimentation and collect experiences then you collect data or evidence then communal checking. First look for the rain outside then collect evidence then verify. Good science turns to a community to be falsified. You need to have a way to challange your beliefs critical approach to confirm or reject them.
    - **Tags:** #study-problems-not-fields, #transcend, #systems-thinking, #bottoms-up-and-top-down, #perspective-taking
    - **Note:** Things can be viewed narrowly or widely within the bigger system. Transcendent ideas become influential at the systems level not in some narrow scope. Problems vs fields.
- Science vs religion some believe they both refer to the same world but in reality they establish a world of atoms and spirit and can be viewed as split or integrated. There are levels to reality. Art morals and science become I we it. All quadrants combine to meet the levels of spiritual and scientific
    - **Tags:** #mind-body-duality, #science-and-religion, #spirtuality, #morality
    - **Note:** Mind body duality understand yourself and the world physically and spiritually
- Individual consciousness upper left is combined with upper right the brain the body then bottom right environment social systems and nature left social order lower left communal settings world views and cultural values. These 4 quads come together to form the 4 integrated quads of consciousness. Upper right is hard sciences like biology lower right is social sciences like complexity theory. Top left is viewing things from I bottom left is viewing things from we. The the right side is the objective view of it. Integrated these form a cohesive non reductionist picture. Most of the world doesn’t need the integral vision they just need to survive but for our institutions who have become stale they need less post modernism and more integration
    - **Tags:** #social-sciences, #internal-locus-of-control, #integrated-life, #science-and-religion, #community, #complexity, #perspective-taking, #consciousness, #biology, #systems-thinking, #social-intelligence
    - **Note:** The integrated theory balances the hard and soft sciences with a deep understanding of complexity. Then understands your own perspective and then the perspective of others when this is all combined, you have the integrated view. Consciousness and community are on the left on the right are the physical world and then the social systems we create
- Post modernism invading institutions speaking modern with an authoritarian skew policing discourse. Only accepted one truth while denying truth existed. They basically rewrote the rules to say there was none except everything they said was also right. Humans can solve any problem they want with enough commitment to the problem. Belief in human agency. Post modernism is a backward thinking world. Flatland is the inability to see the entire integral vision.
    - **Tags:** #critical-approach-(conjectures-and-refutations), #post-modernist-thinking, #bad-philosophy, #agency-(figure-things-out)
    - **Note:** Postmodernism has an answer, but also says it has no answer and implicitly accepts its idea as true without welcoming criticism. Be critical constantly seek to improve ideas. Believe in agency.
- Hierarchy is inherent in human and other systems. Each wave transcends and includes earlier stages. Not recognizing this is blind to reality. Nested hierarchies. This is about seeing the entire picture of the complex system and not getting locked into any mode. Post modern thinking the green meme makes so much progress only to deny progress and logic and thus falls apart. In the ability to transcend and think post conventionally boomers had reverted to pre conventional thinking actually going backwards. Growth happens through differentiation and integration. Wholistic world. Global world enables transcend consciousness with a global view. Before change we need to be annoyed and ready for change and let go of the present level. We need can insight into what we want and reality this opens our mind into a wider consciousness. Integral vision and practice. Create integral awareness
- Spiral of development goes from me to us to all of us. New waves provide more problems and challenges as the system gets more complex but also more opportunities into a better world.
    - **Tags:** #complex-adaptive-systems, #philosophy, #problems-(are-inevitable-and-soluable), #problems-(studying-better-problems)
    - **Note:** Society develops outward creating more interactions and complexity which lead to more problems and better solutions
- Second tier thinking is chaos and complex systems thinking with the ghandi or Mandela world view. The different levels of thought struggle to communicate across the difference because their mental models aren’t aligned. The green post modern thinking gets there humanistically but struggles calling truth subjective and relative so there’s no real truth which is wrong and it becomes narcissism which cannot coexist in an integrated world you feel like you’re on the right side and correct everyone else is wrong but you can’t see the issues with shrinking your world view you can’t understand or live with others. Narcissism isn’t just believing too much in yourself but deflating others as well to raise yourself. You can’t conceptualize what others thinking so growing up requires developing empathy. This usually starts with seeing the world through you then through your friends then as a global citizen 3 steps of growth. We need to step out of our shoes and take the roles of others center on group. Then it’s not just about you and your tribe but you your tribe and your world. Each step is decreasing ego and seeing the broader world.
    - **Tags:** #chaos, #global-community, #favorite, #narcissism, #complex-adaptive-systems, #objective-truth, #truth-seeking-(vs-being-right), #subjective-truth, #empathy/sympathy-(understand-others-perspective), #cultive-relationships, #walk-a-mile-in-someones-shoes, #perspective-taking, #humility, #meaning-of-life, #relationship-(horizontal-vs-vertical)
    - **Note:** Second tier, thinking balances, chaos, and complexity with empathy. The issue with some intellectuals is that they always think they’re right and that truth is subjective both of which are false. We need to not be narcissistic, but cultivate empathy first with ourselves, then in our relationship then with the world. Narcissism is bad empathy is good. Take someone else’s perspective walk mile in their shoes. Humility is the key to happiness.
- Integrated wholistic theory of everything that values diversity. Boomers high cognitive capacity and creative intelligence but also a heavy dose of narcissisticism. Strong value of self but narcasism runs counter to an integral life. Development is not a ladder but a spiral and comes in waves. Create overall psychological map of human consciousness that is supplemented with other fields like physics and metaphysics. Meme is a basic stage of development that can be expressed in any activity. Levels of thinking there are 8 levels one is base level subsistence then vodoo magic and tribal warfare. Then a world of mad max frontier mentality and power dynamics. Then mythic order like god rules everyone must follow one way of thinking. Then it becomes scientific world of creation like seen in capitalism or the renaissance. Above this is the one world community where everyone is equal and works together as one system. Second level or tier thinking things both vertically and horizontally each step builds on the previous and transcends you have hierarchy and more community across reshaping those 2. Each wave includes all previous fundamental waves and each of these needs to be used in life. We can’t be stuck in one of these memes but must sit above and transcend these states by existing in all of them. Second tier thinking integration of understanding and seeing the entire system working together looks for the linking contexts and joins the systems flexibility across the nested complexity. Then there’s wholistic a grand unification multiple levels merged into one and the peak of knowledge
    - **Tags:** #diversity-(within-systems), #second-tier-thinking, #second-level-thinking, #community-formation, #integrated-life, #transcending-paradigms, #human-nature-remains-constant, #utopia-(issues-with), #nested-complexity, #communism
    - **Note:** true theory of everything is someone who grows through the lower levels and transcends but integrates them into their life to create a second tier life which transcends hierarchy and creates community. Each step up the latter from vodoo magic to transcendence is informed and integrated by the ones before we cannot lose our basic human nature. Values diversity hates narcissism value of self in integral life. Nested complexity. All utopias are communist but the incentives are always too fucked to make it work
      Voodo magic --> power dynamics mad max --> church and god --> to science and capitalism --> equality across the system. Second tier, thinking is using complex relationships to unite a system.
