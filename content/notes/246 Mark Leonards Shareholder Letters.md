  Mark len reminds me of warren buffet. Anyone who likes reading berkshire shareholder letters will enjoy leonard's the globe and mail describes part of what leonard has accomplished at his company, consolation software. With an initial 25 million dollar investment in 19 95, mark leonard has built consolation into a world leading consolidator of vertical market software companies. These are companies that create products to help run businesses in specific industries. Over the years, consolation has acquired over 500 businesses. Typically consolations acquisitions are small, in the two to four million dollar range. But add them all up, slip in a dose of consolations financial and operational discipline, and you have a company with a market cap of forty million dollars. In this age zero privacy, mark leonard has managed to maintain a practically unthinkable level of anonymity for just about any individual, let alone an executive who runs one of canada's most dynamic and fastest growing software companies. That was an except from a blog post about the founder of constellation softwarewhich is mark leonard. Id just spent the last several days reading every single one of his shareholder letters, and so that is what i'm goin to talk to about to day. And so mark's interesting for a number of reasons. ([Time 0:01:14](https://share.snipd.com/snip/eaf2ab4b-9f37-4076-b6af-2cf17e58872a))
    - **Note:** Turned 25mm into 40bn in 20 years. Very reclusive and independent bought 2-4mm software companies and added operational expertise and compounded over time. Serial acquirer
- The Reclusive Genius Behind a Company: Mark Leonard
  Key takeaways:
  - Mark Leonard started the company at 39 and is still working on it at 66.
  - Leonard is a recluse with only one available photograph online.
  - Access to information on Leonard is limited to shareholder letters and investor calls.
  - Leonard's numbers speak for themselves.
  - The speaker learned about Leonard through a friend's newsletter, Liberty RPF.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Based on my math, mark was 39 when he started the company, and he's still working on the company, and he's 66 years old to day. What who makes him interesting is that he's a recluse. There's only one photograph that you can find on line of what he looks like. He actually looks strikingly similar to rick reuben. And so outside of the occasional underground podcast that you might be able to download, unlike the dark web, the only way to get information about him is to read his shareholdof letters or listen to his investor calls. And i just love the idea of thi super smart genius who's just like, i don't need to speak. My numbers speak for themselves. And so the way i actually learned about mark leonard is actualy through my friend liberty. My friend liberty runs one of the only news letters it actually read. I read like two news letters, his is one of them. I'll leave a link down below, but yo can go to liberty r p f dot com and you can check it out. And it was through reading his news letter for many years, because liberty's been studying mark for almost a decade. And so he was the one thot helpd me organize all the research and all the information that i used as the basis for the podcast. And so before jumping into some high lights from his sherfordal letters, i want to pull out this quote that i heard mark say on this podcast that's not publicly available. And so mark was asked the question like, why is decentralization, autonomy and control so important a constellations? And so mark's answer to this question, you clearly see, ok, this guys a misfit. He's going to far right in on founder. ([Time 0:02:47](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d6f1cb65-03e1-4e68-94f2-e44276caead9))
    - **Note:** Building a decentralized autonomous system where people get to do more or less what they want. Wanted autonomy and control hated being told what to do. Did what he wanted not necessarily accepted by others. Software has network effects and economies of scale. Takes things that are big
- Growing a business through acquisition and efficiency: Insights from a shareholder letter
  Key takeaways:
  - The speaker values the ability to choose what they think is right
  - Jeff Bezos believes the software business has significant economies of scale
  - Amazon has made money by selling additional products to their existing customers
  - Amazon also makes money by making acquired businesses more efficient
  - These strategies are similar to the concept of 'production by reduction' as described by Rick Rubin
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I was struck by principles meaning when he grew up. I guess he meant like they lerly hit him. I challenged teachers. I left home early. I had a boot leg radio license. I built a flame thrower. I did things that were not accepted by lots of other people. The abili to choose what i think is right is something i prize highly oas only jumped into his first shareholder letter, and he says, the software business has significant economies of scale. He says, history suggests that we generally grow our acquired businesses frequently providing addition by frequently providing additional products for them to sell into their install base. So we've made money by selling existing customers more products. And then another way he talks about how they make money is, occasionally, however, the reduction of an acquired business. So a business we bought to a profitable core will leave us with a smaller, but usually more profitable business. So the way i interpret that, we also make money by making companies more efficient. So it this is really made me think of what rick reuben said. He's like, it's production by reduction. I enhance things by removing everything that's not its essence. And so in his sharehold of letters, and everything that i've found on line about mark leonard talks about, hey, let's take something that's big, and let's break it down into more manageable pieces. It's very similar. There's a, i read this this interview with henry singleton, one of the very few ones that he did, and forbes in the 19 seventies. ([Time 0:04:44](https://share.snipd.com/snip/581bbd72-b912-4633-a711-bae08da71c67))
    - **Note:** But good businesses and hold forever. Like network effects of software and cost cutting and synergies.
- Warren Buffett's Strategy for Purchasing Minority Positions in Software Businesses
  Key takeaways:
  - Warren Buffett prefers to own the whole business, but will invest in attractive pieces in public markets
  - When purchasing a piece of a business, the objective is still to be a great, perpetual owner of an attractive asset
  - Buffett is receptive to new information and willing to change his mind, as seen in his strategy shift towards debt during the 2008 financial crisis
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  However, we have also participated in the purchase of a significant minority position in public software businesss. Exactly what warren says is like. By preference, i want to own the home business. Sometimes i realize, hay, pieces of business can be purchased attractively in public markets, so i will do that as well. So that mark describes why he why the strategy is effective and what he's trying to do here. We have same objective when we buy a piece of a business as when we buy a hundred %. We want to be a great, perpetual owner of an inherently attractive asset. It's very obvious, if he reads ho sharehold of letters, that he's receptive to new information. He's going to change his mind. And so we're in two thousand eight sharehold a letter, obviously was a gigantic financial crisis that was occurring at this time. And he's goin to say something here that's really interstig cause he changes strategies in the future as well. So before they avoided debt, and now he's like, wall the market is depressed assets, the assets are going selling for a lot less than we think the value is. Maybe i should take on debt just so i can buy those assets. Until recently, we have avoided using significant amounts of debt. Circumstances, however, may dictate a change in our capital structure. The economy is slow. Credit and equity markets are in rough shape. And buyers for vertical markets, software, hich is what we're trying to be. But buyers for vertical markets offor businesses, are increasingly scarce. So now my com later on he's can talk about it, is getting a lot more difficult, because people are realizing that the idea that we have, an idea that other some other conglomerates have, that v m s businesses are extremely attractive. ([Time 0:07:34](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0c0a35ef-e5b1-4b0e-b282-ff1ee3df8875))
- Warren Buffett's change in strategy in the 2008 financial crisis
  Summary:
  During the 2008 financial crisis, Warren Buffett shifted his strategy to consider taking on debt to acquire undervalued assets.
  The economic slowdown and distressed markets led him to adapt his capital structure. With competition reduced and attractive business acquisitions available at low prices, he saw an opportunity to use financial leverage.
  This strategy shift was a stark contrast to the previous challenge of finding enough attractive acquisitions to utilize operating cash flow.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Are, we will almost certainly be increasing constellations financial leverage. And he knows why this is an opportunity because it's almost a reverse of the problem he had before. For most of the last decade, we struggled to find enough attractive acquisitions to consumer operating cash flow. We believe that the situation has now reversed. And we are sorely tempted to buy as many attractive vertical market software businesses as and while we can. And that's why I would say, hey, I'm against debt, but I need maybe I should reverse that because now I have an opportunity of a lifetime. And to know I left myself here to my interpretation of it as I read this, we avoided debt, but prices are too good and we will borrow money so we can buy what we feel are under price assets. Everyone else is scared. The time to act is now. And when I got to this section, one of my favorite, this paragraph that I read probably three years ago, it's from the Fish that ate the whale. It's Founders Number 37, one of the best books that you could ever read. And there's a paragraph in that book that I've never forgotten. And it describes a point in the career of Sam Zemuri, which is the entrepreneur and the founder that the book is about. And I really feel it's describing what is taking place during this time in history, but also specifically to Constellations business. And so I'm going to read this entire paragraph to you from the Fish that ate the whale. And it says, there are times when certain cards sit unclaimed in the common pile. When certain properties become available, that will never be available again. A good businessman feels these moments like a fall in the barometric pressure. A great businessman ([Time 0:08:09](https://share.snipd.com/snip/72bfad2e-49e0-4fd7-b58f-528073c983d5))
    - **Note:** Mark never took on debt but in 2008 things were so attractive and the opportunity was so good he had to be flexible in order to be more active.
- The Temptation to Buy: Struggling to Find Acquisitions to Having an Opportunity of a Lifetime
  Key takeaways:
  - The speaker previously struggled to find attractive acquisitions to consume operating cash flow
  - The situation has reversed and now the speaker is tempted to buy as many vertical markets as possible
  - The speaker believes the prices for assets are underpriced and will borrow money to purchase them
  - The speaker feels the time to act is now
  - The speaker references a memorable paragraph from the book "The Fish That Ate the Whale" about the founder Samson Murray
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  For most of the last decade, we struggle to find enough attract e acquisitions to consume our operating cash flow. We believe that the situation has now reversed, and we are sorely tempted to buy as many attractive vertical markets to offer businesses as and while we can. And that's why i say i'm against debt. Buti maybe i should reverse that, because now i have an opportunity of a lifetime in the not i left myself here. My interpretation as i read this, we avoided debt, but prices are too good, and we will borrow oney so we can buy what we feel or underprice assets. Everyone else is scared. The time to act is now. And when i got to this section, one of my favoriteis this paragraph that i read probably three years ago. It's from the fish that ate the whaleto foundersn 37, one of the best books that you could ever read. And there's a paragraph in that book that i have never forgotten. And it describes a a point in the career of samson murray, which thunce printer and the founder that the book is about. And i really feel describing what is taking place during this time and history, but also specifically to constollations business an so i'm going to read this entire paragraph to you from the fish that ate the whale. And it says, there are times when certain cards sit unclaimed in the common pile. When certain properties become available that will never be available again. A good business man feels these moments like a fall in the barometric pressure. A great business man is dumb enough to act on them, even when he cannot afford to. ([Time 0:09:31](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a2df8e4a-b924-46b5-98fe-2f8f6ff28b0d))
    - **Note:** Sam zemurray at times great properties are available at great prices and a great businessman is foolish enough to do what it takes to buy them.
- Maximizing Long-Term Returns for Software Businesses
  Key takeaways:
  - Both the founder and private equity approaches can be improved for long term returns
  - Mark's strategy involves growing revenues without incremental capital and using cash flow to buy more businesses for long term compounding
  - Software businesses are preferred for their low attrition rates
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  We try to find an optimum position where incremental investment still generates good, incremental, long term, long term returns. We think bot approaches can be improved, meaning the approach of both the founder and the private equity. So really the note, i mself hre er in my interpretation of what he's saying here, founders think that the future will be better if we are bigger, private equity wants to squeeze every last dollar out now. And then once we get to the two thousand nine sharehold letter, this is where i wrote, this is the very first time i start to understand what mark is doing and what he's actually shooting for. And so he's talking about the fits of having all thes software businesses. And he's sang, in our businesses, we can nearly always grow revenues organically without incremental capital. And because he's getting up more revenue and more profit without investing an having the vest more money, takes those cash fellows buys more businesses, and that's how you abl to compound for a long period of time. And but this is why he chose v m s businesses, because they typically have really low attrition rates. So he says, our attrition rates also illustrate the long term nature of our climet relationships. Attrition due to the loss of customers in two thousand nine was four %. This suggests that our average anmr, that our average customer will stay with constellation for 26 years. Customer relationships that endure for more than two decades are valuable. We have symbtic relationships with tens of thousands of customers. ([Time 0:12:19](https://share.snipd.com/snip/02c34a1a-76a9-47dc-9e49-e5ce22ecfe86))
    - **Note:** Software is good because low churn great customer and supply dynamics. Saw pe companies were focused on extraction and founders wanted growth at all costs. Mark wanted to balance the two. Very long term thinking and let’s the managers run their own business. Gives their best practices and is otherwise hands off.
- The Pitfalls of Constantly Launching New Products for Softwood Companies
  Key takeaways:
  - Softwood companies require regular launching of new products by developers and founders
  - Initiatives grew to account for over half of combined expenditures in 2005
  - Efficiency with money is necessary for scaling
  - Adding similar companies can lead to loss of control
  - Understanding human nature improves financial performance
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  We need to add new features, new softwood like new parts of our software. We need to go into new markets, which out without actually knowing if that's oing to work or not. And he says, the ethos of softwoard companies requires the regular launching of visionary new products by steely eyed, tenacious developers, product managers or founders initiative. So this constant outgrowth of of humans constantly wanting to do more. Whether that doing moreis actually beneficial or not, its uncertain certain right? In initiatives grew to account for over half of our combined expenditures by two thousand five which, not coincidentally, was the peake of our spending. So he's bringing this up because it's like, we are not going tob able to scale if we're not efficient with our money. Adas, we added more and more companies. They all happened to do very similar things. This got out of control. So we now wes can explain how we's going to n how we went up solving this problem. Remember, it is about improving the financial performance of your company by understanding human nature and its likely pitfalls. Even the best initiatives take more time and more investment than anticipated. As the data came in, two things happened at the business level, we started doing a better job of manage initiatives, and this spending, soe research, development, sales and marketing spending decreased. So the first thing they did is tha they had to develop a system. ([Time 0:21:43](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2816e607-cf01-41f2-81fd-5d69f27c9751))
    - **Note:** They do longer term initiatives and then maintenance capex. Put one person in charge for ownership and remained mentally flexible to change paths if he thought it was right. Used data and measured what they wanted then made adjustments to their plan. When they started making people responsible for initiatives the amount of new ones went down so they realized they were just waisting money. Always looked for a crisis to add risk.
- Ways of Achieving Scale and Learning from History's Greatest Unprinters
  Key takeaways:
  - The speaker does not support creating larger businesses to solve quotum complexity problems.
  - Listening to the podcast gives access to 254 full-length episodes, with more added every week.
  - The main benefit of listening to the podcast is to learn from history's greatest unprinters and use their ideas in your work.
  - Many successful people, such as Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Rockefeller, Carnegie, and Warren Buffet, read biographies and studied the great people that came before them.
  - Reading biographies allows individuals to learn from the best ideas and avoid the worst mistakes of past successful people.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I am not a proponent of handling our quotum complexity problem by creating a bunch of 400 employee businesses to replace our forty employee businesses. I'm looking for ways of achieving scale elsewhere. Thanks for making it to the end of this preview. If you want to finish listening to this episode, you'll need to upgrade. Once you do that, you'll get immediate access to 254 foll length episodes. And i add more episodes every week. The main benefit of listening to founders is to have the ability to learn from history's greatest un printers quickly, so then you can use their ideas in your work. All of history's crazeson printers did this. They read biographies. They studied the great people that came before them. People like steve jobbs talks about doing this. Elon moss, jeff bayses, rockefell er, carnegie, warren buffet. They all talk about doing this. Some of the smartest, most productive people to ever live spent their very valuable time reading biographies and learning from the great people that came before them so that they could use their best ideas in their work and avoid their worst mistakes. I had no idea how important this activity was before i started fof ounder spotcast. Ten years ago, i was watching an interview with elan musk, and he was asked the question, how did you learn how to start a company? He started his first company when he was till in his twenties. Didn't have resources, didn't have a network. And so a question, so you must have read a lot of business books. And his answer gave me the idea to do founders prodcasts many years later. And he said, no, i didn't read business books. I read biographies and autoobiographies. ([Time 0:30:01](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9f6fae43-8fee-420c-8e4e-30c1383435fe))
    - **Note:** He is not worried about complexity to lead to more centralization he valued the decentralized nature and didn’t see any need to add managers for the sake of it. He also uses bank debt because he needed to but he didn’t like the duration mismatch in assets forever and liabilities short term.
- He always traveled economy and didn’t want to waste money on the shareholders dime. He reached and age when he wanted to slow down so he stopped taking a salary and said he’d work less. Built his organization to last. Test and experiment then roll the successful experiments out broadly. Paul orphelia of kinkos would travel around and figure out the best innovations at each business unit then spread it around he didn’t mandate anything because then people wouldn’t experiment. Freedom to make mistakes with guiding hand. He realized management can subtract so he was careful to be strictly accretive. Don’t share sales r+d ect. When a business gets to big carve out some and spin it out. When you get big you lose entrepreneurship. Science is organized skepticism too much of business is disorganized optimism. You can’t be normal and expect abnormal results. ([Time 0:32:27](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b63ef86d-9d4b-4da7-8f7d-a5b7be733088))

    - **Note:** Mark was first cost conscious and saw his organization as a decentralized emergent system running different and varied experiments. Try small experiments and kill/scale up what works. Freedom to make mistakes and addition by subtraction you need to bring the critical approach into your business.
      Remaimed decentralized allowed for emergence Keep the entrepreneurial and high agency culture.
      Science is organized skepticism too much of business is disorganized optimism. You can’t be normal and expect abnormal results.

- Believed in small groups of smart people not economies of scale and continuously built his business that way. ([Time 0:32:27](https://share.snipd.com/snip/18b99208-51d9-4b68-a264-7426310cb301))

    - **Note:** He studied similar businesses and figured out areas where they succeeded and failed. Deep historical knowledge and learning from the best of others he realized that in the structure they had they needed a high trust culture.
- Understand the power of network effects and economies of scale but they want to play the decentralized small company game. Gives autonomy and plays their own game. Few rules a lot of trust and teams work together with each other. The bigger you get the complexity increases exponentially and the smart quirky people get weeded out. Big managers lack the courage and reflection to understand when the job has gotten too complex. ([Time 0:32:27](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6a12ffe9-864b-4351-8dc8-4608185b7d4e))
