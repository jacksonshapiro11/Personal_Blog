- Document Note: UU situations makes the classically trained uncomfortable.  Clasicaly trained invests struggle in UU worsts and UU is widespread and inevitable.  UU drives power law returns you need to accept losses to own wins.  If ou like to advert blame UU investing isn't for you.  If you aren't looking stupid you're not investing right.  UU events arrive with a thunderclap with no time to prepare like a terrorist attack it just happens and the world is instantly changed.  The stock market doubling then selling off isnt a UU.  Alot of UU events are unique to your skills and abilities and others cannot monetize them.  asymetric info is vital in investing.  Unique situations are vital for UU investing or UUU.  Fat tails are features of UU investments it's not normal distribution but fat tailed distribution.  UUU investments require timing as well when is it time to be risk on or risk off.  UU investments require a complementary skill set and a pair of balls to take the risk to invest.  Buffet knows companies better than the average federer knows tennis you need to play your game.  They can educate the avg. person because their skillset is so much better.

- Summary: Investing in the Unknown and Unknowable is an essay that discusses the principles employed by wise investors who have earned extraordinary returns by investing in unknown and unknowable (UU) situations. The essay explains how to identify good investments in situations where the level of uncertainty is well beyond that considered in traditional models of finance. The essay deploys central concepts in decision analysis, game theory, and behavioral decision alongside real investment decisions to unearth successful investment strategies. The essay concludes by stating that learning to invest more wisely in a UU world may be the most promising way to significantly bolster one's prosperity.

### Highlights

- the wisest investors have earned extraordinary returns by investing in the unknown and the unknow- able (UU). But they have done so on a reasoned, sensible basis. This essay explains some of the central principles that such investors employ. It starts by discussing “ignorance,” a widespread situation in the real world of investing, where even the possible states of the world are not known. Traditional finance theory does not apply in UU situations.
  Strategic thinking, deducing what other investors might know or not, and assessing whether they might be deterred from investing, for example due to fiduciary requirements, frequently point the way to profitability. Most big investment payouts come when money is combined with comple- mentary skills, such as knowing how to develop real estate or new technologies. Those who lack these skills can look for ”sidecar” investments that allow them to put their money alongside that of people they know to be both capable and honest. The reader is asked to consider a number of such investments.
  Central concepts in decision analysis, game theory, and behavioral decision are deployed along- side real investment decisions to unearth successful investment strategies. These strategies are distilled into eight investment maxims. Learning to invest more wisely in a UU world may be the most promising way to significantly bolster your prosperity ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr3979qe6ea01k4adyy4nrnf))
    - **Note:** investing in unknown and unknowble things is taking risk others wont so you have an edge if you do it sensibly and it's complementary to your skills
- Do not read on, however, if blame aversion is a prime concern: The world of UU is not for you. Consider this analogy. If in an unknowable world none of your bridges fall down, you are building them too strong. Similarly, if in an unknowable world none of your investment looks foolish after the fact, you are staying too far away from the unknowable.
  Warren Buffett, a master at investing in the unknowable, and therefore a featured player in this essay, is fond of saying that playing contract bridge is the best training for business. Bridge requires a continual effort to assess probabilities in at best marginally knowable situations, and players need to make hundreds of decisions in a single session, often balancing expected gains and losses. But players must also continually make peace with good decisions that lead to bad outcomes, both one’s own decisions and those of a partner. Just this peacemaking skill is required if one is to invest wisely in an unknowable world.
  The nature of unknowable events. Many of the events that we classify as unknowable arrive in an unanticipated thunderclap, giving us little or no time to anticipate or prepare. But once they happen, they do not appear that strange. The human mind has an incredible ability to find a rationalization for why it should have been able to conjecture the terror attack of 9/11; or the Asian tsunamis of 1997 and 2005, respectively caused by currency collapse and underwater earthquake. This propensity to incorporate hindsight into our memories – and to do so particularly when Monday morning quarterbacks may attack us – hinders ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr39ysyeq3qe1v5k7p4k0y5y))
    - **Note:** UU events need to take agency
- Maxim A: Individuals with complementary skills enjoy great positive excess returns from UU investments. Make a sidecar investment alongside them when given the opportunity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr3b3mvrem7sd248h5eethhx))

    - **Note:** what questions do you need to ask for a UU investment or line of thinking should you go down through deduction. Domain expertise yields and edge
- Virtually all of us fall into important decision traps when dealing with the unknowable. This section discusses two, overconfidence and recollection bias, and then gives major attention to a third, misweighting differences in probabilities and payoffs. But there are dozens of decision traps, and some will appear later in this essay. The Nobel Prize winning work of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky (the latter was warmly cited, but died too soon to win), 11 and the delightful and insightful *Poor Charlie’s Almanack*, written by Charles Munger (Warren Buffett’s partner) respectively provide academic and finance-oriented discussions of such traps.
  There are at least three major objections to behavioral economics: First, in competitive markets, the anomalies it describes will be arbitraged away. Second, the anomalies only appear in carefully crafted situations; they are much like optical illusions, intriguing but rarely affecting everyday vision. Third, they describe the way people do behave, but not the way they should behave. The first ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr3brrnat6rcsc54dsn6f5n2))
    - **Note:** we need to mitigate overconfidence in our investments and respect uncertainty. We need to know we don't know not think we know. hindsight bias is a big issue. We shold review our successes and failures objectively even though we will like MMQB it and make it all seem clearer than it was. We need to carefully calibrate payoffs and probabilities and misweighting these is clear failure. Humans have trouble with low probability events like finding the difference between 1% and 2.5% and we struggle to tolerate ambiguity people avoid ambiguity and hate it. the more ambigious the better the investmnet because the more people are driven away
- This hypothetical experiment establishes a baseline for another one that involves UU events. This time the prizes are based on events that are as close to the spectrum of UU events as possible, subject to the limitation that they must be named.16 Thus, a contingency might be that a 10,000-ton asteroid passed within 50,000 miles of Earth within the past decade, or that more than a million mammals crossed the border from Tanzania to Kenya last year. To begin our experiment, we ask a random sample of people to guess the likelihood of these contingencies. We then alter the asteroid distance or the number of animals in the question until the median answer is 0.03. Thus, if 50,000 miles got a median answer of 0.05, we would adjust to 40,000 miles, etc.
  We now ask a new group of individuals to choose between C and D, assuming that we have calibrated the asteroid and mammal question to get to 0.03.
  Lottery Choice: Payoffs Versus Probability or UU Event
  Payoff
  Required contingency
  C
  $2000
  Draw a 17 from an urn with balls numbered 1 to 100
  D
  $1000
  10,000-ton asteroid passed within 40,000 miles of Earth
  Lotteries C and D should yield their prizes with estimated probabilities of 1% and 3% respectively. Still, we suspect that many more people would pick C over D than picked A over B, and that this would be true for the animal movement contingency as well.17
  A more elaborated version of this problem would offer prizes based on alternative UU contingencies coming to pass. For example, we might recalibrate the mammal-crossing problem to get a median response of 0.01. We would then have:
  16 This illustration employs events that may have happened in the past, but subjects would not know. The purpose is to make payoffs immediate, since future payoffs suffer from a different form of bias.
  17 The experiment is at a disadvantage in getting this result, since peoples’ assessments of the
  contingencies’ probabilities would vary widely. Some would pick D because they attached an unusually high probability to it. In theory, one could ask people their probability estimate after they made their choice, and then look only at the answers of those for whom the probability was in a narrow range. However, individuals would no doubt adjust their retrospective probability estimates to help rationalize their choice.
  Lottery Choice: Payoffs Versus UU Events
  Payoff
  Required contingency
  E
  $2000
  Calibrated large number of animals crossed the Tanzania- Kenya border
  F
  $1000
  10,000 ton-asteroid passed within 40,000 miles of Earth
  Here the values have been scaled so the median response is three times higher for the asteroid event than the animal crossing. We would conjecture again that E would be chosen frequently.18 People do not like to rely on the occurrence of UU events, and choices based on distinguishing among their probabilities would be an unnatural act.
  Daniel Ellsberg (1961) alerted us to ambiguity aversion long before he created a UU event by publishing the Pentagon papers. In an actual experiment, he showed, in effect, that individuals preferred to win a prize if a standard coin flip came up heads, rather than to win that prize by choosing either heads or tails on the flip of a mangled coin whose outcome was difficult to predict.19 Such ambiguity aversion may be a plausible heuristic response to general decisions under uncertainty, since so often there is a better-informed person on the other side – such as someone selling a difficult-to-assess asset.20 Whatever the explanation, ambiguity aversion has the potential to exert a powerful effect. Extending Ellsberg one step further, it would seem that the more ambiguous the contingencies, the greater the aversion. If so, UU investments will drive away all but the most self-directed and rational thinking investors. Thus, Speculation 1 is reinforced.

    - **Note:** Bet more where you have an edge
- Maxim C: When information asymmetries may lead your counterpart to be concerned about trading with you, identify for her important areas where you have an absolute advantage from trading. You can also identify her absolute advantages, but she is more likely to know those already. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr3kzh9aykpqwtmqc2gb96pk))
    - **Note:** identify your edges and the person you're trading withs edge. We overweight the information we have and underrate the information someone else has because were biased towards ourselves but we need to put ourselves in their shoes and investigate why they believe what they believe and likely when we both asses the probabilities we will come nearer to each other relative to the weight of information gain and that weighting shouldn't be biased toward what we believe even though it is in practice
- Maxim D: In a situation where probabilities may be hard for either side to assess, it may be sufficient to assess your knowledge relative to the party on the other side (perhaps the market). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr3mpyt356awptrbffar1ew7))

- Speculation 3. UU situations offer great investment potential given the combination of information asymmetries and lack of competition.
  Boxes E and F are also the situations where other players will be attempting to take advantage of us and, if it is our inclination, we might take advantage of them. This is the area where big money changes hands.
  A key problem is to determine when you might be played for a sucker. Sometimes this is easy. Anyone who has small oil interests will have received many letters offering to buy, no doubt coming from people offering far less than fair value. They are monopsonists after all, and appropriately make offers well below the market. They may not even have any inside knowledge. But they are surely taking advantage of the impulsive or impatient among us, or those who do not understand the concepts in this paper.
  Being a possible sucker may be an advantage if you can gauge the probability. People are strongly averse to being betrayed. They demand much stronger odds when a betraying human rather than an indifferent nature would be the cause of a loss (Bohnet and Zeckhauser, 2004).

    - **Note:** E is known states of the world to others but unknown to you and F is unkown states of the world to you and others and unknown probabilities
- Maxim E: A significant absolute advantage offers some protection against potential selection. You should invest in a UU world if your advantage multiple is great, unless the probability is high the other side is informed and if, in addition, the expected selection factor is severe.

    - **Note:** sometimes UU is good when you have an edge don't be the sucker but bearing extra risk is important. Bet big when you have an edge but make sure you have that edge.
- Maxim F: In UU situations, even sophisticated investors tend to underweight how strongly the value of assets varies. The goal should be to get good payoffs when the value of assets is high.
  No doubt Ricardo also took Maxim F into account when he purchased the “Waterloo bonds.” He knew that English money would be far more valuable if Wellington was victorious and his bonds soared in value, than if he lost and the bonds plummeted.

    - **Note:** in UU situations prices can vary greatly. Things can move more extremely than you expect when they do.
- It is also instructive to consider Buffett’s approach to assessing the probabilities in this UU situation, as revealed in the same annual report:
  So what are the true odds of our having to make a payout during the policy's term? We don't know - nor do we think computer models will help us, since we believe the precision they project is a chimera. In fact, such models can lull decision-makers into a false sense of security and thereby increase their chances of making a really huge mistake. We've already seen such debacles in both insurance and investments. Witness "portfolio insurance," whose destructive effects in the 1987 market crash led one wag to observe that it was the computers that should have been jumping out of windows.
  Buffett was basically saying to Wall Street firms: “Even if you hire 100 brilliant Ph.D.s to run your models, no sensible estimate will emerge.” These are precisely the types of UU situations where the competition will be thin, the odds likely favorable, and the Buffetts of this world can thrive.

    - **Note:** we value what we can quantify and overtrust models when we could just be approximately right and that would be great
- Maxim G: Discounting for ambiguity is a natural tendency that should be overcome, just as should be overeating.
  Maxim H: Do not engage in the heuristic reasoning that just because you do not know the risk, others do. Think carefully, and assess whether they are likely to know more than you. When the odds are extremely favorable, sometimes it pays to gamble on the unknown, even though there is some chance that people on the other side may know more than you.

    - **Note:** Sometimes it pays to bet on uncertain futures because if no one knows the future and everyone is scared there is less competition. Need to be careful if this is a known unknown to you or everyone.
