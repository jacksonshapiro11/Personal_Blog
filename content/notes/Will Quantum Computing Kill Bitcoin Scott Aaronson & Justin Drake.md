### Highlights

- **Quantum Computing: From Research to Engineering**
  - Quantum computing is transitioning from theoretical research to an engineering challenge.
  - A key concept is the difference between physical qubits (noisy building blocks) and logical qubits (created through error correction).
  - The Willow breakthrough demonstrated the creation of a logical qubit from many physical ones.
  - Breaking cryptography requires thousands or more logical qubits combined into a fault-tolerant quantum computer. 
  - This shift means scaling and engineering are now the main hurdles, not the fundamental science.

  Yeah, so one basic concept is that there's two types of qubits. There's the physical qubits and the logical qubits. If we want to do rewards are there. Computation that breaks cryptography, we need these more fancy logical qubits. But the building blocks, the bricks that make up the logical qubits are what's called physical qubits. And unfortunately, the physical qubits are extremely noisy. And so we need what's called error correction. So we need to take the noise, remove it so that we're left with pure signal, which is binary digital signal. And I think the very beginning of our conversation basically was with this willow breakthrough where essentially we have for the first time a logical qubit a logical qubit one of them So we're able to take 101 physical qubits put them in a lattice and basically we have this error correction happen and that gives us this meta building block which is the logical qubit And then if we want to go actually break cryptography, we need to put thousands, tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of these logical qubits together to form what's called A scalable fault tolerant quantum computer.

  Okay, so I'm sort of getting the picture. Of course, you know this, you're an Ethereum researcher, but you know things in ethereum or crypto at large are just like basically research theory type phase and then they become an Engineering challenge it feels like that's kind of what where we're at with quantum computing where we've been in this kind of research theory type phase but now we've hit this threshold Of oh now it's just an engineering and scale problem and like humans are really good at that that's why scott kept going back to like I don't know when it's going to happen.
