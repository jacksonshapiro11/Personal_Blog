  Do I worry about it for other people? I will say that when I was young and a World of Warcraft raid guild leader who spent a thousand hours on that, that it was a substitute advancement ladder for me. The actual job I was working, salary man in central Japan, gave me no scope of control over things. And I thought, if I was a startup CEO, I could make decisions right now. I could build something awesome, but I don't have that ability. And I don't see myself as being the kind of person who could become a startup CEO. So if I can't be satisfied in my nine to five in terms of making things happen in the world, at the very least I can make sure we killed the dragon in two hours. Don't stand in the fire. Come on team leaders. You need to make sure that people are equipped with the resist gear before they get there. Oh, we're having like internal spats about allocation of resources. Like we need to have a better DKP system. By the way, World of Warcraft raid guilds and all other places where intellectual effort comes together in the video game community are much more sophisticated than people give them Credit for. When I started Vaccinate CA, I told people my sole prior leadership experience is having 60 direct reports in a raid guild and that's true. And also like we don't rat hole on the subject but like there are parts of vaccinate CA that are very, very definitely downstream of the like intellectual efforts about managing a raid Guild specifically. There were multiple people internally who were like, yep, like we are running the raid guild playbook right now. But be that as it may. You can do something with your life. Choose to do something with your life. And then if you want to play a reasonable amount of video games, then play a reasonable amount of video games. And then with respect to individual people, I sometimes worry that you kind of get into, think, I've struggled with depression at some points in my life. Many people struggle with underdiagnosed, under treated depression. I think sometimes you get into a self-destructed spiral measured against your true values and similar values and preferences where due to depression and other factors, you aren't Making as much progress on the true goals you do. You use video games as an escape from that, and not just video games, books, television, etc., etc. There are many poisons available in life. You pick your poison, use that to escape. The amount of effort you put into the poison causes you to have less effort available to do the thing. So you get less good results than the thing. So helping people out of those self-destructive spirals is something that we as a society could stand to get much better at.
