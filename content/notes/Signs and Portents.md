- Summary: As AI development is happening much faster than previously expected, it is difficult to predict the future accurately. However, there are already signs of the impact AI is having on work, including boosting overall performance, acting as a leveler, and being better at some tasks than others. Despite the potential for disruption, people who use AI for work tend to be happier with their jobs, as they can outsource the boring work to the AI. Additionally, AI is being experimented with in education, with potentially positive outcomes for teaching and mentoring. There is still much to learn about AI, but GPT-4 has shown a lot of potential for a variety of real-world tasks.

### Highlights

- **1) AI boosts overall performance at complex work tasks.** In [the large-scale controlled trial that my colleagues and I conducted at Boston Consulting Group](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/centaurs-and-cyborgs-on-the-jagged) we found consultants using the same version of GPT-4 everyone in the world has access to 12.2% more tasks on average, completed tasks 25.1% more quickly, and produced 40% higher quality results than those without the tool.

    - **Note:** AI is boosting work by 40%. AI is currently helping lower performers more. AI is good at things that humans find hard and bad at things they find easy sometimes
- I know this because anxiety in the C-suite is unevenly distributed, and there are already exceptions to the general AI complacency. For example, Eric Vaughan, the CEO of software company IgniteTech, saw the implications of AI quickly and made its use mandatory throughout the company this summer. He gave all employees access to a ChatGPT Plus subscription and some training, with the expectation that everyone in the company would engage in experimentation. Eric was extremely serious about the need to transform that company - he fired everyone who did not at least try to use AI by the end of the month, and gave cash prizes to people who came up with good prompts to improve their work - a much more dramatic embrace of AI than I have seen elsewhere. But other companies are considering transformation as well. Another organization I spoke to altered their hiring policy. Before a new hire is approved, the team has to spend a couple hours trying to automate the potential job as using AI. They can only post new openings after they see how much AI can supplement or replace the need for a new employee.
  The experiences of these early adopters suggest that productivity improvements could significantly alter the nature of jobs. And, indeed, there are some troubling signs about the potential job market impact of AI on freelance workers. [A new study of a major freelancing platform](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4602944) found that posting for jobs that could be done with AI declined 21% after ChatGPT was introduced, and a 17% drop in graphic design jobs after image-creating AIs were released. We are likely to see similar effects ripple through the economy, [though a survey of economists still sees net job growth as a result of AI](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/impact-artificial-intelligence-growth-and-employment), there will certainly be many changes to individual jobs that policy makers need to consider.

    - **Note:** AI is already automating jobs away at a high rate and needs to be considered closely for every hire and role
- Moving beyond the classroom, we also have our first findings on the real-world impact of AI mentoring. A [fascinating new paper reports on a six-month long experiment using GPT-4 to provide advice to small business entrepreneurs in Kenya](https://osf.io/preprints/osf/hdjpk). They found that getting AI mentoring boosted the performance of the best entrepreneurs by 20% - a very large effect for an educational intervention. Interestingly, low performers actually did worse after getting AI mentoring help because they tended to ask questions that the AI was not good at answering or got advice they could not take (many of the low performers had businesses that were already in trouble). To me, this suggests that AI instruction can have real-world impacts, but we need to carefully design these tools to work for students of all ability levels.
