  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  There's several other a canadian, a real sea developers, igt, that he gets involved with in the book. And there they're talked about the book about youno being much smarter, d more wealthy than him, than him. When this book ends, they're not bankrupt. I went and looked up and see if i could find books in these guys. Turns out they all go bankrupt too.
  Speaker 1
  But the reason i wanted to circle back around that, to that thought, is because really it's a fantasy, because this guy was easily distracted. And as this next section im gong to read to you, wou were going to see a bunch of these anti patterns these these traits that he had that we just want to do the opposite of. And says, a mean to skip over the person's name, caes, not important. But he was also aware of bob's wild card reputation, his quick temper, his absurd grandiocity, his tendency to off on exotic tangents outside of real state, many of which were pursued Whole, wholeheartedly and then dropped. So he jumps around a lot.
  Speaker 2
  He's not thorough. Ah, he's, there's, there's a differece. Betweni we talk about steve jobs, a reality distortion field, and the idea that markage reson has that the world is a lot more malleable than you think, and if you focus all your efforts, That you can change the world around you. That's not bob's version of grandiosity. This guyde lives in a fantasy land that has no tach attachment to any form of reality by any means, but just his absurd grandiosity. ([Time 0:06:45](https://share.snipd.com/snip/88d2c1f0-cd75-4e15-9d3e-19566bc4f583))
    - **Note:** Bob is an anti model of how not to run a business he runs it into the ground. He made a ton on Wall Street but then got into real estate and got out of his circle of competence and lost all his money. He was easily distracted wild card reputation veered off in tangents. Jumps around a lot quick temper not thurough. He lives in a fantasy land the world isn’t malleable if you don’t live in an accurate model of it. Here excited quickly then drops it and moves to the next thing never dedicated. He did an lbo of a 2bn company with 200mm of equity. He literally thinks he can do anything but has no focus or ability or drive just expects it to happen for him. No self control or discipline. Gets taken advantage all the time. Sells company buys back higher in 2 years. Everyone loans this guy money.

  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Keen employees, aware of his situation, had begun to gossip, which eventually caused bob to summon them to a special meeting in which he admitted to his double life. At the same time, he made it clear that he'd never tolerate such behaviour on the part of anyone else on the pay roll, who would be fired on the spot for pulling a stunt similar to his. Only an extraordinary person, he said, could stand up to the strain. This guy is bananas that he would say that. But we've seen this before.
  Speaker 2
  Frank loyd wright winds up getting the time he's having a fair i think, in the state he's in, it's like illegal adultery was actually illegal. I think he gets arrested for er, if i remember correctly.
  Speaker 1
  Then he holds a press conference on christmas day, and he actually says, he says, listen, rules are for normal people. I, frank lloyd wright, am not normal.
  Speaker 2
  Essentially, bob just did the same thing with his employers, right? So let's go back to the very beginning ofte first pani transaction. Pain webber knows that he he doesn't have t money to buy allies to tring to get creative pain.
  Speaker 1
  Webber's plan was for bob to buy a sizable trunk of allied stock, then approach the co about co operating in some sort of friendly deal. He study of bob's assets had reinforced the suspicion that a hostile takeover was out of the question, since bob would have to borrow up to two point five billion dollars to buy olive Allied 50 million shares. ([Time 0:18:03](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a1ec41dc-2aa1-4f98-abe2-f4c3a089f950))
    - **Note:** He literally decides one day to do an lbo and finds the bank in the yellow pages the dude has no clue what he’s doing. No plan or intelligence people trust other banks through outsourced thinking that’s how he gets so far. It’s like the ftx diligence relying on others. Has 2 families this is end of bubble behavior. This guy is legit insane. Borrowed 2.5bn on 100mm people just believed him everyone was an idiot he didn’t need the cash just the promise of cash. He bought a company and ran it never even went into the stores he made false promises of money basically just lied. He was irrational he held up a 600k sale over a lawn mower. Future problems have future solutions solve the problem in front of you the figure the rest out.

    - **Note:** He literally has all the banks competing for his shit business everyone in this is a clown. There are people committing tons of crimes to get deals done trying everything reduce mostly included breaking the law. Most people in this acquisition go to jail non tried everything double every loophole. Bad reflection on investment bankers Bob had a Fourtune teller. First Boston literally bets the entire firms capital on a bridge loan to Bob because they would’ve made 100mm in fees they’ve up because of this. Bob led these guys on by forcing them to get deeper and deeper and they were in too deep to pull out he gave empty promises and the bankers bought it. Bob literally hired people without interviewing them for ceo and lived in a fantasy world.

  Remember it. Warren Buffett says 12. Okay, 14, 12. Okay, 12. Words like I don't I don't bid. Like this is I've already worked out what I'm going to pay for it, except it or not. And he winds up getting it for 12. This is the again, Warren, brilliant, intelligent, smart, the people running Crown America, the opposite, right? These are the anti patterns that we see here. This another one was this is now another example of this. I'm going to exclude the company and the people because it doesn't matter. They do this one bid 95 million, the next highest offer, the only other offer turned out to be $60 million, $60 million. And so then there's a there's a footnote in the book later. And I went and put it back on this page, because it would have reminded me says in only a minority of cases, did the allied divisions add to anyone's prosperity, except the bankruptcy Lawyers? And so a lot of these people that are overbidding, if you overbidding by $35 million or something, and who even knows if it's worth 60 million to begin with, what do you think's going to Happen? Another another myself, time is the best filter. There are several people in this book who are described as wealthy. I looked them up after and they all went bankrupt. And a lot of these companies that overbid for these ([Time 0:47:36](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0deed04f-7719-465c-a594-e298f7cbca7e))

    - **Note:** He cultivated desire in the auction process everyone was outsourcing thinking classic bubble behavior. No one was disciplined and they all went bankrupt. He was a great negotiator and never blinked. Finding the right buyer is important and playing up the auction cultivating desire
- The Federated Deal

  His contract. $3 million for six months work. I'm supposed to be I think a million dollars a year or three years, right? So he pays a three million dollars for six months work. Plus an estimated $200,000 more of stock options. I want to go back to this this terrible idea of relying on models. So for the Federated deal to work, the model had one assumption stacked on another stacked on another assumption stacked on another assumption that all had to go exactly as planned. Because there's no room for error here, because that room for error is taken up by a gargantuan amount of fees. Check this out. Such was the Federated deal as it appeared on paper. All would be well, the number crunchers predicted provided, of course, that the divisions on the block sold for the expected high prices that Bob would take out the Federated mortgages, The Federated budget would be kind of think about all these crazy assumptions that have to go exactly precise. This is insane. The divisions on the block would sold would be sold for exactly the high prices they they expected. That Bob would take out the Federated mortgages, or that he could get it. The Federated budget would be cut on schedule, etc, etc. Interesting enough, Citicore, which he put on the financing package together wasn't taking this bet. This is going to remind you of if you ever read the big short 2008-2009 financial crisis, as it worked to syndicate the Federated deal and to form a permanent bank group, Citicore, also Assiduously, I can never pronounce that word, laid ([Time 0:57:40](https://share.snipd.com/snip/479033d6-89bb-4828-9bc9-9570feba78a5))
