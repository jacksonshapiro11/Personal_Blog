### Highlights

- Episode AI notes
  1. In relationships, it is important to communicate and make requests. Setting boundaries can help in maintaining a strong relationship. Sometimes it is necessary to express dissatisfaction and reiterate previous discussions for better understanding.
  2. Confidence is self-trust, not just feeling good about yourself. Confidence is about being okay with not being the best at something and trusting yourself in those moments. Confidence and resilience are related concepts. Building confidence requires a clear understanding of the trait. Actionable strategies may not always be effective in building confidence.
  3. Prioritizing connection with your kid is important in effective communication. Forming a connection with your kid before addressing issues is crucial. Reconnecting with your kid helps to de-shame and unfreeze them. Connecting first is an effective principle in communicating with kids. The way we think about someone influences how we communicate with them.
  4. Voices of self-doubt and negativity are inevitable, but it's important to keep them in check and not let them control our actions. Regulating emotions is crucial for both children and adults, and parents play a significant role in teaching their kids how to do so. Curiosity about oneself is a key factor in improving emotional regulation and responding to triggers in a more grounded and composed manner.
  5. Acknowledging and validating emotions can help regulate and control emotional reactions. Using feeling words can aid in acknowledging and validating emotions. Giving oneself permission to feel and cope with emotions is important. AVP (acknowledge, validate, permit) can be practiced by setting reminders and checking in with emotions. Practicing AVP regularly can lead to improved emotional regulation and coping skills.
  6. Repair is one of the most powerful relationship strategies. You can't repair if you don't mess up. The first step to repair is admitting that you messed up. Repair is important, especially for kids. Concrete ways to repair after yelling at a child.
  7. Most fights between partners are fueled by a desire for the other person to be more like oneself. Differences between partners are often what attracted them initially but can later repel them. When a partner expresses their feelings, they are not necessarily blaming the other person or claiming to be in the right. Sharing feelings can be an opportunity to learn more about one's partner.

  Great, that's great. Okay. So let's say, you know, I tend to be tired at the end of a week and I want to go to bed early. And my partner's like, but I really like to have dinner together and I want to have time together. But I'm so frustrated because I'm like, my husband comes home at like nine o'clock and expects me to like cook dinner then with him. And all of a sudden it's 10 and I'm exhausted and I want to connect to, right? But here's the situation. So I think what we might do is we might say, I really needed to be home by seven. Like can you get home on seven on a Friday? And then that's a place where we could cook dinner together. And then let's say my husband rolls in at nine and I'm like, what the heck? Like I told him to have dinner at seven and like he didn't do it. And he never listens to me. He doesn't respect me. And we tell ourselves all these stories. To me, I would say in that situation, I was making a request of my husband. I was making a request. And most of the time in our relationships, by the way, we can't always set boundaries. Like we do make requests and hopefully our relationship is strong enough with someone, which we can talk about where they would, you know, when they can honor our request, right? But I'm making a request because the success is dependent on my husband coming home at seven, which he just did not do. Here's a very different approach, which I don't always recommend taking, but sometimes we have to take if we feel like we keep getting in situations where we're kind of really unsatisfied. I'd say, hey, the last couple of weeks, we talked about you getting home at seven or trying to, you keep getting home at nine. ([TimeÂ 0:04:20](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e46b7259-181c-4ef0-a776-3fd2bd23d580))
    - **Note:** Boundaries is laying out what you will do then. Making a request. Assertions of wants and needs in a relationship when weâ€™re frustrated we approach someone in an adversarial way instead of just being honest with your needs and not being a bitch about it. Then sticking to your guns. You can see yourself on the same side of a problem or as adversaries. Obviously one is better. We only do things we donâ€™t want to for others to strengthen the relationship like picking up after ourselves. Strength in relationships isnâ€™t how much you fight but what you talk about. Kids need place to explore and be themselves reject the parent. Give your kids room to fail and build resilience
- Building Confidence and Resiliency in Teenagers
  Key takeaways:
  - Confidence is self-trust, not just feeling good about yourself.
  - Confidence is about being okay with not being the best at something and trusting yourself in those moments.
  - Confidence and resilience are related concepts.
  - Building confidence requires a clear understanding of the trait.
  - Actionable strategies may not always be effective in building confidence.

  Speaker 2
  So that leads naturally into sort of confidence and specifically resiliency. What can we do as parents of teenagers to build that resiliency? I mean, obviously giving our kids room to fail and opportunities to struggle aside from that. What is it that we can do? And like, are there specific things that we can do that you're like, oh, this is a great way to let your 14 or 15 year old fail or struggle or...
  Speaker 1
  I mean, I think they're kind of very, very related concepts, you know, confidence and resilience. But I'll start with kind of framing up confidence because I think the way I think about it is a little different. And again, if we're ever trying to build a trait, I think we have to be like so clear about what the trait is or else we're gonna be building something in a direction that might not be so productive.
  Speaker 2
  What's to find in both then confidence and resiliency, yeah.
  Speaker 1
  So to make confidence, I think people think about confidence as like feeling good about yourself. And like, I think that could not be further from what confidence is. To make confidence is self trust, which I think is very different from feeling good about yourself. And in a related way, you know, I think often like, confidence isn't feeling like the best at something. It's feeling like it's okay to be you when you're not the best at something. And it's like trusting yourself in those moments. So like I said to you earlier, I don't like to have ideas about actionable strategies because I can't operate that way. ([TimeÂ 0:25:01](https://share.snipd.com/snip/bcdb0d6c-7418-4e91-a994-69e52d0a0d38))
    - **Note:** Confidence isnâ€™t believing your the best but self trust in a situation. 3 lines to build resilience when people struggle donâ€™t shift double click. First tell them Iâ€™m so glad youâ€™re talking to me about this. This opens the door. Then tell them after they tell you something I believe then ask for them to tell you more. Learning you can trust your emotions is how you can regulate them and how you make good decisions you can focus on whatâ€™s next instead of trying to understand how you feel inside. If someone tolerates your disappointment then you realize youâ€™re still you when youâ€™re sad. We take responsibility from our behavior when we can more easily separate who we are from what we do. You will look to blame others for a bad tear grade instead of taking responsibility if it means you donâ€™t think youâ€™re stupid. Shame is when we use behavior as identity when this happens you need to change your goal. Shame is a frozen response and you need to thaw. Yiu need to lower shame. You can deshame with a support response de shame then connect.

  That's the worst, right? Because even think about me, if I showed up for this podcast with you late, Shane, I was like, you have no idea about traffic. Oh my goodness, oh my goodness, it was so bad. And my commute was awful. If you're like, that is the worst. Oh, I had that happen to me once too. I really do think the next thing I would say to you, like, I'm sorry, I should have left earlier. Where if you're like, I mean, Becky, look, we only have a little bit of time. And like, maybe it was traffic, like you really could have just, I don't know, left your apartment earlier and gotten to the studio. I know what I'd say back is like, he doesn't even understand traffic. The traffic was so bad. I would have gotten, so it's paradoxical, but it's so effective. And you can be Shane by just actually saying like, oh, that's the worst. It's usually pretty simple, or to me, like one of the most beautiful strategies. It's hard to even call it a strategy. It's just, I call it like, did I tell you about the time? But it's just like leveling with your kid about a story from your own childhood. That was just like that. Oh, that makes me think about when I was in seventh grade, it's not the same. But like, I remember the science test, I was like, what, this question's on? And this question's on? And you can kind of watch, I'm gonna kind of like do a little trick here. And part of me was like, I guess I could have studied that, but the teacher never told me. And the teacher never even told me. And so, oh, something like that happened to me too. And so what you're doing in the moment is you're actually just reconnecting with your kid. You're actually prioritizing connection. Connect first is like the principle we all want to try to do as often with our kids, not because we're soft, but actually because it's effective if you want to get anything done. So I'm just connecting, I'm de-shaming, I'm connecting. And once I've formed that connection with my kid, and they've kind of unfrozen a little bit, I can then enter into like a different conversation, but it just has to happen later than we Want it to.
  Speaker 2
  One of the things I wanted to come back to outside of the world of teens and maybe inside the adult world here is, you said earlier how we think about someone affects how we communicate With them. ([TimeÂ 0:38:24](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8c7140a7-038c-4898-b139-5d5c518b597d))
    - **Note:** How we think about someone effects how we communicate with them but likewise how we think about ourselves effects the stories we tell ourselves. You have these voices that say youâ€™re a mess up and we have them but we need to keep them in the passengers seat. We canâ€™t have them be in control telling us weâ€™re a failure. When we hear those we need to push them to the backseat. We canâ€™t get rid of them. Whenever I have something negative happen to me I bring in my boss wants to fire me voice or I hate myself voice and we create a relationship with these stories. To regulate our emotions we need to get curious about ourselves. Get curious itâ€™s no oneâ€™s fault. To regulate emotions we need to use avp aknowledge validate and permit. Youâ€™re saying hi to your feeling allowing it to be there and then give yourself full permission to feel that way. Then say you can cope with it.

  Speaker 1
  Some of us have, it's all my fault. Some of us have, oh, the world is gonna end and everything is gonna go badly, right? We get into problems not when those things are our passengers. We get into problems and those things take over the driver's seat. And actually a lot of us when we're aware of those voices, we try to get them out of our car like we do. We're like, I shouldn't feel that way. I know my boss doesn't actually think I'm stupid. Why am I thinking that? We either fight the voice or it kind of takes over us. Like that's usually what happens. When I actually think mental health is not about getting those voices out of our car. They're there, they're not going anywhere. But actually just like talking to them when they're in the passenger seat to ensure that they don't take over the driver's seat, right? So for example, not first of yelling at my kids and maybe like, oh, there's the I messed up my kid forever again, voice, hey, you, it's unfortunate but you do tend to come up whenever I make A little mistake with my kid. And like, okay, I'm just going to come back to today. Like it is 2024. And I don't really know what the next 80 years, kind of hold, but I'm pretty sure what I did today did not mess up my kids forever. And I know you'll say that again to me, but I'm just going to kind of keep you in the backseat, right? Or, oh, okay, I don't even feel great about my presentation and my boss did do this, but there's that, my boss hates me voice. And it's true, whenever I even doubt myself a little bit, I do tend to also think that my boss is about to fire me. And all of a sudden now, I'm actually in a relationship with these stories, right? Or with these parts, I would call them these parts. And as soon as you're in a relationship with the part of you, inherently that part of you can't take over you because you and the driver's seat are like talking to it. And to me, that's what I actually teach adults and parents like all the time. It's honestly like some of my favorite interventions to teach kids how to do that when they're young. I think it's like one of the most important skills I could take into adulthood with them because I think those are some of the ultimate coping skills in life.
  Speaker 2
  One of the other things we talked a bit earlier, and I'm sort of going down a couple of rabbit holes because we sort of covered a lot of ground really quickly, was regulating emotions. And not only do we, as adults and parents, have to teach our kids or help them better regulate their own emotions, we have to often learn how to regulate our own emotions. How do we do that?
  Speaker 1
  I get this question from parents often, right? Because the way kids learn how to regulate emotions is through their relationship with their parents. It's not something you could get taught in a textbook. And it's not to say when we get older, if we don't have a lot of those early experiences, that helped us learn how to regulate our emotions, which most adults, I know a lot of them didn't, Doesn't mean we can't get there. But our kids, right, they kind of borrow our regulation in a moment, and they kind of absorb it. And like I was saying before, they kind of over time learn, oh, my emotion inside me that feels so scary to me is less scary to someone else. And they kind of absorb that hope, and they absorb that kind of tolerance. And that really forms the foundation for so many of their coping skills. So parents will say to me, okay, I actually get that. How can I do that for my kid if I can't, if I really do struggle to regulate my own emotions? It seems like I'm teaching my kid and myself at the same time. And we are. And like that is just kind of the hand, a lot of us were dull, and it's not an impossible hand. It's not an easy hand, but it's definitely a winnable hand. Like I know that and I've seen it now with millions of adults who are winning a lot of their hands. And so I think there's a couple like concrete ways as adults that we can start to learn how to better regulate our emotions, right? Number one to me is just the word curiosity. Like being curious about yourself is a foundation to regulating your emotions. Because it's the difference between saying, my kids whining, like who can stay calm when they whine all day? Like are you saying people like whining? I have to get to a place where I like whining? No, nobody likes whining. Literally nobody likes whining. But there's a big difference between not liking whining and I don't know, reacting and being in a state of reactivity with screaming at our kids versus not liking whining and being able To regulate our emotions and respond to our kid from a place of groundedness and sturdiness, right? Still nobody likes it but it's very different. And curiosity to me gets us from point one to point two because instead of saying like, what's wrong with my kid and why are they acting the way they're acting, we might say, what's going On inside of me? What's going on for me? What is happening inside me? That is kind of a component of this reaction, right? The idea that my kids whining isn't inherently making me scream at them. It's a trigger but there's a story inside me. There's something that happens inside my body that frankly predated my kid's existence. So if I can get curious about that, right? Then I can actually make a lot of progress. And to me, I think it's so easy to hear that. And someone say, oh, so it's my fault? No, like I don't know where I feel like we're obsessed with the word fault. Like it's not your kid's fault, it's not your fault.

  Speaker 1
  Like in a way what I'm doing is like, I'm the driver of my car and annoyance in the backseat is like starting to kind of make its way to the driver seat. And I'm like, hey there, hey. And that's literally what I'm doing. I actually use the word high a lot because it always makes me laugh. And to me if I could add levity to like that process it gets easier. So I'm like, high annoyance or high anxiety, right? Or something like that. So if a step one is just acknowledge, you can acknowledge by using a quote feeling word like high annoyance or high sadness. A lot of people don't like really know the name of their feelings and that's totally fine. And you can also do it in a more general way. Like I'm feeling uncomfortable right now. I'm feeling about to explode right now. I'm feeling tight right now. Any acknowledgement to is validate. And to me the best way that our body I think likes to be validated. I don't know why is the term makes sense. I think there's something where feelings feel like accepted by logic in our body when we use that term. I don't know. I haven't like I haven't asked but I think that's what's happening. So I'd be saying, I'm really, really annoyed right now. Or when my kid was whining and I'd say to myself, well, that makes sense. Like whining is pretty annoying. It makes sense that I feel that way. That is a hugely helpful phrase in regulating our emotions because the reasons our emotions get unregulated, right? Is that they are exploding out of our body in our behaviors. They literally if you think about these moments of reactivity when I yell or right. The emotion is like coming out of my body and like through my mouth, right? It's kind of like a volcano, right? The opposite of that isn't suppressing emotions because you just can't beat them. So it's always, you know, an unwinnable, you know, endeavor. But we're kind of saying when you regulate an emotion like it's okay to live inside your body. Like it can just live there. It doesn't have to explode out of you. It can live inside there. Like it has a place that has a home. So if you think about those two steps already like for some saying hi to it. Like if you're saying hi to someone at a party like maybe you don't love them but you're probably like, okay with them being there because you said hi. And then you're telling, you're feeling like it kind of makes sense that you're here. And then P is permit, which actually just is involved saying yourself, I give myself full permission to be feeling this way, right? So another example of going through an AVP who would be like, I'm feeling really anxious right now and really, really worked up. And you know, well, that makes sense. Like I am managing my kid soccer schedules and you know, I'm thinking about what they need for dinner and I didn't respond to that email. And I think tomorrow is gonna be a snow day and then my kids are gonna have canceled school and P permit, right? I give myself permission to be feeling this way. And I think a kicker at the end is just adding the phrase and I can cope with it. And I can cope with it. I, you know, interesting enough you're catching me on like last night I was walking in Times Square. And as I do, I film videos myself on Instagram and I'm like on the way to the subway. So I was like filming myself and this guy saw me he's this 28 year old guy, stop me. He goes, I'm a 28 year old man, I'm unmarried. And I don't have kids. And he goes, and I like, I'm so excited to see you. He's like, you're like a celebrity to me. And he goes, literally he goes, AVP has changed my life. That's what he said. AVP has changed my life. I'm re-parenting myself. I know I never learned what some people learned in their childhood and I need to kind of re-parent myself through those skills. And AVP has like, you know, changed my life. And so there's a couple ways to use it. If regulating your emotions is new for you, you can't expect yourself to start to regulate your emotions when you're in your most heightened emotions. That would be like someone who has never taken a foul shot, taking a foul shot, game seven of the NBA Finals when time is run out and the game is tied. Like that person is not making it. You take foul shots in practice, low stakes. And so the way I tell people to practice AVP is literally going to their phone right now, setting a random time that they tend to be alone, right? Not in the midst of things. And just literally making a daily reminder that says AVP. And when it goes off, you just stop. And you say to yourself, what am I feeling right now? And it can be like, I'm not feeling much. I don't know. Well, that makes sense because this is a new thing for me to check in with my emotions. So it makes sense that I'm not sure permission. I'm giving myself full permission to not know how I'm feeling. Like there's no way to get it wrong. That's what I'm saying. And I promise you after a week or two, not only will you start to recognize more things, but already that skill, that coping skill will start to appear not in 10 out of 10 emotional situations. It's not magic. But like in maybe two, three out of 10s. And I think that's like one concrete thing like all adults can do to start making progress.

- The Power of Repair in Parenting
  Key takeaways:
  - Repair is one of the most powerful relationship strategies
  - You can't repair if you don't mess up
  - The first step to repair is admitting that you messed up
  - Repair is important, especially for kids
  - Concrete ways to repair after yelling at a child
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And what I always like to think about there is, okay, so if repair is one of the most powerful relationship strategies, and I'm supposed to get good at repair, well, you can't repair if You don't mess up, you literally can't. And so really, okay, and I'll go through how to repair after I yell at my kid, I really do say this to myself because I used to be pretty bad at repairing until I understood really the power Of it. I'm like, oh, I messed up. And especially with this like Dr. Becky stuff, I'm like, what would people think? If like, right, like I was yelling at my kids and I was like, wait, I'm getting good at repair. That's like my goal. So I messed up step one, check, like crushed it, crushed it. I messed up. I already did step one. Everyone says the first step is the hardest step. Okay. Well, first step is messing up. We did that. Second step is repair. Like you're 50% of the way there. So I want to take this whole idea and like turn on its head, repair is so important. So I want to explain why repair is so important, especially for kids and then get into the concrete way to do it. So I just yelled at my kid. And now usually in my house after I yell at my kid, like we're separated. Like after I really scream like my kids in this room, let's say my son's in this room. And let's say it's about screen time. I'm like, I told you to get off, you know, the video game and like, you never listen. And you, you know, take advantage of me. And like you said, and I don't know if I can trust you. And, you know, when he's like, you don't understand me. And I was just with my friends and you embarrass me. And I'm like, you've seen nothing yet. Okay. ([TimeÂ 0:56:13](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c0fce99e-2ff8-4992-a187-ed04e0787c7d))
    - **Note:** The power of repair this is the most important part. When you fuck up take a step back and think wow I just took a step to help repair a relationship because you canâ€™t repair if you donâ€™t err. Kids 2 coping mechanism are self doubt and self blame. Self blame is adaptive as kids but maladaptive when you donâ€™t have a caregiver you can fully trust. Events donâ€™t mess up people but the story we tell ourselves mess up people donâ€™t change events change memories you need to separate your negative behaviors from your identity you canâ€™t repair with the negative mindset you must say youâ€™re a good parent who did something wrong you canâ€™t repair if youâ€™re feeding a bad narrative to yourself desperate identity from what you did. This isnâ€™t Deflectibg blame to taking responsibility as long as you associate behavior with identity you canâ€™t change. If youâ€™re in a state of self blame you canâ€™t reflect change or wonder youâ€™re safe in this fake world and thatâ€™s failure reall success is growth past this. Not an excuse.
- Understanding Your Partner's Feelings in a Relationship
  Key takeaways:
  - Most fights between partners are fueled by a desire for the other person to be more like oneself
  - Differences between partners are often what attracted them initially but can later repel them
  - When a partner expresses their feelings, they are not necessarily blaming the other person or claiming to be in the right
  - Sharing feelings can be an opportunity to learn more about one's partner

  Speaker 1
  No, you're zero percent crazy. And so much of this resonates with me too. And I can get like this too. So there's a couple of things that you said that I think we need to like, you know, not like break down, but like poke around. That's what I would say. So first of all, most of us when we're married, like right, or partnered, whatever we are, like the way we react to our spouse when they bring us up something they're feeling is we do, we Get very like kind of egocentric. I do this too where it's like, well, I wouldn't feel that way. Like, right? And I think most fights partners get in are kind of, they're both saying to the other person, why can't you be more like me? And then I'm like, well, why can't you be more like me? Why can't you be more like me? Right, we all find our partners inherently. We've retracted them because of all the ways they're kind of different from us. And then over time, we become a little bit repelled by those exact same things. That's like marriage, right? And so those different, those differences I think are at the core, right? And so I actually think this relates to that feeling bench a lot, right? So your partner is coming to you essentially saying, I don't know, I'm gonna make up a situation. Tell me if like it's close enough. Like you didn't text me and tell me that you weren't gonna stop at the store. And like, I'm really mad because I would have then gone by myself, I don't know. Is that close enough? Or you didn't text me for two days and I thought you would text me in between. Or you know, like you were traveling. Right, you didn't text me for two days when you were traveling. Like you didn't even reach out to see how the last two days are going. Like I'm really mad, right? Okay, great. So I know this sounds silly, but I think I should really slow this down because what your partner is saying is, what your partner's not saying is a couple of things. They're not saying you did anything so abhorrent. They're not saying I'm right to feel mad because like that's the right feeling in the world. That's like the right feeling in the world. And they're not saying you're a horrible person. And they're not saying you're at fault. I think the first thing that really helps when our partner shares how they feel is my partner is inviting me to get to know more about them.

    - **Note:** Sharing feelings is an invitation to learn more about someone else. Theyâ€™re showing a vulnerable part and making a bid for connection disagreement is saying you donâ€™t agree with their thinking so you can dismiss or get curious getting to know more about someone understanding how someone feels in a deep way is different from agreement seek to understand there is no right or wrong. You donâ€™t need to agree or disagree just be curious and see how the world looks from someone elseâ€™s lense. Get on the same side of the problem and attack it. You can create a relationship based on events and rewards thatâ€™s empty you need to create a genuine relationship based on human interactions and direct connection or eventually it just falls away. Treat children like adults and let your kid struggle so they can feel capable.
