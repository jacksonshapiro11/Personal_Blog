  Speaker 1
  In the following days, my mother watched the televised show trials of petisa's henchman, led by cegevero, and succumbed to the hypnotic chant. It's in spanish, and could translate it. Against the wall, against the wall. She felt er. She's young too. She doesn't understand. Her father e nails it. He gets it right away. She felt that there was no difference between a mock and a real trial, as the outcome would have been the same. But my grandfather, her father, viewed the proceedings and subsequent firing squad executions with distaste and maintained that they marked the beginning of the end. He was right. A few weeks later, castro nationalized my grandfather's department store, who called it shortly afterward, everyone in my mother's family boarded a flight for the united states. And so then we go back to this meeting that lobo is having with chey. And the author does a great job of just talking about how crazy lobo's life was. This is just unbelievable, like somany the stories that we study on the spot, casen why i think reading biography is just just so important. You just see the full scope and the wide variance that a life can that can happen in one lifetime. Lobo walked with a limp due to a murder attempt 14 years before that had blown a four inch chunk out of his skull after he'd supposedly refused to pay 50 thousand dollars in protection Money to a gang of cuban mobsters.

    - **Note:** Llobo actually funded Castro to take down Bautista because he didn’t realize he would be a communist he thought he was for democracy lobo had more money than god 30% of cubas gdp was from sugar and he owned half of that. Real life magnate. Lobo made and lost 2 Fourtune’s. Lobo idolized napoleon and thought he was playing angles when dealing with Castro but he was wrong Castro was irrational and he would rather lose the sugar trade and have his people starve than ceede power but lobo didn’t realize this when it was too late and lost his money. He didn’t offshore assets and the writing on the wall and kept his money in Cuba not accepting it was over until he lost it all. First don’t lose then win he was too stupid to realize this. Lobos cognitive dissonance distracted him from the obvious and he had everything taken fleeing to Mexico with nothing because he couldn’t see the truth

  Speaker 1
  Even as a young man, he focused every on he focused everything with a he focused with a passionate and single minded determination. His friend in college describes him, he was an individualist who did not spare himself any sacrifice to attain his objectives. He has a fantastic work ethic. This is when hoa when hole was in his twenties. This is advice from his dad. One of surviving letters i was just telling u about. Most of the surviving letters are from his father. They began offering sage advice to a young man about to begin his career. And they end in tones of respect towards a man he regarded as his equal. So they went being partners. His father then retires and takes over and drastically expands the business. And his father says, take care, work with faith, cultivate your spirit and dominate your passions. That's he repeats, eern evergan, dominate your passions, don't let them dominate you. Suc you. Really good advice. And i'm not sure lobo actually heeded that advice. And so in the book, there is a million stories of these boom and bust that happen in commodity markets. I'm going o read this to you. This is a huge boom om bus during his first year in the sugar business. I'll tell you, like my own take away here, i don't understand, like i talk to a lot of uch printers, founders, t just, it seems like they're just obsessed with speculation, when to me, Like the clearest path, the clearest path to wealth that you actually have influence and control over, is building a business that benefits somebody else's life. Like make a product service that makes omebody else's life better, right? ([Time 0:31:17](https://share.snipd.com/snip/67d99cb3-052c-4845-8950-1eee4163970c))
    - **Note:** Lobo wanted wealth and power from a young age and would read about great men. His dad was kicked out of Venezuela when he was young and had to flee to Cuba with nothing. Focused passionately strong work ethic and single minded focus on sugar. Dominate your passions lobo had extreme agency. Make a product that makes others lives better don’t speculate. His dad understood mistakes are inevitable and promoted him early so he could counsel him when he made big decisions that led to mistakes. Lobo speculates on sugar and lost everything he wanted to give it all up but his dad held him steady in this time where he basically fucked it because of his over speculation. Lobo is held to a wall and almost excuted during a coup. This changes his outlook and made him impatient for success. He then executed a perfect short squeeze on the sugar market which was run by curropt governments at this point like oil.

    - **Note:** Speculation is not a good business plan and eventually your luck runs out because you’re guessing. Just because something has gone up in the past it doesn’t guarantee it will come back and isn’t a reason to buy it. Speculation is bad and you’ll always believe it goes higher until it doesn’t. Speculators are risk barers not risk takers and can have tail advantage. Lobo viewed business as a game like chess. He would respond to overnight messages at breakfast and have responses before he came to work he got a head start at 8 of the New York guys who came in at 10. Business was intellectual exercise. He wanted to check mate other men and thus had no relationships of meaning do positive sum games with people to create the life you want. You can be rich and loved but you need to choose that life of time with important friends not passing up or ignoring important relationships very cautionary tale in that front.

    - **Note:** Lobo found time to exercise and read a ton still. He loved reading and studying. He was a speculator and almost lost it all this was the darkest time in his life because the loss was entirely on him and no one else. He had many failures but this haunted him because it was all his fault. He switched to his second act which was making sugar. On the other side of the table. He created many smaller mills instead of one giant centralized mills. Most mills were managed remotely but he was very hands on and saw from the front. Lobo was arrogant and not afraid of people who shouldn’t be afraid of like people trying to kill him. He thought his was invincible and this almost got him killed. Heed warnings. This led to the darkest year in his life he was almost killed than both his parents died he got divorced and his brother killed himsekf.

    - **Note:** He was strong willed and excellence is the capacity to take pain but he never grew he would cycle up then back down never making progress. He was so focused with what money could buy he neglected the important parts of life it couldn’t. A calm mind fit body and love can’t be bought but are valuable. Left Cuba with negative net worth and started speculating again he made millions but didn’t take profit it wasn’t enough he let it ride lost it all had to declare bankruptcy instead of riding into the sunset. He was a man who ruled the world and shaped markets but his speculation lead to his success and downfall and ended up living off payment from his daughters broke
