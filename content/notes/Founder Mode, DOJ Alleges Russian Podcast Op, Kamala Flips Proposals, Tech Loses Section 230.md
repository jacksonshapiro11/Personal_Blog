- Forge Your Unique Path in Business
  Summary:
  Successful businesses thrive on uniqueness and the ability to think from first principles rather than relying on conventional methods.
  Founders often possess a blend of fearlessness and naivety, motivating them to innovate despite lacking exhaustive analysis. Pre-product market fit, qualities such as risk-taking, curiosity, and relentless iteration are essential.
  Transitioning from early-stage to scaling requires a rare skill set, often absent in trained managers who use cookie-cutter approaches.
  Companies like Airbnb and Uber exemplify the importance of identifying a unique operational path to avoid commoditization and create lasting value.

  Here's how a business is run. Here's how this person did it. Here's how this company did it. And then they go and they try and cookie cutter repeat that. That doesn't really work, because every business if it's going to be successful, it has to be unique. And so the ability to actually think uniquely and identify from first principles, the means necessary to achieve the mission of the organization, I think is a critical, critical leadership Trait. Maybe that, yeah, that leader can come from a founder or not. But this ability to kind of ignore convention, ignore comparables and think for yourself.
  Speaker 3
  I don't see most founders starting a business because they've done some first principles analysis. I see most founders starting companies because they see a gap that they're pretty sure exists. But I think the biggest thing that founders have is this intersection of fearlessness and naivety. And so if they knew too much, they would never do it. That, I don't think, necessarily means that the entire set of all of those people are actually great first principles thinkers. The first principles is required after product market fit. What's required before product market fit is risk taking, curiosity, relentless iteration, and those are a very different set of characteristics. Is it true that sub-founders can then change their toolkit? Absolutely. But is it true that, quote unquote, because you have a title, you have those things? Absolutely not. Otherwise, we would have a much higher success rate in Silicon Valley than we do. There is a reason why 95% of these companies go to zero. It's because the ability to do the first thing is rare, and then the ability to transition is even more rare.

  Well, building a unique business. And I think if you look at Airbnb, and I'll give Brian Chesky incredible credit for this, you look at Uber, you look at how Steve Jobs built Apple, what every one of these businesses have In common is that they were all built in a unique way. And I think that's what makes great businesses is that they identify their own path, their own unique path for how to operate a business to scale to achieve the mission of the organization. And I think that that's what's typically lacking in trained managers who use comparables and biases from their prior experience and what they've been trained and taught to use as a Cookie cutter type model, which doesn't create unique value, it makes your business look like the other. And ultimately, it commoditizes some aspect of the business to the point that the value of the business goes down. But to build something unique where you're constantly finding the unique path that gives you an advantage is what all of these companies have in common. Whether that unique path was made by an experienced hired person or a first-time founder, it's this ability to kind of build a unique competency that I think makes them all distinct As a group.

    - **Note:** Fearless and naieve. Follow your path.
- Seek Knowledge, Find Success
  Summary:
  The evolution of the entrepreneurial landscape has shifted to a focus on empowering founders, as the past model of professional management is outdated.
  Founders, regarded as pivotal figures, require ongoing learning and development rather than constant affirmation of their infallibility. Exceptional individuals, like Eric Schmidt, exemplify the rare mastery of their fields, with the ability to engage deeply on complex topics.
  Learning from such individuals is crucial; they provide unique insights that can steer projects in the right direction.
  Cultivating relationships with those who have a proven track record of success can lead teams closer to their goals.
  The emphasis lies on solving real problems and leveraging the expertise of others to enhance learning and innovation.

  And just I think the turning point was when Peter started Founders Fund, but that was over 20 years ago. In other words, Peter realized that that old approach in the 90s of bringing in the professional management had run its course and that we needed to help founders level up and stay in The seat for as long as possible. That was 22 years ago that he created that firm. So we're like decades into this and that's what kind of feels anachronistic about this whole discussion is it's almost like we're pretending like we're still in a world in which founders Aren't celebrated and exalted. It's quite the contrary. They can do almost anything. And the question is, how do you help them level up? And at some point, if you're constantly just saying that, well, founders know everything, founders always write, is that actually helping them? Or is it actually reinforcing a mentality that, oh, I don't have to learn anything? Because that all the great founders have been learning machines. But if they had been told throughout that, you're always right, don't worry about it, then they may not have learned the same way.

  Well, I had a meeting with Eric Schmidt a few weeks ago, which blew my mind. And I think I called Freiburg right afterwards. But this is just an example of like, there are just people that know how to win. He is one of those people. So as part of 8090, one of the things that we're doing is we're building a transpiler, you know, right now, everybody is very much fixated on PyTorch. The problem with PyTorch and building to NVIDIA is you have this thing called CUDA in the middle of it, which is owned by NVIDIA. I think that over time that's problematic. The long-term solution is you need a functional transpiler that can take CUDA-lithered code but be able to compile it without losing performance to any hardware, so Amazon hardware, Google TPU, etc. So Eric and I sat down, we were together for a couple days when we were in Europe and we had like an hour, 90-minute meeting. The level of technical detail and mastery that he had blew me away. And he asked hundreds of very, very, very specific questions, some of which I knew the answers to, some of which I didn't. I was able to ask him what he thought he was able to go into the weeds in an enormous amount of detail. And what I thought was, where is he finding the time to know as much as he does about compilers and the specifics of AI at this level of detail. And the story of telling you this example is just more that that is a kind of person that is just rare and unique. You can't put a label on that person. And you just want that person near you because he has the ability to help you in a way that most other people just do not, irrespective of whatever their title is. So it just goes to say, you got to focus on the actual meat of the problem. And in that specific case, he gave us two technical directions that my team and I are exploring now with this goal that if one of them pans out, I'll go back to Eric and say, look, we tried These things, this is working, this is not working, what do you think? And it was an incredibly helpful meeting to me. And he just offered that time to me. And so my point is, people like this exist. And I think that the whole goal, if you're trying to win, seek those people out independent of what they're doing, what they're telling them on your team, learn, learn from them as much As you can. And hopefully you get one step closer to winning and get them on your team if possible. ([Time 0:48:53](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b92b7656-9343-4bb0-8186-82f10f225920))
