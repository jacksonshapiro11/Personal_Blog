  2. Perspective is key; many people manage to live fulfilling lives on much less than two to three million.

- True Wealth Lies in Time, Not Just Money
  Summary:
  Money is not the sole measure of sufficiency; having two to three million can provide a comfortable life, especially when considering lifestyle choices, cost of living, and personal needs.
  Many people live on much less; thus, perspective is key. True freedom comes from having time rather than just wealth, emphasizing that meaningful experiences often cost little or nothing, such as good food, relationships, and nature.
  The relentless pursuit of money can lead to dissatisfaction, while appreciating what is affordable can enhance happiness.
  Ultimately, while higher amounts like 20 to 30 million may facilitate desired luxuries and experiences, one's happiness should not be contingent on achieving those financial goals.

  Speaker 1
  I just feel like a better discussion isn't like what is the absolute number. Look two to three million is enough and that like if you told me I had to survive on two to three million forever and that my existence depended on it. And'd be like, okay, I would just like move to Thailand or something and I'd be fine, right? So if that's the nature of the discussion then sure.
  Speaker 4
  And to be fair, I think what he's suggesting is that that's the case. Like that is enough. It's enough in the earth to do that.
  Speaker 1
  But but but like to your point those are choices like what is enough is really the the thing. Like what are you trying to buy with the money and how much of that do you need to buy and like what do you need to buy and like where do you need to be like that those are the questions not like.
  Speaker 4
  Well let me just start let me start on how I feel about it because like Arman nailed me correctly like I think that's that's sufficient and Here's a couple reasons why For the simplest Reason is that like most people on earth don't have that and they get by so like that's fine It was an average savings for like a 50 year old like $70,000 or some $60,000. I don't think like what's the number of Americans that live paycheck-to with no savings? It's like more than 50% and then like you go to like I don't know like this is is is definitely enough, right? I think the next point that he makes is like you're richer than Jeff Bezos like What he's talking about there is like you're like you have freedom of time What we experienced just like Last week was that like freedom of time is like incredibly valuable and like this like some of the stuff We did was expensive and again that badass house or whatever But like a lot of it Was like the simplest stuff ever that we like really enjoyed thoroughly enjoyed Which is like spending time with your friends like being outdoors. Yeah. And like that is fucking cheap. It's very reasonable to like live in a way that like fills your cups. That doesn't cost a lot.
  Speaker 2
  This is so obvious to me. Yeah, I think it's easy to get wrapped up in the details. That's why you know I'm a no nuance on this discussion because I think that that is not as interesting as like the just generally like What what is it that drives the happiness in life? It's not about that money It's not about like your cost of living am I still working am I not still working? I think the purpose of this little secret to share is that the best stuff is cheap, if not free. It's like good food, good relationships, exercise, great sex, calling your parents, good sleep, but if you're in the pursuit of money, there's no end to that. That's a very simple argument. And that if you have the benefit of time on your side, which none of us do, because we don't know what our last day will be, but if you have the benefit of youth on your side, then you should Be even more grateful compared to Jeff Bezos.
  Speaker 3
  You're gonna need more money if you're having youth on your side.
  Speaker 4
  Well, what I described about this like you have the you have like the freedom of time when you have this much money you have the freedom of time you don't have the freedom of experiences Like you don't you can't live like Jeff Bezos experiences on this dollar amount you can't but I think that's like something that is okay to sacrifice to like check off like 90% of somebody's
  Speaker 2
  Bucket list might be. Yeah. My guess is for all of us, or at least for most of us, then the real number is probably 10x that. Where we're in a position where we're actually able to do everything that we really want to do. And that might sound ridiculous to some people out there, but I think that's just the reality is like 20 to 30 million is probably the want the passive income that I want to be able to provide For my family the way that I want to be able to have the toys that I want the experiences that I want because I want to travel in a certain way and I want to be able to do certain things. And that's just, you know, it is what it is. It doesn't mean I need that to be happy. But I think it's a fun goal. I think it's cool to to strive for. It doesn't mean I'm going to be unhappy or that I'm greedy until I get there. I just think it's a fun game to play personally speaking. Yeah.
