  And you're going to see traits that he had when he was a kid that he continued his entire life. They call there's a there's a funny line in the book where they said that M.W. Was a self-confident five-year He showed signs of being argumentative and strong willed from a very early age. He had a great need for independence and control. Remember, he's a kid. He's like this his whole life. And ([Time 0:09:09](https://share.snipd.com/snip/85a287a9-eee3-438d-aaf6-faf7d0200700))
- Marcus gets married young and impulsively his dad counsels him that marriage is about connection and long term view as much about short term passion. Marcus still was ruthlessly independent and did what he wanted. Dont ask for permission. Marriage optimizes for life not passion. The family was involved in banking, industrial ownership of defaulted businesses they tried to revive, then investment into new businesses investment arm and holding company. Marcus needs control and loves investing in technology and they rarely ever sell. Often butts his head with his brother due to control needs. They never give up they restructure and consolidate. This gives them actionable insights about the future allows them to stay in the game and market which leads to innovation. They drop business lines and double down on what’s working. Be careful who you associate with. They don’t associate with ivar Kruger who bankrupts another bank and destroy another bank but this allows them to control more when the other bank folds. The company basically acquires and holds forever at one point employing 40% of Swedes.

  Was actually able to persuade them, to persuade the management of the bank, to take his son on as a trainee, which was totally against the bank's procedures and principles. And so up until this point, MW has kind of followed the path that his dad wanted him to embark on. And then we see his dad finds out really early, and he probably knew this from when he was a kid, that he's going to exert his own will. And so he writes to his dad, hey, guess what? I met a woman. I love her. And I'm getting married. And so obviously, if you're trying to perpetuate a family dynasty, who your kids marry is extremely important. So there's a series of letters that go back and forth about this impending marriage. And again, I'm going to cut right to the chase. Like M.W. Now and throughout his entire life is going to get what he wants. He is not going to allow himself to be controlled by anybody. But it is fascinating where you see his father really trying to counsel his son and just how he thinks, like he's writing a letter to his son about how he actually thinks about marriage That, you know, when you're in your early 20s, you're not going to have this perspective. And so his father writes, it's the most natural thing in the world that a young man takes a fancy to a young lady. However, it's important to decide whether or not his fancy shall be decisive for the rest of his life. When young, one tends to believe Okay. And then true to his personality, when M.W. Writes to his father about wanting to get married, he essentially just presents it as a fait accompli. Like, I'm making this decision, it's going to happen, it does happen. But again, his father writes him in return, he says, he's like, I'm going to approve of your decision, but the approval is not given without reservation. So he says, I approve of your decision and congratulate you wholeheartedly. However, I do consider that a deferment is appropriate so that both parties have time for reflection. I'm more than happy to see my boys getting married and continuing our esteemed family. Experience shows that it is important not to make the wrong choice and be misled by one's feelings. Further reflection is recommended. And then marriage is not the only place that he's going to push back on his father. Again, he was MW from time he was young till time he was old. He was way more interested in industry than he is finance. So he's like, okay, I've studied in these banks. I don't want to study in the banks anymore. I want to go out ([Time 0:18:30](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5c07ec35-b571-43ac-91b0-cb8e6a2de9b6))
- MW Jr. admired his father's ability to innovate and create. He saw him as an "epoch maker" due to his versatility, knowledge, and good judgment. Cultivated relationships. The family developed industry owned most companies then forced them to use their bank kept money in the system. Obsessed with industry. They’re operators who improve business when they see something under performing they judge whether they should spin it out recap it or something else but never let money escape. Personal element of relationship was vital because the family would leverage their network to hire people and improve businesses strong flywheels constantly compounding. Embeace innovations their ideas was shift from the old. Marcus was strong headed figure things out for himself. .

  So now M.W. Is writing right after the death of his father. He said, you probably know better than most people what a wonderful father, friend, comrade, and mentor he was, and the strength of the ties with which we had developed with him. He has left a great void, but his spirit is so strong that it will live on forever among many of us. What M.W. Inherited from his father and turned to his own advantage was the ability to create something new. This is now how M.W. Thought about this. For the sake of civilization, I sincerely hope that the epoch of bold and constructive innovation has not come to an end with the passing away of my father. Innovation goes on constantly and is stronger than any regulation. The fact that he was often seen as the soul of an epoch, or regarded as an epoch maker, was probably due to his unusual qualities. Should other men of the same caliber emerge, I believe they will also be seen as epoch makers. M.W. Continues to describe his father. He was extremely versatile. He had a phenomenal memory and was very knowledgeable in all kinds of sciences and literature. He enjoyed music and knew about different technologies, and he mastered languages as well. And there's all these exclamation points again. I'm really surprised by these very reserved Swedes, how often MW used exclamation points. I do the same, so I love it. He was very interested in history and would tell stories about his various companies and about the difficulties he had encountered. He was talented, first of all, in terms of wisdom and intelligence, but he also had great judgment, industriousness, energy, and he also enjoyed good health and had a sense of responsibility. Really, the reason I'm reading this to you, because he's describing his father, but now that I know the full arc of M.W.'s life, you could use the same description of him as well.

- He’s completely non conformist. Steals the wife of the member of the royal family before divorce was common while married. The rules of the world don’t apply to him. At least he thinks they don’t and so they just don’t. That’s all it takes. Just don’t conform. He also gathers information constantly from those who work with him like Jensen did so he’s always in the loop. Takes control of the bank from his brother. He gets to know everyone management by walking around. Invested ruthlessly in technology. Wanted detailed info on everything and would blow up at someone in front of everyone else to prove a point and help learning like Jenson.

  He starts making the bank invest heavily in technology. And so in technology of their day, they have these punch card machines. So he buys a bunch of punch card machines then all and make sure that all accounting transactions inside of the bank have to be no longer done by hand. They have to be done on the technology of their day, which is the punch card machines, right? So as this result, all accounting transactions were transferred to punch cards, which led to a dramatic increase in efficiency. Productivity doubled. Twice as many transactions were carried out by a workforce that only had to increase from 425 employees to 550. ([Time 0:49:34](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ea357440-ea48-48ae-a84e-460f9cce2ce7))
- Invest in technology and maintain decisive influence. Needed control. Prioritize quality people, drive them hard, and constantly introduce new blood. Always had tons of energy. Ownership without presence rots. He was always asking questions and analyzed reports quickly and could easily cut to the core issue quickly. He’s a great man to work for but also very tough. He was a great man and small person. Don’t be a dick or asshole in business. His son messes something up big and he scholds him. His son then kills himself as a result of this. His dad was very hurt but had to move on raise the next generation. Brutal event and time in his life but you need to just keep going through hell. Loved his entire life like a man who had lost his son and brought up his grandson who was a kid who had lost his father. He took responsibility for taking over the family business. His entire life and destiny was executing on this.

  MW was the chairman of the board for 33 separate companies and on the board of another 80 companies. His style, I would say, is much more in line with what Sam Zell said, where he set up all of his companies and everything he was in. Sam said, I am the chairman of everything and the CEO of nothing. There's a couple other things, and I just made a list because, you know, they reappear over and over again. And so I just made a list of how I think about MW's entrepreneurial philosophy. Okay. Number one, he wants to invest in technology. Number two, he wants decisive influence over the company he is working on or investing in. Number three, he's going to impatiently push things forward constantly, which leads to number four, which seems paradoxical. And the paradox is MW's short-term impatience combined with the long-term perseverance of the Wallenberg family in their industrial matters. The list continues. Number five, the quality of the people is most important. In fact, let me interrupt the list. I'm going to read this section to you and I'll get back to my list. When judging companies, MW considered that the capacity of its top people was generally the most important ingredient. He therefore chose executive managers with great care. He kept himself well informed about new names, drove his managers extremely hard, and moved others aside if they were not up to the task. Those of his own generation who had allied themselves closely with him earlier were gradually moved to one side in favor of new blood. He demanded unlimited work and loyalty from his managing directors and all of his industrial companies. Number five, the quality of the people is most important. Number six, he believed in driving people hard. Number seven, he wanted new blood. And number eight, he had tons of expansive energy for new initiatives. And number nine is one of his favorite sayings that he would repeat. He said, ownership without presence rots. Ownership without presence rots. What does he mean? Go in person, be seen, be prepared. Let me just give you a quick example of this. It's also important to him to study industrial operations at first hand, to forge contacts with on-site personnel, and to be visible.
