### Highlights

- Episode AI notes
  1. Asking the right question can lead to surprising and impactful conversations. When the speaker wrote a letter to President Johnson, they received a response that sparked their curiosity. Instead of asking the expected questions, they asked President Johnson about the best lesson his father taught him, leaving him surprised and speechless.
  2. Overcoming fear and building resilience is a valuable lesson that can be learned from challenging experiences. The speaker learned not to be afraid of challenges after realizing that their imagination exaggerated the worst outcomes. They felt fear before a karate tournament but discovered that it wasn't as bad as they imagined. This experience allowed them to develop a sense of awareness and choice, which they used to overcome future challenges.
  3. Recognizing the connections that are all around can lead to incredible opportunities. Father Hesburgh, a theologian and social activist, was one of the most influential leaders of the 20th century. He served as president of Notre Dame for 35 years and advised presidents and popes. His autobiography, 'God Country Notre Dame,' is a great starting point to learn more about him and the important role of human relationships in affecting change.

  Speaker 1
  But here's where that first story came in. Because when I wrote that letter to President Johnson and I got the response that I did, it was like putting a payment in that was gonna compound and start compounding. And so I wasn't panicked. I just was able to go in there because I knew there was a lot of compound curiosity in there. And I knew a secret that I hope everybody will walk out of this room with. And that is that the best questions make the person asked just as curious about the answer as you are. They might be even more curious about the answer than you are. So point of time arrives. Publicist escorts me into the conference room. And there he is. Go over me. He's a little older than I remembered. And I just looked at him and I knew he's there waiting for the first question to be about nuclear weapons, to be about Ronald Reagan, to be about world events. And I just right at the bat looked him in the eye and said, what's the best lesson your father taught you? And he's surprised. Doesn't say anything.

He had an interview with Gorbachev that got cut from 90 to 10 minutes. He still takes it and asks him not about the cold war but about lessons he learned from his dad and got him to open wide and Gorbachev pushed his entire calendar back to do the interview because he was asking questions that go to the heart not the head. When you asked canned questions you get canned answers ask to the heart then head to get to the soul.

  And he said, no, I got my ass kicked. There's no mistake about it. The guy knew what he was doing. And I really didn't. But after a while, I was able to land. By the end of it, I realized, yeah, I'm still here. And I did okay. And on the ride home, he just at four years old recognized. Look how I was before I went out on the mat. I was filled with fear. And the reason I was filled with fear is because my imagination took into account all the worst things that could happen to me. And it just blew them up. Then I went out and it wasn't anything like those worst things. It wasn't real. And so he said from that moment on, he was never afraid of a challenge because he would go back to that first moment where he was able to develop a sense of awareness around. It doesn't mean that something couldn't be difficult. It doesn't mean that there was something not to be concerned about. But he just made himself aware that I have a choice to let my imagination take this as far as it possibly could. Or I could just think of what happened to me on the mats, that karate tournament.
