### Highlights

- **CyberStarts' Sunrise Methodology**
  * Focus on identifying the most crucial pain point in the market by talking to large organizations and understanding their priorities.
  * Ask CISOs who they hate the most as a vendor, since vendor dislike motivates replacement.
  * Observe customer actions rather than just listening to their words to understand their true priorities.
  * Use the 'Sunrise' methodology: offer a virtual $100M R&D budget and ask organizations what problem they'd like solved.
  * Simulate future failures and build the company to handle these challenges.
  * Find very resilient founders optimize for that more than anything.

  And that shift in order, as simple as it sounds, I think that's what made CyberStarts a success for SETs and that's what helped all those amazing founders really feel the full potential Of their talents. We continue to evolve the Sunrise methodology because it's not just around product market feed. It's actually a program that takes an entrepreneur from day one, from inception, through the first three or four years of running their business. But the early days of the sunrise is all around focusing on finding the most important pain point in the market. And you do that by going out and speaking with large organizations, making sure you understand their priorities, what gives them the most and only that.
  Patrick O'Shaughnessy
  Can you describe that piece specifically in some detail?
  Gili Raanan
  The tactical method for who you're talking to, how many people you talk to, how often you do, like the real details here? I think it's such an interesting process. So keep in mind that our company is B2B SaaS. So all of them sell to large organizations. So obviously large organizations are the customers and they are who you like to ask the questions. And the best person to ask is the chief information security officer that oversees the security operation for that business. The idea behind Sunrise process is that you're going to chase pain and identify pain. That requires a lot of smartness, because if you're going to ask, go out and ask the chief information security officer, this week, what's your biggest pain? You'll get one answer. You ask the same person the same question in a week, you get a different answer. And then another week, you'll get another answer. And they're not playing games. They're just being human. There are other ways to identify pain. For instance, one of my most favorite questions is, who's the vendor you hate the most? Because if you don't like a vendor, that's a big motivation for you to displace that vendor. Another important observation is wards are cheap. So don't look at what the customer says, look at what the customer does. Which means if you are running security for a large bank, you probably manage budgets of hundreds of millions of dollars. And if you claim that is one thing that's inflicting a lot of pain you, you worry about that. You think that your bank is at risk and you haven't done anything about it, probably not as important as you claim. So you probably have done something. You've downloaded an open source package to write out. You put two consultants to develop a temporary solution. You had real conversation with Palo Alto Networks or WEEZ to see if they can solve that issue for you. You've done something. So we are asking them not about their opinions, but what they actually did to try and deal with that pain point. Eventually, we reverse the power balance in the conversation because we are not asking for favors. We are telling those organizations, hey, this is a new CyberStarts team. That new team would spend about $100 million in the next three years on engineering alone to build one solution. That's the average for a cyberstats company, $100 million R&D budget for three years. What is the one thing that you care about that you'd like us to solve with our $100 million? You don't need to spend anything on that. We are giving you essentially $100 million off balance sheet to solve one pain point for your organization. And I found out that when you give people $100 million virtually, they listen and they think. And then you take those answers and you're not having one conversation or two conversations. I think that to have a statistically meaningful outcome, you need to talk to dozens of organizations. You speak with dozens of organizations and you make a choice. This is the one pain point I'm going to go after. And then you do another round of conversations, assuming you go after that pain point and ask them questions, how a solution would look like, because you really like the solution to Be loved by the users. And only then, and sometimes it takes six months, only then you start to build software. And if you think about the typical startup, when they get money from VCs, they start to get pressure build software and push forward and hire people. And my approach is almost the opposite. Sit tight, don't get too excited. This is your last chance to pick the right problem to go after. So let's make sure we pick right. The outcome is that they build software that solves a major pain point. It's verified with dozens of real customers, and they've built a solution that people would love because they talked to those people before they started to build code. Now, it doesn't work every team, but as I think I've demonstrated, the success rate is quite high.

  If I back up now and think about the process so far, it's the identification of these people that have this super resilience history and gene. It's the application of the Sunrise program to start identifying and then ultimately pick a problem that's super valuable using these unique set of questions. What's the next phase? Are these things built in a distinctive way relative to the normal startup that you've observed before? Or is it at that point a standard software building exercise?
  Gili Raanan
  It's a standard software building exercise, but perfectly done because you start on the end and walk backwards. It starts with the end in terms of value, what value the customer would like to produce with that piece of software. The silence process doesn't end at six months. It's a full simulation of everything you're going to face in the next three or four years as a founder, as a company, and how do you deal with it? And how do you architect your company in the best way to run as fast as feasible in the first three or four years? So if you demo the product and then they didn't take you for product evaluation, why is that? If I tell you, the man from the future tells you that they evaluated the product and didn't buy it, why is that? We use a lot of simulations that assume failure and forces the founders to really analyze the situation, assuming a failure, and build their company to deal with it. So it's not just about product. It's about go-to team. It's about pricing. It's about channel strategy. It's about maybe location of headquarters. Those are many, many elements that are being evaluated, examined during the time of the sunrise. ([TimeÂ 0:26:13](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a0470eb7-71f1-4ff6-a232-5ae97a6c4595))
