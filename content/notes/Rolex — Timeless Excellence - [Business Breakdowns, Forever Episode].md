### Highlights

- A Level Set on Rolex: Size and Structure
  Summary:
  "I think we're certainly shocking to me, and I think we'll shock some people, too," he says. "We have a good idea of what they might produce and what the revenue might be." Rolex doesn't communicate any information about its future plans or business model in this interview; it's all speculative.

  Speaker 2
  If you speak to them directly, they'll credit with that period as the turning point for them in the US. Before we go into the history, which is so interesting and really important, we could just do a level set for the audience on Rolex, the business, and just some basics. How many watches do they produce a year, the revenue that they produce a year? Maybe say a little bit about their very unique business structure. I think we're certainly shocking to me, and I think we'll shock some people, too, that aren't familiar with it. Just level set us on the size and type of the Rolex as a business.
  Speaker 1
  I want to be completely clear, and I'm sure Rolex will listen to this, so I want to be clear for that and for the audience, is that they don't communicate any. This is all speculative. The information that I'll provide and that I'm sure you've read is completely speculative. We have a good idea of what they might produce and what the revenue might be.

    - **Note:** Rolex increased marketing in 08-09 which cemented them as a luxury brand when the competition pulled back.
- Revealing Rolex's Secretive Manufacturing Techniques
  Summary:
  The luxury world is so much about Instagram and influencers. And Rolex is just quietly the most prestigious. They are so kind of conservative and thoughtful in the way that they communicate. I cannot think of another example of a company that I want to come to when it comes to vertical integration and quality.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And the only reason that I found out is when doing research for that story, I spoke to an independent watchmaker who was in New York City and is one of the best watchmakers in the country, if not the world. And he said he works on Rolex as well as other brands. These are the changes that they made to their movements without anybody knowing. And by the way, these other brands that are communicating about Lega, which is a manufacturing technique that allows you to have frictionless gears, a brand sent out of press release about that. And then he came to find out that Rolex had been doing that for five years. It was in half their watches. That's what's so kind of wonderful about Rolex is they just are so remarkably Swiss. They are so kind of conservative and thoughtful in the way that they communicate. And I wrote that story in 2015. I was one of the first journalists to ever be invited inside Rolex manufacturing headquarters in the end. And I was like, I'm not sure what movements are made, they just are not out there to talk about themselves really ever. And it's incredibly charming. The luxury world is so much about Instagram and influencers and people counting how prestigious any brand might be. And Rolex is just quietly the most prestigious.
  Speaker 2
  It is so ridiculously singular. I cannot think of another example of a company that I want to come to vertical integration and quality and some of these key brand elements and real elements of a Rolex in the absence of a profit motive over such a long period of time, there are just other stories like this where there are such dominance. ([Time 0:17:57](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a0f56529-4464-49ae-ba31-2b1f515ac9f4))
    - **Note:** Rolex is a Non profit that is so focused on quality and does it in a reserved way where they’ll update a key watch costing thousands and not tell anyone or flaunt it.
- The history of Rolex: the Oyster case and early marketing
  Summary:
  Omega had something that was pretty close and actually predates the Oyster case, but never really took off in the same way. Instead of using seals, it was almost like a locking system didn't really take off. But effectively, there was this woman named Mercedes Gleetz who was a typist of all things, basically a secretary in the UK. And she attempted to swim the English channel. She failed, but nobody really cared because she'd already done it before. So he took out and had celebrating the fact that this watch was around this woman's neck for 10 hours in the English channel  and the timekeeping was flawless.

  Nobody was doing it at the time. Omega had something that was pretty close and actually predates the Oyster case, but never really took off in the same way. Instead of using seals, it was almost like a locking system didn't really take off. But effectively, there was this woman named Mercedes Gleetz, who was a typist of all things, basically a secretary in the UK. And she had swum the English channel successfully, the first woman to swum the English channel successfully. And Hans Wollzdorf, the founder said, Hey, wouldn't it be cool if, you know, you know, this woman, A, she's a woman, B, she's doing this amazing feat that no one had ever done before. Wouldn't it be cool if she wore the watch around her neck? So she didn't wear an honor wrist because she put her around her neck. And she attempted to swim the English channel. She actually didn't successfully do it. She failed, but nobody really cared because she'd already done it before. And so he took out and had celebrating the fact that this watch was around this woman's neck for 10 hours in the English channel and the timekeeping was flawless. And so that kind of solidified Rolex as a household name because the Oyster case had been validated in the English channel with this early brand ambassador, I guess you would call her. That was a huge deal. And I think one of the earliest examples of real marketing by any luxury brand or any brand really at all. And then the final 10 it would be self-winding, which is I would equate it to like the automatic transmission. When the automatic transmission came around, all of a sudden driving a car became a hell of a lot easier. You just became wider, accepted, et cetera. ([Time 0:24:17](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2fd2b987-947e-4a24-b34b-b6791d453260))
    - **Note:** Rolex did a ton of early marketing around how high quality it was. They were a super high quality and performance watch the best on the market
- Rolex's Journey Through Tough Times to In-House Production
  Summary:
  Rishmont owns a bunch of the great ones, including Vacheron and swatch. Rolex to me, the kind of secret sauce is equal parts case, equal parts movement. There are four different production facilities, two in Geneva,. one in Tom the Wott, which is a little bit outside. And then there's one in Shenandoah, which does dials in."
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  70s and 80s opulence, you understand what the 80s were, of course, it just changed what Rolex was. But by the way, it worked and it allowed them to continue to be relevant when everybody else being Omega and to a degree Vacheron, like these things really struggled. And that is why so many of them ended up in conglomerates in the 80s and 90s when watches were mechanical watch super really not doing so hot. A lot of folks came in and bundled them all up. So Rishmont owns a bunch of the great ones, including Vacheron, swatch owns everything from swatch to Blanc-Pombre, gay Omega. It was a time of great challenge for sure. And Rolex, they struggled as well, never to the degree that the others did, but it was not great for them. And then the 90s started to come around and Rolex had a CEO by the name of Patrick Heinegger, his father was actually also a CEO of the idea of how things work at Rolex. And he said, I want to take Rolex in-house. And he was really the first to do frankly well before a protector, well before anybody else. And so Rolex was using 27 different suppliers to make safe American. And after he was done with it, they're using four. And now those four are completely owned by Rolex. There are four different production facilities, two in Geneva, one in what I would call proper Geneva one in Tom the Wott, which is a little bit outside. And then there's one in Shenandoah, which does dials in, there's one in PL, which makes the movements. But what's so amazing is Rolex to me, the kind of secret sauce is equal parts case, equal parts movement. ([Time 0:31:01](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8a08f3c9-f0e2-48d9-bfdb-798887deca59))
    - **Note:** When other watch makers were struggling and compromising with the quartz revolution Rolex focused on going up in quality and decided to in-house a lot of their designs. They controlled the process like no other maker and we’re the first to in house work with wrist watches constantly innovating.
- Inside the Manufacturing of Rolex Watches
  Summary:
  The innovation done by Rolex is just above and beyond anything I've seen. One of their facilities, they actually have more than two Nobel Prize winning scientists on staff working on watches. Even the steel on Rolex is proprietary and it's made by Rolex. It's 904L. It's wine. They make their own gold called Everose and it's rose gold. Just remarkable.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  As I wrote in that story, I was among the first to be invited inside the movement manufacturing, which is really the source of the IP. Like that is where this also just made so-to-speak. Just remarkable. If you haven't read the story, it's on Hoding Key. It's called Inside the Manufacturer visiting all four Rolex locations. It was remarkable. As I started out in that story, I was a, you know, this was 10 years ago or 7 years ago, I was a lover of watches, I was a lover of Rolex and I had more Rolexes then than had anything else at that point. None of them were as old as I was. They were all considerably older than me. And it's funny, I reread the story to kind of prepare for this every year. And now since then, I've bought more modern Rolexes than I have vintage. And the world is just a different place. But once you see everything that Rolex does to a watch, and what I mean by that is the fact that they have their own foundry, even the steel, not just the gold and precious metals, even the steel on Rolex is proprietary and it's made by Rolex. It's 904L. It's wine. They make their own gold. It's called Everose and it's rose gold. It's just remarkable. And what I think is even more telling of what Rolex is about is that one of their facilities, they actually have, and I mean this literally, more than two Nobel Prize winning scientists on staff working on watches. Think about what that must mean from material science perspective. The innovation done by Rolex is just above and beyond anything I've seen. I've been to every watchmaker and I've been to several car manufacturers doing this. I've been all over. ([Time 0:33:27](https://share.snipd.com/snip/de4d9d56-97a2-49ec-a9e8-a92fde18d43a))
    - **Note:** Rolex makes their own steel and gold has 2 Nobel prize winning scientists employed no one has their quality.
- Rolex's Long-Term Brand Ambassadors
  Summary:
  Rolex has worked with Jack Nickliz since 1967. They really are committed to long-term meaningful relationships, much more so than any other brand. It's not like with some of these luxury brands or car companies where the new CEO gets let go and I believe in sailing and motorsports. There are core tenets of Rolex. Motorsports is in fact one of them.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I'm trying to think of an example. I'll say Leonardo DiCaprio. He's been an ambassador for Tag Oyer. He's been a BAFTA at the Pride of BC. He is a hyper-famous, hyper-talented person. He doesn't care. It's just money for him, etc. The contracts he's had with Tag Oyer probably lasted five years. Rolex has worked with Jack Nickliz since 1967. 1967. They worked with him till this day. He's still very much alive and he's had a bunch of Rolexes. We did a video with him. But think about that deal. 1967 to 2022. It's just wild. Omega does that to a degree. They've had a partnership with Cindy Crawford since the early 90s and Al-Qaeda. It's not an official ambassador ship. Rolex takes it to the next level. They've been with Roger for his entire career. They really are committed to long-term meaningful relationships, much more so than any other brand. It's not like with some of these luxury brands or car companies where, okay, new CEO, I believe in tennis and a question. Then he gets let go and the new guy comes in and I believe in sailing and motorsports. It's not like that at all. There are core tenets of Rolex. Motorsports is in fact one of them. And that's it. They're not playing in the NBA. They're not sponsoring baseball. They're not sponsoring the NFL. They're doing the things that they do, which is equestrian. Sailing to a degree. It's motorsports tennis and golf. It's just amazing that these strategies continue to deliver decade after decade. What was golf in 1967? ([Time 0:40:47](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d8b54723-c1bb-4b69-b2a7-078a4dfede82))
    - **Note:** Very long term thinking they only sponsor the best and only in a select group of their sports. They sponsored jack nickleson since 1967 and still sponsor him today likewise with Roger Federer
- Impact of Apple Watch on Luxury Watch Market and Business Breakdown of Watch Brands
  Summary:
  The market between $500 and sub-5,000 has just been destroyed. The brands like Shynola and Fossil were a multi-multibillion dollar company. Now you want a Rolex or Mega Tag Heuer or above or nothing. I think Apple Watch was a big, big player.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  A luxury watch, pre-Apple watch, I would consider $1,000 and above, maybe even $500 and above. It has decimated that market. So the market between $500 and sub $5,000 has just been destroyed. The brands like Shynola and Fossil. Fossil was a multi-multibillion dollar company. I'm just enormous. I don't know that name anymore. Exactly. The price in 2013, pre-Apple Watch was $80 a share, but last time I checked it was $8, probably even lower than that now. They've lost 90% of their market. Apple Watch has in some ways helped the Rolexes and the Omega's in the world because Rolex and Omega and Tag Heuer are like, they are luxury to most people. They're clearly expensive. They start around $5,000 instead of around one, like some of the other folks do. That's like the baseline now. Now you want a Rolex or Mega Tag Heuer or above or nothing. You don't want the Shynola anymore. You don't want the Fossil anymore. I think Apple Watch was a big, big player.
  Speaker 2
  Maybe say a bit. Obviously, we don't have the data on Rolex specifically, but just from what you know about the watch industry about the income statement of a watch brand. Are they very high gross margin like a lot of luxury products? They are. How are they typically distributed? Anything interesting there that you think maps back on to Rolex, this is business breakdown. It's not just product breakdowns, although here are the products. It's way more interesting. Anything worth mentioning there just in how the business itself works that's unique? ([Time 0:46:42](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8ba79a08-e54a-4d4f-af1d-fe35cb9597bc))
    - **Note:** Rolex does what makes their beer taste better they don’t have retail store they just make watches. They think long term and have a strong continuity of design that many other players don’t have.
