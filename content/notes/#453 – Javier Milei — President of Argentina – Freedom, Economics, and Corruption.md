### Highlights

- From Idealism to Pragmatism in Economics
  Summary:
  The philosophy of economics has evolved from a strong idealistic position of anarcho-capitalism, which emphasizes the non-aggression principle and the right to life, liberty, and property, to a more pragmatic stance of minarchism in practice.
  This transition reflects the recognition of real-world constraints that limit the implementation of ideal conditions. Currently advocating for minimal state intervention, significant structural reforms are being initiated to reduce regulations and improve freedoms, drawing parallels to historical economic transformations, such as Ireland's dramatic growth following market reforms.
  The journey is characterized by a continuous effort to shift towards a freer society, despite facing criticism for holding an idealistic vision.
  Adaptability is crucial; while some conditions can be immediately changed, others require a longer-term approach.
  The focus remains on both advancing towards the ideal of anarcho-capitalism while effectively utilizing the existing conditions to implement necessary reforms.

  So from that, what is now today, and maybe you can talk about the evolution, is your philosophy, economics philosophy. You've described yourself as an anarcho-capitalist, market anarchist, libertarian. That's the ideal. And then maybe in practice and reality, you've said that you're more of a minarchist. So lay it all out. What's your economics philosophy today? Strictly speaking, I am an anarcho-capitalist.
  Speaker 1
  I despise the state government. I despise violence. Let us suppose we take the definition of liberalism. I usually use the definition of liberalism given by Alberto Venegas Lynchijo, which is very much in line with the definition of John Locke, which essentially matches the definition By Alberto Venegas Lynch Jr., who said that liberalism is the unrestricted respect for the life project of others based on the principle of non-aggression and in defense of the right To life, liberty, and property. So I frame all of the discussions within those terms. And the fact is that when you get to that notion, I would dare say that you become an anarcho-capitalist de facto. And what that describes, it is an idea which represents my ideal world. I mean, that is the ideal world. Now, real life poses a whole lot of restraints. And some of those you can lift, and those restrictions and others you can't. So, in real life, I am a minarchist. I advocate for minimizing state size. I try to remove as many regulations as possible. In fact, that is what I used to say during my campaign. And let's say that is what I'm now carrying out. We have just carried out the largest structural reform in Argentine history. It is a structural reform that is eight times larger than Menem's, which had been the largest structural reform in history. And we did that with 15% of the representatives and 10% of the senators. Furthermore, we have a deregulation ministry where basically every day we eliminate between one and five regulations. On the other hand, we have 3,200 additional structural reforms pending to the point that the day we finish all these reforms, we will be the freest country on the planet with the consequences They have in terms of well-being. Think about this. When Ireland started market reforms just over 40 years ago, it was the poorest country in Europe. Today, its GDP per capita is 50% higher than that of the United States. So, I have a current situation, and what I am constantly looking for, whether from my academic works and my outreach notes and books, is the world we have today. That every day we are closer, that every day we gain more freedom because there are some very interesting things here. First, I would like quote Milton Friedman. There is a moment when they do an interview with Milton Friedman and they ask him about liberals. And then he says that there are three types of liberals. There are the classical liberals, where, for example, Adam Smith or Milton Friedman himself could fit. Some say that Hayek could fit into that category. For me, Hayek is a minarchist. Then you have the minarchist where you could clearly find in that place Mises Hayek. One could find in philosophical terms Nozick and basically Ayn Rand. And at one point, Milton Friedman, based on his own son, he says, but if you look closely, there are some who are anarchists. Let's say, probably from my point of view, the person who has been the greatest inspiration in my life is essentially Murray Newton Rothbard. So therefore, there are two dimensions. One is where I want to go. And the topic is where I stand. So the most important thing is to try each day to advance further toward that ideal of anarcho-capitalism. In that sense, sometimes we face strong and harsh criticism regarding that ideal vision. I think that's the Nirvana fallacy. If you compare yourself against paradise, everything is horrible and miserable, but you don't live in paradise. You live on earth. Basically, what you need to understand is something called the state conditions. Let's suppose that you don't like rectangular tables. You prefer circular tables. Now, the reality is I have only a few hours until I go and catch my flight. And the table is rectangular. You like a circular table, a round one, but there isn't one. What you have is a rectangular table. So either we do the interview here or we just can't do it. So what do you do? You adapt the current conditions. This is what there is. Now, so then you have some restrictions that you can change and others that you cannot. The idea is to modify all the ones that can be changed in the short term and start working on those that can be modified in the medium or long term. For example, if you really like roundtables, perhaps the next interview we may do at a roundtable. We're going to try and solve it. But today it's something that we couldn't possibly solve.
