### Highlights

- The Impact of Reality: A Lion's Lesson
  Key takeaways:
  - Speed of reality and impact are important considerations.
  - In Africa, animals face reality quickly and consistently.
  - Not facing reality can have dire consequences, such as death.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  One of the things that I think about is sort of the speed of reality, how quickly does reality hit you? And what is the impact of reality? Every morning in Africa, lion wakes up and knows if he doesn't outrun the slowest gazelle, he's gonna starve. So he wakes up running. Reality hits very fast every minute of every day and the cost of not facing reality is death. Obviously that's not quite the same for ([Time 0:00:00](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a61c4dc6-aeb0-46c9-a2f3-507a9649c2f9))
- Having a Work Personality and a Home Personality: The Downside
  Key takeaways:
  - Avoid having a work personality and a home personality to prevent burnout
  - Being consistent across work and home life helps to avoid living two different lives
  - Working with people who act differently at work and at home can be surprising
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I don't know if it's the best advice I've ever received, but it's the advice that comes to mind when you say it. And it's from my dad right when I first started working. And he said, listen son, don't have a work personality and a home personality. It'll just tire you out and you don't want to have to live two different lives. And I'm sure there are way better versions of advice from when I was a kid or any of that around integrity and all that. But the piece of advice that just came to mind when you asked was that one.
  Speaker 2
  Have you worked with people who seem like two different people? One person at work and one person outside of work? Yes.
  Speaker 1
  The first thing is you're surprised when you see them in the home environment. Because you have this vision of the way they are and then you see them in a different environment. ([Time 0:03:37](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d8e8c759-1116-4aae-87e4-d87fd8b3ac5c))
    - **Note:** Don’t have a work and home personality. People want to get the real person not the pieces of your personality you subjugate to different areas of your life.
- Sibling Differences in Work Ethic and Interests Influences Life Choices
  Key takeaways:
  - The speaker's brother has a strong work ethic and excelled in areas that came easy to him
  - The speaker intentionally pursued different interests than their brother
  - The speaker's parents have a clear message about what success looks like and this has influenced the speaker's upbringing and teenage years.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Both. I think my brother has an extremely, he has a wonderful work ethic. But he also, you know, it did come easy to him on some things. And then I realized to your point, I tried to spend time on things that were different than what he did. So he liked baseball. He liked lacrosse. I didn't play baseball or lacrosse. I played basketball. He really was deeply studious and was into premed. And I was like, I'm definitely not going to be a doctor. He went to college at Northwestern, which is close to where we're from. And I said, I can't, I can't go to Northwestern. So there was a lot of that where a lot of my decisions almost felt like they were a record. I felt like they were a response to his. The other thing is my parents are from India. And I think that they have a very strong sense of what success looks like. And I'm very close to my parents, but that also informed my teenagers for sure because, you know, there was a very clear message from them around like, look, you got to, you got to get after it. There's laziness was like a huge ding in our household. It was just so offensive, you know, to be lazy. ([Time 0:06:18](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f5427e0f-d0ba-4983-92c6-fdee0480cffc))
- On belief, success, and parenting
  Key takeaways:
  - Children of immigrants often have parents with a strong focus on traditional success
  - Broader definitions of success exist
  - Earned success is key to happiness according to Arthur Brooks
  - Encourage kids to feel good at what they do and earn some level of success
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Certainly somewhat. I think for Avni and me, both of us had parents that were pretty, you know, had an opinion on the value of trying to be traditionally successful, whatever. Which I think is very typical for children of immigrants. I think we probably have a slightly different view than them on that of, you know, there are probably a broader definition of things of success than what they had. But I think we both do believe that we want our kids to be happy and we think, and I certainly think that like earned success is the key to happiness. I really believe that I heard this one time from Arthur Brooks, who used to run the American Enterprise Institute is really sat with me. It is something I believe a lot. And so a lot of what we try to get into our kids is this belief of whatever you do. Just make sure you feel like you're good at it and make sure that you feel like you've earned some level of success in it. ([Time 0:07:38](https://share.snipd.com/snip/cfe286bd-37d7-4dfb-9141-338dad31738a))
    - **Note:** Parents were immigrants earned success is the key to happiness
- Against complain and being a victim as well as laziness. We have agency we are the captain
  Key takeaways:
  - Laziness and whining are triggers for the speakers with their kids
  - Whining triggers the speaker due to their dislike of whiny adults and victims
  - The speaker wants their kids to take control of their own lives and not develop a victim mentality
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  The other thing I sort of wanted to go back to is laziness. It's like such a trigger for me with my kids. I don't know why, but any hint of laziness I'm just like all over.
  Speaker 1
  Mine, mine is a windiness. Any whining drives me nuts. And it is because I thought about this a lot. It's a huge trigger where I am irrational in my response to it. And, but the reason I think I am is I just I really dislike whiny adults. I really dislike people that are victims. And I really have a hard time with it. And I have this thing that I just want to make sure that my kids are not like that. And so I'm sure that I'm not doing it right, but it is such a triggering thing for me when there's whining or feeling like, Oh, this happened to me and kind of their life happens to them versus like, no, you know, it's not a mistakes were made situation. It's not like, gosh, there was nothing I could do. No, we can always do something. We have agency. We are the captains of our own ship. And so I was joking with my wife that like if they're, you know, in therapy when they're older and they're telling their therapist about. What their parents did. One of the things is certain like, man, I couldn't even complain about anything. But that's my trigger.
  Speaker 2
  How do you talk to them in that moment? Your kids are three, right? Three boys. ([Time 0:09:59](https://share.snipd.com/snip/635b6bba-b964-449f-bf50-4fe0392554f5))
- You can’t learn lessons for someone else. Ask questions have them get to their answer. 
  Key takeaways:
  - Asking kids questions during difficult situations is better than just reacting
  - Children are good at answering questions and can give surprising answers
  - Getting them to talk and come to their own conclusions is more effective than telling them what to do
  - Children have to believe and understand a lesson in order to learn from it
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And I just kind of react. You know, so hopefully that doesn't happen a lot, but that's definitely one version of it. You know, stop whining that one. I think the one that is much better is sort of asking them questions. Hey, what happened here? Hey, why are you? Why do you sound like that? What is the thing that actually went on? Do you think you could have done anything differently? And I think that kids, they are good at answering questions and they give you surprising answers sometimes. And what we find is if you just get them talking, it's generally much better. And the questions generally help with that. And so I'd say when I met my best or when we're at our best in that situation, it's much more asking them about what they think and trying to get them to get there themselves because it's the same thing, right? They have to believe it. You know, my parents have this thing if you can't learn someone else's lessons for them. And I think that applies a lot, right? I think about that. Like they have to believe it. They have to get there. And I'll give you an example that's a little bit broader, but it's a moment that I was pretty proud of. ([Time 0:11:46](https://share.snipd.com/snip/efc5367a-7c2c-4c84-852a-3d1066154e68))
    - **Note:** You can’t learn lessons for someone else. Ask questions have them get to their answer. Have them earn the medal don’t give it to them because then they won’t internalize it.
- The Mistake of Equality and the Importance of Challenging Talent
  Key takeaways:
  - Equality can sometimes result in mistreatment of those who are better at something
  - Everyone deserves a chance to be challenged and learn
  - Mistreating someone with natural talent or who worked hard is not representative of equality
  - The world will ultimately decide if someone is good enough for a given task
  - The bar for success cannot be faked
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Well, I think it's also, to your point, Shane, even when people say equality, it really is mistreating the kid that's better at something. Why do they not get to be challenged? If you really think about it, why do they not get to enjoy school anymore? Why do they not get to feel like they're learning something? And I think that you want to give everyone a chance. For sure, we are products of people being given a chance. But you can't mistreat somebody who either has worked hard or has natural talent. And I just don't think that that represents it. I think that we've talked about companies, all that. That happens in companies too. And it also is dishonest to the person. Because at some point, you're going to have to pay the piper. At some point, the world will decide whether you are good enough for the thing the world is asking you to do. Whatever it is, no one's going to listen to your podcast if it's not good. So at some point, the bar becomes the absolute bar. You can't fake it.
  Speaker 2
  I want to come back to the bar for a second. What seems to be happening is we just kick that can. It's like, yeah, we all know, intuitively, we have to have this conversation and that there's a reckoning, a moment when reality meets the situation. ([Time 0:16:42](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1e088e73-1199-44e3-b146-d4248de62417))
    - **Note:** At some point the bill comes due on quality and not giving people a shot in gifted programs may reduce equality to a challenging education
- Writing advice: Embrace the difficulty and write about what you care about
  Key takeaways:
  - Great writers write every day even if it's difficult for them
  - Choose topics that you actually care about instead of writing what you think someone else will find interesting
  - The best writers do multiple drafts and versions before producing great content
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I was almost scared to write for a while because I assumed that it was hard for me and easy for everyone else. And therefore, I just wasn't very good at it. And the logic, even as I say it out loud, is pretty dumb. But a lot of what I've heard is just sort of embrace the fact that it's difficult. It's difficult for everyone. Even the best writers don't, it doesn't just come out. They just do so many drafts. They do so many versions. And they just kind of hammer it every day. I'm sure you've heard the Stone Cudders Kritow of pounding the rock. A lot of what I think great writers do is they just sit down and they write every day over and over and over again. I think another thing that I have found that has been good advice for me is choose the topics that you actually care about. Don't try to write about what you think someone else will think is interesting. Write about something that you actually care about. And it'll either be interesting or it won't, but at least you'll find that you want to write about it. Find the thing that you're compelled to write about. And so I think that was good advice. And then the last one that actually is one that I've taken very seriously is, if something comes to mind, you want to write, stop what you're doing and go right. Don't get out of the meeting. Go and sit down, write it down. Write it down, write it down. One of the things that I wrote that I'm most proud of is actually it didn't get a lot of attention or anything like that. But, and it shouldn't have because it's a very niche thing. But I wrote it on my notes section on my phone in the airport. But I felt something. And so I just started, I wrote the whole thing on my notes section. And that was cool. Otherwise I would have been like, oh, I just put the thought in my head and then I would have never written it otherwise. ([Time 0:33:22](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8d606f38-557f-41a7-9f57-c02be58395ea))
    - **Note:** Writing shapes your thinking and when you’re in the mood or have an idea drop everything have and start writing it’s supposed to be hard.
- Balancing company needs and personal interests in decision making
  Key takeaways:
  - Having a climate program may not be the right answer for every company
  - It can be easy to compromise on values in order to feel good or to please others
  - Staying committed to values requires constant effort and vigilance
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And you want to tell people, like it will help with recruiting some great engineers if we are really forward thinking on climate, right? And so you can talk yourself into it, well, it will help us if we have the best people in the world and the best people in the world sometimes care about these things. And gosh, like maybe we should have a climate program. But we shouldn't have. That was not the right answer for the company at that time. And I think that, so it's at risk at breaking because it's also easy to say, yes, people feel good. You feel like you're listening. A lot of times it can feel like you're being obstinate when you're not, when you, you know, it just feels easy to make that little compromise. And then the same thing, it's at risk of breaking all the time, you know, I'll get invited to an interesting dinner, I'll get invited to an interesting thing that, you know, is away from home. And it's just like, oh, just one night, you know, that's okay, you know, it's 364 other nights. But so I'd say I find it to be a constant battle, but it is something I take pride in and that I think that I am, I think it's like in my soul. It's something I really believe. ([Time 1:07:17](https://share.snipd.com/snip/137feae5-b6fc-411a-bffd-df0287136051))
    - **Note:** Keep the main thing the main thing. When you’re running out of cash 12 months of runway you’re not focused on what you could be doing to combat climate change. Focus and understand the most important things and prioritize them with your time or change your priorities.
- Resourcefulness as a key trait: Breaking out of a third world prison
  Key takeaways:
  - Resourcefulness is an important quality to have in problem-solving.
  - Being able to think through problems never encountered before is a valuable skill.
  - Simple and effective solutions should be considered and are often overlooked.
  - There are no points for degree of difficulty in problem-solving.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  I love it. What you're really trying to do is, we used to ask this at the intelligence agency in some of our interviews, which is like, we're gonna use a different question than we use, but how would you break me out of a third world prison? Yeah, yeah. Right, which is what we're really trying to figure out is, are you resourceful? Totally. Right? How do you think through problems that you've never encountered, not know a way of like, how do you move Mount Fuji? Because I think those are easy to prepare for, but this is like, how would you actually do this? How would you fix this problem? Well, I'd buy a Fritt. That's a simple answer that's effective and worked. That's amazing. But it's surprising that that answer is not the standard.
  Speaker 1
  I know, and to your point, yeah, like, I always, one of the things I tell people who I work with, you know, I'm like, guys, this is not gymnastics. There's no points for degree of difficulty. Let's just go, let's just get to the right answer. Let's go, if it's hard, it's hard, cool, but sometimes it's not hard. Let's just do the thing.
  Speaker 3
  Well, that's easy.
  Speaker 2
  Actually, it's interesting you mentioned that you said that there's no points for degree of difficulty. One of the things that I've been playing around with in my head lately ([Time 1:14:14](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f1908117-e08d-45b4-9fdb-e40afdd244f9))
    - **Note:** Fix the fright there are no extra points for degree of difficulty. Position yourself well and make the easiest obvious decision. You don’t need new processes and new systems you just need to solve the most urgent problems.
- The Importance of Position in Decision Making
  Key takeaways:
  - Exceptional decision makers find themselves in consistently good positions where all of their options are good.
  - Good decision makers are adept at identifying one-way doors versus two-way doors.
  - For one-way doors, speed is the most important metric for making a decision.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Actually, it's interesting you mentioned that you said that there's no points for degree of difficulty. One of the things that I've been playing around with in my head lately is that most of the people that I think of as exceptional decision makers, consistently good decisions, find themselves in consistently good positions. And when you're in a consistently good position, all of your options basically are good. You're never forced into a bad decision. And when you're in a bad position, there's like one Hail Mary that might get you out, but everything else is just gonna go from bad to worse.
  Speaker 1
  I think that it is generally true. And my, look, I mean, you have a lot more experience, actually, than I do in thinking through this and talking to people. So the reason that I find myself largely agreeing is I think the really good decision maker is what they do is they're very good at identifying the one way doors versus the two way doors, right? And on the one way doors, their metric is speed. And they're sort of like, I need the feedback as soon as possible, on the two way doors, their feedback mechanism is just like, I gotta optimize for speed. I gotta make this one quickly. I don't care if it's wrong, if it's wrong, we'll fix it. One of my big things is you can bounce back from any mistake other than a mistake of integrity. If you don't make a mistake of integrity, you can really actually just like fix almost anything, right? And then I think those same decision makers on the one way doors, they're super thoughtful and they get them right. ([Time 1:15:20](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7e7d7336-efcc-48d1-957b-4df691b49e5d))
    - **Note:** Decision making 1 vs 2 way doors. Matrix of important and reversible.
- Max Rhodes: A Good Decision Maker
  Key takeaways:
  - Good decision makers ask specific questions to the right people.
  - They prioritize feedback based on topic and expertise.
  - Thoughtful labeling of council and awareness during decision making are important.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And I'll give you an example of someone I work with who I think is a very good decision maker. Max Rhodes is the CEO and co-founder affair, this B2B wholesale marketplace that we're involved with. Max is extremely good at asking each of his board members or advisors a specific question that he thinks they will be useful on. He doesn't ask the whole board when he's making certain decisions. He goes and decides who is the right person to go ask. He goes and spends real time with them on that. And even in the board meeting, he's thoughtful about the order in which he asks for people's feedback, right? Because he's like, look, on this topic, this person is the one who I want to hear the most on, whereas on this one, somebody else might be the topic. And he's not worried if it's been three questions and he hasn't asked somebody something. You're on the board, you obviously are somebody, he was opinion, he values, cool. So that's another one I think. They're very thoughtful about whose council they keep. I think the third one is they are aware of when they're decision making, they're aware of concepts like decision fatigue and they work around it, right? So they say, okay, look, I'm sure you've read the Bezos stuff. If Bezos's point was like, my job is to make two or three good decisions a day. Well, what that means is I should structure my entire day around making sure that I'm in the right state of mind to make those decisions. My meeting should be at a certain time. I think the point of this is they don't confuse activity with insight. They don't just go do stuff, right? They do things that they think will help them make the right decisions, you know? ([Time 1:20:28](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f1dd287a-8549-4094-ab6d-5eb013175b12))
    - **Note:** Don’t confuse activity with insight. Structure your day to be most productive. If you work best in the morning put the high delta things in the morning.
- Dimensions and Frameworks for Decision Making in Conversation
  Key takeaways:
  - Experts in a specific content area might know more than the speaker, so it's important to consider their perspective and use their expertise to inform decisions.
  - Using a framework to guide decision-making can be helpful in collaboration with experts.
  - When the speaker acknowledges their limitations and still advocates for something, it can earn them respect and attention from experts.
  - The word "velocity" was used instead of "speed" with a possible distinction being that velocity includes direction and speed does not.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And they actually might know a lot more than you specifically about the content. So I think a fair amount of the time, the answer when it comes to that is like, well, here are the things that I would be considering. Here are the dimensions that would inform my decision. But I actually know less about those dimensions than you do. So like the framework I'd use is this, if you use that framework, what would it come out with? Right? You're almost trying to help on that dimension. And then once a year, when you say, please, hear me, I think I know I don't know as much about this as you do. But I really still feel like this is something we should do. They pay attention, right? They don't always do it. But you've earned the right for them to listen because you don't say it all the time.
  Speaker 2
  One of the words you used there was, stood out to me as important, which was you used the word velocity and not speed. Why did you choose that word?
  Speaker 1
  I don't know if this is correct. I'm not a linguist. When I think of velocity, I think of throughput, I think of sort of this concept of it's almost like I'm training the machine to make decisions I want as much feedback as possible so that I can input that feedback back into the machine so that the next one's better. And so somehow it's like I want that machine turning as many times as possible. And I don't know if that's specifically like more correlated to velocity than speed, but the word that's in my head that keeps on coming to us through put, throughput, ([Time 1:32:26](https://share.snipd.com/snip/74d7c497-685a-42f9-842a-08b44cd0932a))
    - **Note:** Understand what’s important high velocity decisions when the outcome doesn’t matter.
- Common Ways Exceptional People Self-Sabotage
  Key takeaways:
  - One way that people self-sabotage is by thinking that their past knowledge is enough and they overly pattern match from the past, rather than treating the problem at hand like it deserves steady effort and attention.
  - Having a belief that something is beneath them or that past success will make a current task possible is another form of self-sabotage.
  - Management is a challenging task.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Let's switch gears a little bit here. You work with a lot of exceptional people. What are the ways, what are the common ways that you see them self-sabotage?
  Speaker 1
  So one, a very good friend of mine gave me a book called Ego is the Enemy. One way that folks self-sabotage is thinking your past knowledge is enough rather than treating the problem at hand like it's hard and deserves steady. I think a lot of times people overly pattern match from the past, particularly in an investing business. And they sort of think that they have the ability to be right because they were right before. And it's like, no, you got to go earn it each time. It's like thinking that because you were good at shooting threes in the past, you're going to be good at shooting threes today. It's like, no, you got to go do it today. It's not about what you did yesterday. And so I think that sort of having a belief that something is beneath them in the work or having a belief that the past success will make it possible, I think, is a self-sabotage. Management is really hard. ([Time 1:34:42](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4f42c8f0-0108-4a88-b2d0-26fb173f1444))
    - **Note:** Don’t rest on past success don’t choose to be loved more than respected. Never stop always improve and be a dog. Don’t optimize for happiness in the moment but success in the long term.
