- Summary: When writing in public, there is a common idea that you should make it accessible. This is a left over from mass media.

### Highlights

- The way the machine seemed to work was:
  1. The more precise and niche the words I input, the better the internet would match me with people I could forge meaningful relationships with. This precision was hard for me, partly because my sense for how communication is supposed to work is shaped by reading mass media. Writing for a general public, you need to be broad and a bit bland. I didn’t want a general public. I wanted a specific set of people, the people who could help me along as a human being obsessed with certain intellectual problems. I didn’t know who these people *were*. I only knew that they existed. Hence my writing was a search query. It needed to be phrased in such a way that it found these people and, if necessary, filtered others.
  2. The pleasant parts of the internet seemed to be curated by human beings, not algorithms. For my writing to find its way in this netherworld, I needed to have a rough sense of how information flowed down there. The pattern was this: words flowed from the periphery to the centers. This was a surprisingly rapid stream. Then the words cascaded from the center down in a broader but slower stream to the periphery again.

    - **Note:** how the internet works and matching niche people together
- It will seem like I am mainly talking about how to use writing to forge meaningful relationships. I think doing that is beautiful and important. But lurking behind it is a larger idea. Namely, that [you can shape yourself by reshaping your relationships](https://escapingflatland.substack.com/p/first-we-shape-our-social-graph-then). By changing who you are addressing, and the responses you garner, you steer your development. You [become more agentic](https://tomcritchlow.com/2022/08/29/blogging-agency/).

- Human brains are wired such that we get rewarded for attending to surprisal. If we turn our attention toward things that surprise us we get *excited*—and our model of the world changes. It grows more complex. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hffhh2sfbkp5d12jcy1cz207))
    - **Tags:** #novelty, #complexity
    - **Note:** humans enjoy novelty but as we learn more we need to look for novelty in the area of complexity as it is no longer inhabiting our day to day
- You can either be incomprehensible and see them grow concerned about things you are excited about, or you can talk about surface-level things and cry a little when you are alone at night. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hffhmrp365sqrjwq6hjgj41y))

    - **Note:** either stay surface level or talk about your interests. Reach a wide audience superficially or a deep one authentically but smaller. This is about choosing your customer and market.
- You ask yourself: What would have made me jump off my chair if I had read it six months ago (or a week ago, or however fast you write)? If you have figured out something that made you ecstatic, this is what you should write. And you do not dumb it down, because you were not stupid six months ago, you just knew less. You also write with as much useful detail and beauty as you can muster, because that is what you would have wanted. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hffhr1jmx1axcz374yqmcntt))
    - **Tags:** #customer-(understanding-who-they-are), #writing-advice, #niche
    - **Note:** don't dumb down or simplify your writing but write about what you are specifically interest in for a very niche audience. Write essays you love. A blog post is a query to reach your niche tribe
- If you follow the advice above, you will write essays that almost no one likes.
  Luckily, *almost no one* multiplied by the entire population of the internet is plenty if you can only find them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hffj274s5dzx9n2p0w0fe5ve))

    - **Note:** write for an audience of one the internet gives you leverage to find your niche
- Then a few accounts that were an order of magnitude larger still retweeted it, because they followed Stian and Tom and now saw it. And from there it rushed up the stream order. It only took an hour or two for the tweet to reach the largest accounts it would reach (Tiago Forte with 84k followers, who retweeted it, and Balaji Srinavasan with 681K, who routed it on through a like). But *the smaller accounts took much longer*. Information rushes up and then trickles down. The larger accounts are not larger without a reason, but, at least in part, because they spend more time routing information in the network!
