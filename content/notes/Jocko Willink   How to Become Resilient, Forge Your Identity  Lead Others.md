  And that's why trying to engage with people and trying to give people that superpower of the attachment where they can take a step back and say, you know what, you're right, man, that girl, she wasn't who I really thought she was. I should move on. Yes. But easier said than done. And that's one of the biggest challenges I think that we have as friends and in parents and teammates is helping people learn to detach, learn to see the bigger picture, learn to see that the problem that you have that your whole world is actually not that big of a deal. You know what I wrote? I've written a bunch of kids books. And one of the things that triggered me to write kids books is realizing that, you know, one day my daughter came home, it's my oldest daughter, and she came home from school. And she's like, I, she says, I'm stupid. What do you mean you're stupid? I'm stupid. I'm dumb. Why do you think that? No, whatever grade it is when you're supposed to know your time's tables. I don't know my time's tables. I said, Oh, well, how much have you studied? She kind of gave me the confused look. What do you mean studied? I said, have you studied yet? Have you made flashcards to learn them? And she didn't. She hadn't. She thought she should just know them from, you know, the teacher went over what they are. Now she should know them like some other kids in the class did. And, and so I'm sitting there going, Oh, yeah, cool. We'll just, you know, we'll make some flashcards and she made flashcards. She learned her time's tables in 45 minutes and we were good. But what struck me was to me, I was like, Oh, no big deal to her. It was her whole life. And then I got to see that with my other kids, you know, somebody said something to them in the recess yard. And I'm like, Oh, screw that kid. They don't know what they don't worry about them. But when you're, that's their whole world. And that unfortunately doesn't only apply to kids, it applies to adults as well. And they get this problem in their world that seems so insurmountable and so massive because that little ecosystem that they're stuck in is their world. And they run into this problem in that. And it's disruptive in that world. And they don't know how to get out of it. Now, I, I, I did a podcast talking about these ecosystems that people get into, right? And there's all these ecosystems, your ecosystem, we're, we're both in a shared ecosystem of podcasting. And we could be like, Oh my gosh, you know, Lex just came out with a new podcast. And it's been the biggest success. And what can I do to catch up with Lex? And, and all of a sudden I could get really, you could get really bothered by that and think, man, I'm a failure. Meanwhile, there's people that don't listen to podcasts. There's people that don't even know what a podcast is. And yet, it's our whole world. If we let it be, you're in the academic world. Hey, you go, you're a professor at Stanford, which is a big deal in that world. I know people that don't give a rat's ass. They couldn't, they don't know where Stanford is. I get that all the time.
  Speaker 2
  They don't know where Stanford is.
  Speaker 1
  It's no big deal in the SEAL teams. Same thing. Somebody has a problem in the SEAL teams. And they think this is the whole world. And I blew it. And, and now what are they going to do? When you're facing a significant problem in life, a relationship, a problem with a job, you got to remember that you're in one ecosystem. And if you step outside of that ecosystem, no one really cares. And you could go move into a whole different ecosystem and, and find happiness there. But at least utilize that to get out of that storm cloud that you're in. And you're going to find that there's plenty of light out there in the world, move towards that. And it's going to be a much better situation. ([Time 2:46:32](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a0892009-4e24-4550-afed-2956aebea2e1))
    - **Note:** You get stuck or caught in an ecosystem where you’re feeding your mind lies. You can believe that you need to step outside yourself and see the bigger picture. We live in ecosystem and we can have that fuck is over. You’re in one ecosystem no one outside that ecosystem really cares about your niche but you get out of your head it doesn’t matter.
