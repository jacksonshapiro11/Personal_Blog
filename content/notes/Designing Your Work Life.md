### Highlights

- When you want to quit don’t go cold turkey but get a better sense of the situation then work on a way of leaving gracefully. Touch base with your network before leaving create a reference manual for your job transition responsibilities this could take a year or two after deciding to quit but being intentional preserves important relationships. When finding a new job lean into an interesting conversation and hear about others life story develop relationships and evolve them don’t ask for a job up front. Ask how you would explore opportunities at a company not directly for a job.

- 4 ways to get unstuck 1 reframe and re inlist in your current situation by changing your why 2 remodel your current job 3 relocate into a new role that’s similar to what you do 4 reinvent create a whole new role completely clean slate career. Sometimes you can add things within your normal job that allow you to do more of what you like.

    - **Note:** When you’re stuck reframe your mindset, change your current job, change your environment, or change everything reinvent.
- There are power brokers in every job and to properly understand office politics you need to figure out who they are and how they exercise their power. There are people with influence and authoritarian people this is a matrix of power in work there are also people who have decision autonomy. Influence is the value + recognition in the organization. Some people have positions over power and no real power likewise people in non traditional roles of power have influence because they have the ear of power. When there is a company change there is a values crisis that emerges that needs to get sorted. When there is a power play or values crisis you need to stay in the loop but these are power games and you can get burnt sometimes you need to avoid the 3rd rail other times you need to navigate the power brokers. This is also a good time to grab power. Power is a 3D object with people being closer to the center of power and higher in the org it’s like a cone the most important is at the tip and you can be bottom middle or bottom outside. This is also dynamic so you need to produce and update structures to remain closer to the center constantly.

    - **Note:** Power in organizations is a 3D construct with people in both traditional places and non traditional areas wielding different amounts of power. Because power isn't fully lclear you need to understand the landscape take advantage when the power games are up for grabs because that gives you the greatest time to move up in uncertainty but the greatest risk. First understand the landscape then figure out how you want to navigate and do that
- You are the creative agent in your own life and it’s on you to find happiness within your life. You are the boss of you and to enjoy work more you need to change your experience and mindset towards work. Cultivate a growth vs fixed mindset. Learning vs results as the end goal of an experience. Fixed mindset can be a negative self talk scenario and notice when your fixed mindset kicks in and reframe it. Cultivate grit starts with doing something you’re inherently interested in practicing often creating a mission or purpose around it. Maintaining hope and optimism. Grit and a growth mindset are key to success and to maintain things we need to create an internal locus of control. In jobs optimize for autonomy which you can always create relatedness cultivating relationships and competence growing it and feeling confident in your skin. Passion is an emergent phenomenon and this arises in your career over time.

    - **Note:** cultivate grit and a growth mindset you are a creative agent in your life and it's on you to take agency develop a growth mindset and find happiness confidence grows with time. Process vs results. Optimize for autonomy passion is an emergent phenomena. Become mission driven keep faith. Passion is an emergent phenomena
- Burnout state of physical and emotional exhaustion that involves reduced accomplishment and loss of identity. Have you become cynical or overly critical do you drag yourself to work and struggle to get started is it disillusioning irritable and impatient not satisfied with achievements are you self medicating. Causes are lack of control unclear job expectations disfunctional workplace boss is a bully team is toxic. Mismatch in value. Poor job fit underwhelmed and bored or overwhelmed and too busy. Lack of social support at work and in life. If you’re overwhelmed try to figure out workarounds and prototype changes to make it more actionable also seek to understand the needs and sympathize with those in charge. You have more agency than you think. When you’re Overwhelmed sometimes you’re doing your life’s work and you just need to be happy and frame the problem correctly. Bad thoughts come but you can choose happiness and flip these thoughts more intentionally. You are the designer and you’re in control.

    - **Note:** Burnout is a state of full exhaustion as a result of unclear role, toxic culture, mismatch values, or no agency.
      When you're just normal struggling in a job gain more agency you have more agency than you think the world is malleable. Happiness is a choice when the storms come you choose how you view them.
- First you need to frame the problem deeply understand it and put it in a box then you need to step outside and transcend the box. Reframing the problem and finding the best problems to work on for you is vital. Find the most effective problem to work on then reframe it. Start with the minimum actionable problem to get the ball rolling some problems are too big or abstract to attack so break it down to an mvp see what you can attack then go after it. First frame the problem then strip out the fluf and reframe when you’re trying to get to the root of the problem. Reframe and prototype smaller problems trying and adjusting to see what works understand your blind spots and biases where the reality gap exists if you’re not getting feedback is there a personal root issue with how you work or is it the situation. Some problems are intractable the world isn’t tests and linear systems but nonlinear solutions. Couples with intractable problems figure out a way to work around their problems understanding that they can’t solve it so they work together to manage it for their combined benefit. Create the best doable option constraint optimization problem. Come up with the finite alternatives then decide. Sometimes a global max is too intractable and your return on time is too low that you need to satisfice and move on. You can’t always have a global truth and you need to accept that so it doesn’t paralyze you. Sometimes you need to think then you need to just act and make a choice. An anchor problem is when we lock into a solution that’s not possible and get stuck on something impossible leading to unhappiness anchor problems lead to the comfort in knowing you’ll fail instead of going through the tougher task of trying. Gravity problems your stuck in a situation it’s a circumstance not a problem that’s leaving you stuck. Like trying to make it rich in a job society doesn’t value is a gravity problem you can’t change how societies rewards different professions so you need to work a side job or reframe your idea of rich. Come up with prototypes and try to fix the problem. Be worthy of our problems.

    - **Note:** First you need to properly frame the problem and find the min actionable problem you can't cure cancer without first learning something about cancer and you need to learn something about cells before you understand cancer ect. Frame and reframe the problem try to optimize and get to the root cause. Create best doable option.
      We live in a non linear world with linear models. Sometimes a problem is intractable and you need a local not a global max. You need to recognize when you're dealing with a problem or immutable situation. Sometimes there isnt possible global truth to be attained. Sometimes you need to just decide because the opportunity cost of inaction is higher.
      anchoring problem is getting stuck
      gravity problem is something that's not possible you can't both want to be a billionaire and flip burgers at mcdonalds without doing anything else your entire life.
      Prototype and be worthy of our problems
- Create a clear alignment between who you are what you believe and what you’re doing for a living. Create 250 work and life view reflection. Measure your work life and success with money impact and expression. Pay attention and make sure your living intentionally. Understand the game you’re playing if you measure success by money in an impact job or vice versa you’ll always be unhappy. 3 types of work renewing and repairing sustaining/supporting and creating new things. The other vector is intimate and personal vs global. There are no bad spots just bad fits we need to work in this matrix and notice what is and isn’t working.
    - **Tags:** #job-advice, #incentive-allignment, #job-(your-skills-+-positive-trends), #career-advice
    - **Note:** Work can mean different things to different people, and you need to be clear about what you want from a job, both creatively impact in the world, and personally whether that be rolled or money, and then enact to do something along those lines
- Hedonic treadmill we can always be unhappy and want more but we should asses our lives as is and then be content within it before we start striving for more. Because unless we did internal happiness we’ll always be empty in our search for more. Take good enough for now and keep building towards the future. Happiness is an internal process more built on relationships than money and external things. We accept what we have is good enough for now innovate within the system we’re in and take small victories and plan for the future set the bar low. If a job is abusive leave immediately but if it’s just plain bad reshape your reality. Set the bar to change low. Set small goals you can meet and when it becomes easy set a more ambitious goal. Then keep growing. Learn create and help someone every day. Reflect on your days and savor the food party’s while analyzing the stuff that went well and poorly. Savoring and insight reflection. Move from the back to drivers seat. Start wiry micro goals to get to your big goals and create rewards to strengthen the feedback loop. Reflect on what you’re grateful for then reinforce and retain. Don’t focus on the negative celebrate the positive

    - **Note:** hedonic treadmill and ways to avoid it is really through internal happiness. Be constant and strive for more. If you can't be content in the moment you never will be and put happiness in relationships not external things.
      Set small goals and let them grow and compound. Start small scale feedback loops grow ambition. reflect in the moment while streering and taking agency over your life. Good enough for now but steps to achieve goal. Spend time with happy people skew positive and don't let bad things get you down view the world objectively
- Mindsets to reshaping are curiosity bias to action reframing awareness radical collaboration and storytelling. Get curious about your future and explore the possibilities then try stuff. Reframing is like inversion approaching the process from the right direction. Follow a process to make sure you’re going about it the right way and ask for help from many. Increase interaction nodes get involved with more people and ideas. Reach out to the world and it will reach back then tell your story to better understand it internally and concept with people externally. Interested is interesting and interesting I’d how you increase your interactions.

    - **Note:** reshape your mind with increasing your learning rate by more interactions get very curious. Make sure you are respecting the process and growing make a product for the world
