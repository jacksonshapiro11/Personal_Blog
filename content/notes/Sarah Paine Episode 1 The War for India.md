### Highlights

- **Geopolitical Alignments**
  * Analyze international relations by identifying primary adversaries and existential threats.
  * Shared existential threats create strong alliances, even among unlikely partners, while differing primary enemies hinder cooperation, even with shared ideologies.
  * You must align on a primary enemy which allies had in ww2 axis didn’t have.

  Sarah C. M. Paine
  They're sick of it. Meanwhile, the Indians weren't too thrilled about the United States either. This is earlier when Franklin Delano Roosevelt was president. Here's Mahatma Gandhi telling him, allied support for freedom and democracy seems hollow so long as America has the Negro problem in her own home. Indians were appalled by segregation. They knew exactly which end of the bus they'd be sitting on. So there are issues both ways. And in fact, Nehru and his daughter Indira Gandhi found the United States really impossible to work with. And they looked at capitalism the way station to imperialism and fascism, whereas Americans looked at socialism as the way station to communism. So there's no meeting of minds on all of this. And so if you look at the alignments of primary adversaries, India and Pakistan, most of the time, are primary adversaries. India is always Pakistan's primary enemy. But you could argue that with the 1962 war, is it Pakistan or is it China who's the primary adversary of India? And then when you get to the 1971 war, which I'll discuss a little more in a second, where Bangladesh is broken off and then Pakistan has less than half the population, then you could argue That for India, China is the primary adversary. And then if you look at that reshuffling, if you also look at the 1969 war that reshuffles the nuclear powers. So formerly, Russia and China had shared the United States as their primary enemy. But after the 69 war, they're each other's primary enemy. And this gives the United States a swing position of team up with A or team up with B. And the United States teamed up with China to overextend Russia in the Cold War, because it always felt that the Soviets were the bigger threat in those days. Anyway, as you're looking at alignments, you can apply this kind of framework to any country on the planet to try to figure out what's going on. Think about how alliances work. If I look at the World War II allies, probably one of the most effective alliances in world history, if you think about what people ultimately want, the British want an empire in which The sun never sets. The United States wants to decolonize everybody. And Joe Stalin wants a communist wonderland. Those are mutually exclusive. But to get there, you have to go through the common way station of getting rid of Hitler. So the common existential threat can be a superglue of the most unlikely partners. But let's look at the Axis. What they want at the end of the war are spheres of influence in different parts of the world. So for Italy, it's empire in the Mediterranean, Japan in the Pacific, and then Hitler, it's all over Eurasia. That's not mutually exclusive. But if you look at the primary enemy who stands in the way of those plans, it's Britain for Italy. It's Russia for the Germans. And for the Japanese, it's first China and then the United States. None of it aligns, so they fight parallel wars and allow the allies to take them out in detail. So when you're thinking about alliances in the world today, when you're wondering what's going on with Iran or whatever, figure out who's their real primary enemy. Get it straight. Does that primary enemy, is that an existential threat for them? So if you've got countries that line up on same primary enemy, existential threat for all around, the most unlikely people will cooperate. On the other hand, people who are very likely to cooperate, maybe like the fascists, they all shared this basic ideology. But if they don't have the same primary enemy and the same theater of interest, geographically the same theater, they may not cooperate very well at all. So you can apply this to anything you want to apply to. So back to my game here. If you're looking at the cards people have to play, the United States has lousy cards because we don't share primary enemies with anybody. So it's a stalemate. You help India, the Pakistanis hate you. You help Pakistanis, the Indians hate you. It's no win. But if you look at India, India and Russia share a China problem. That's good. They can cooperate on that. And then you have Pakistan and China. They share an India problem. They can make things happen over that. So there are pasta cards for them to play and zero for the United States ([Time 0:24:09](https://share.snipd.com/snip/93784b17-4f62-43d7-a9a1-d11761017fcd))
