### Highlights

- Once you’ve shifted from “interesting project” to “company” mode, be decisive and act quickly. Instead of thinking about making a decision over the course of week, think about making it in an hour, and getting it done in the next hour.
  Become formidable. Also become tough—the road ahead is going to be painful and make you doubt yourself many, many times.
  Start with an idea and make something people want don't start with a company because this will be a multi year project and you can't do something boring to you and succeed. Make a product people want and iterate listen to what users tell you improve listen until users love it. Keep the burn rate low until you've built something people love hire slowly have a strategy. Ask for what you want fire quickly and generate revenue early on. Work with people you like fire quickly hire well. A players. Figure out a way to scale and obesses over the growth rate. Don't worry about vanity metrics. Focus on being a missionary not a mercenary and don't waste time on what doesn't matter ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hm1s0fsttk3ajn5n8wqkk9av))

    - **Note:** Start with an idea not a company something you love and iterate. Cost conscious a players build a strategy go slow to go fast then scale and grow like hell. missionary not mercenary focus on what matters
- Don’t waste your time on stuff that doesn’t matter (i.e. things other than building your product, talking to your users, growing, etc.). In general, avoid the kind of stuff that might be in a movie about running a startup—meeting with lawyers and accountants, going to lots of conferences, grabbing coffee with people, sitting in lots of meetings, etc. Become a Delaware C Corp (use Clerky or any well-known Silicon Valley law firm) and then get back to work on your product.
  Focus intensely on the things that do matter. Every day, figure out what the 2 or 3 most important things for you to do are. Do those and ignore other distractions. Be a relentless execution machine.
  Do what it takes and don’t make up excuses.
  Learn to manage people. Make sure your employees are happy. Don’t ignore this.
  In addition to building a great product, if you want to be really successful, you also have to build a great company. So think a lot about your culture.
  Don’t underestimate the importance of personal connections. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hm1sew4x25tphfpn4tp12h1x))

Be an execution machine and craft a strong intentional culture don't make excuse make a great product but also build a great company with people who enjoy working with each other
