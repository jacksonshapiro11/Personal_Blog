### Highlights

- Change means we can have nothing. We can’t have the present until we accept the past and the future. The reality of the past and future make the present real. You can’t know realism until you know hope. Padap never has kids and see shiv and his daughter embracing in mutual pain and he sees how empty his life is without family and people to live for. True journey is return. His hands are empty as they had always been in the end.

    - **Note:** We exist in the present but a product of the past and future. Change means we have nothing and everything all at once. Family values and how they bring meaning to life. True journey comes when you're able to return to who you were and come back a more fully formed person. Accept life as is. We come from and return to nothing.
- Getting time on your side to make it work for you. He is reunited with his love after 4 years and they exist in time that is outside of time. When a man feels himself alone he gets scared. The books transition to showing the poor uprising against the police in the rich country right into the chapter about death from starvation in the poor one. Showing both systems have big issues but somehow the authoritarian angle is an issue in both and it’s almost a plea for liberalist freedom of thought. Every emergency led to more authoritarian government power on both sides with power concentrating towards the center. The social conscious controls the individual one so people don’t cooperate they obey. Fear neighbors opinion more than our internal desire to be freedom. They create strong implicit laws by accident. They build walls of thinking that create rules we can’t see. Invisible barriers of society. They punish freedom. They let others decide for them instead of being free to make their decisions this works against them. Shiv sees he’s being controlled and resolves against it. Sees there are still power structures in all places the individual must fight to be free. His will is frustrated but grows strong. He resolves to print his ideas and be free of the shackles of society. He gets back to the roots of the society which is the individual will to greatness through self expression and makes this the focus of his life. Society gives stability but the people give change. The society was founded on constant revolution which can only be conceived in the thinking mind not the state control. His will to create made him feel more connected not detached felt it was his duty. He saw this commitment not just something he had to commit to in science but must commit to in all areas of life. Was his duty to transform into that person for society. There is no end it’s a never ending process. If you evade suffering you evade joy. You can achieve a short term better outcome but long term structural happiness is built in deep commitment creating joy. Fulfillment is a function of time where pleasure is cyclical. Pleasure ends it’s not a continuous journey like happiness and joy. It’s a locked room a cell. Outside these locked rooms is the landscape of time we build through hard work and sacrifice. He saw the 4 years apart and that suffering as building the relationship. Even in pain make sure time works for you always. Acting in the landscape not the room is the root of human acts.
- He realizes by doing physics in his home country he rebelled but now in this new place rebellion wasn’t needed couldn’t be bargained the state owned him and only dealt in power a currency that could not be bought. The state wanted control and they controlled him totally. Does the unprovability matter or does clinging to certainty as a necessary initial condition limit us instead of just assuming we could be right, even if we can’t prove it and then perceiving from thete. This is why the incomplete serum and the math where we can still do math, but we know the system not 100% I think. But we just assumed the rules of the system and then we get innovate within that kind of paradigms too. Unreality, unlocks, and deeper reality when we open our minds. He reads old science that has been proven, and that allows him to simplify the complexity of method that units the static and the dynamic under a unified theory physics. It looked at this reality for 10 years, but his mind wasn’t open to seeing it and viewing it from this perspective. He actually made the progress but was blind to the fact that he was making it.
- Humans like challenges and seek growth through hardship. Shiv can’t get his paper published because his boss thinks it’s stupid then he gives boss co author and published it. Important because ideas ran counter to his boss ideas and would kill his self concept once they were integrated his boss was good. Freedom in adversity. It’s useless work that darkens the heart. Doing needed work brings joy to the heart. Bond is stronger than all that tries the bond. There’s a time at 20 where you could assimilate to the culture or double down on your individuality. There’s a famine and everyone fights for themselves. Existence is its own justification. He has a coworker who loves him but is trying to gain power over him still detestable thing people do. Shivock gets kicked out of the physics institute because his bosses don’t like him and they needed to make cuts and they were threaten by his uniqueness so they cut him because of their ego. He’s assigned a mid work position overall just shows dumb beauracracy and the stupid of communism.
- Shiv is doing bad work and struggling to be creative. His bouts of doubt have traditionally led to creativity but on this new planet he feels like he’s repressing himself and it doesn’t allow his thoughts to flow. People are worried in Arasi constantly and he can’t tell if it’s because they always need more money and they’ll never have enough or they’re guilty that they always have more than someone else. When in the land of property think like a propertarian. He feels very alone in a city of many. Life is a fight and the strongest win. The most social win. we either torture ourselves in our heads or in reality with blood and fighting, but they are the same. Two sides are the same. she’s arguing. Their two worlds are the same because humans are the same despite the structure of governance. The unconscious mind transcends time. The universe is like a book. Time is both linear and cyclical. So time is progress but infinite circles. The little timelessness makes up time. The universe is made of cycles repeating that are timeless and the arrow of time match forward. This is the idea of being and becoming. If the mind can see time in both these ways we can combine the two. To break a promise is to deny the reality of the past and prevent the hope of the future. We want complexity not purity. We want to ask the right questions. Understanding duration and creation. Being and becoming. Shiv says they have nothing except the light in their eyes and the adonians have everything material but lack that simple joy.

    - **Note:** The universe is cyclical being and becoming. Shiv is in a new environment and he can’t think. Environment shapes behavior. He’s struggling to exist in this strange land. The author is arguing we’re either in a mental or physical fight, but the torture is the same. We’re only given our soul. Time is both linear and cyclical. We’re both going forward but then experiencing the same patterns again and again. The world is being and becoming. Don't mentally torture ourselves there is no benefit
- Shivock meets this woman who he forms a deep bond with. He finds his soul mate. Be was sexually and creatively frustrated at first it’s awkward but then they open their minds and body’s up to each other and it feels natural even easy. This type of relationship is ironic in the communist community. She tackver was connected to the universe some people never get severed from the umbilical cord of connection they’re born with and love the entire universe. She loved biology because she loved accurate and factual research with betterment. But she really loved being connected to the universe. Being one with it. This love opens his heart and he sees his last 4 years of hopeless work for the progress he made they weren’t lost even though they were his lost years but they laid the groundwork for his future. The love opened his heart. She has a connected universe philosophy and all their friends looked up to the love they had. They look at the other universe and and envy it you always see the problems and other things but never yourself even though everyone everywhere rich or poor has similar problems we think the grass is always greener.
- Turns out in this new world the government is spying on everyone. Shevick is inventing a new kind of travel that will give him the most power in the world and ever everyone wants it from him and he hast to leverage it properly. At work, they have intrinsic motivation that drives them. Art was seen as a basic technique of life. Shiv feels alone on his planet and that he’s wasting his life in his mid-20s. He feels his best days are behind him and he will never do anything great again. He has very little to show for his life except regret. He runs into an old friend and says he’s in the wrong field. He wants to give up physics, but his friend tells him that he’s a natural and he cannot give it up. He’s considering killing himself. Feels like a failure. He’s running against a wall. He’s been frustrated. While it is country country, he still has to run against public opinion. He doesn’t acknowledge the reality of public opinion and peoples views around the world, even in a communist country. Pain can be physical or emotional change is freedom. They let cooperation become obedience. Stability gives authoritarian power and it must be resisted with a system and avoidance of authoritarian rule. The will to dominance is a central human impulse. People got mad when you thought for yourself. Shivock talks to Bo’s revolutionary friend who shows him how much the government is fighting and stifling individual thought and there’s able to do this more in softer fields like music than ditch digging. His eyes are opening to the hypocrisy of his world.

    - **Note:** Shivock sees the world as it is that power and the government uses people as pawns. He feels alone and lost in his world. Transition in his life not sure if he should double down on who he was or become someone new identity crisis and self doubt hitting glass ceilings. Feels like a failure. Interesting commentary about authoritarian governments and how concentration of power must be resisted. Government wants us to be a mass and think as a group he sees hypocracy and the only true freedom is individual liberation. Public opinion can be powerful. Thinking for yourself can be very controversial. We all feel like failures wasting our lives at some point and we need to push through.
- Shiv realizes and becomes a loner completely learns physics by himself and has limited to no external relationships. He has to keep things to himself which very new in his collective society to grasp power. He has privacy which is tough for him to understand but he realizes he needs quiet to do his best work. His gentleness was uncompromising because he wouldn’t compete for dominance he was indomitable. Shivock realizes that he’s horse trading his career to get exposure he gives his boss half credit for doing nothing. He needs to compromise but the relationship is very new and tough for him. Different than anything in his culture. We do unreasonable things in old age to justify going on at all. Shivock comments on how accidemics is just teaching to a test. Not teaching to learn. Also, it used to be a Aristocats conveyed Providence on the school now with the other way around the school makes aristocrats. Starts to learn economics even though he hates it because it’s the way of the new world. He is disgusted by consumerism. Has nightmares about the marketplace.
- Life is suffering and pain and transcendence comes not by ignoring that but conquering pain and surpassing it. He’s afraid of life and happiness seems trivial with all the pain but thinks that he misunderstands pain instead of a bad thing. It’s an opportunity. It’s the self that suffers if you can endure conquer the fear of pain to live the life you want that’s the meaning of life and it’s possible. There is something beyond pain. The reality of pain isn’t pain. Love is just a way to get through pain. When we suffer, but not enough, we continue to endure pain. We shouldn’t prevent suffering. We cannot save each other. Brotherhood begins in shared pain, not in saving each other. When you’re going through hell keep going. Paradise is for those who build it. Shiv feels like he doesn’t deserve the nice things on this planet because his people left looking to the future. The future becomes the past and the past becomes the future at the same rate. To deny isn’t to achieve the explorer who doesn’t come back is an adventurer in exhile. Shiv releases he’s an exhile to both societies.
- From a young kid they’re fed these stories that urus is a dystopian society but he realizes that information is 100s of years old and has the intellectual curiosity to question his reality. Hate comes from fear of the unknown. The concept of father is not specific it can be an uncle or cousin but the connotation is the same as dad. He’s a free loving culture both men and women. Shiv is a great physicist but he’s forced to work hard labor. There is a reward in hard labor but shows the backwards culture. Women in this young adult stage are mature wanting a long-term relationship where the men are still immature chasing sex. They’re over intellectual not wanting to commit to work or sex and playing around with immature women. Shiv enjoyed being alone. He knew the idea of home was transient and when you leave a place you can never return because the place changes. Don’t let false egalitarianism trick you follow your interests. In this culture there are no possessive pronouns. Shiv leaves and he realizes everyone respects and loves him more than he thought. This is normally the case people like us more than we think.
- Shivock leaves his home planet for an unclear reason. Clearly there was some unrest and people never left the planet. They weren’t allowed his leaving was controversial. The culture are one rich one very poor. The rich admit not religion or morality outside their books. The less advanced civilization sees men and women as equal but the more advanced one is more hierarchical. Shivock and the poor planet sees all creatures as equal. The more advanced sees them on top and men on top of women while the poorer planet sees equality. They bring Shivock to the planet because he’s a good scientist and it’s partly diplomacy. It’s clear the poorer planet is a more communist collective society. Shiv growing up wants to think independently and learn but is scolded and told not to do that because everyone should be equal and differentiation is vain. He’s clearly very smart in a primitive society and wants to learn as much as possible but society resists this. Push and pull of this society and young creatives. Allegory to the world. The idea of prison is also crazy bad and foreign. They build a prison but need to experience it and try it for themselves. Turns into Stanford prison experiment. Some people can’t visualize need to experience

    - **Note:** Interesting juxtaposition between the communist society, and the capitalist society. it parodies both and ends up making the society circular in someway shows clears drawbacks between the lack of communist production, and the overbearing nature and inequality of capitalism. Communism stunts, all growth that would cause anyone to be different and capitalism stunts all action that makes people equal. Freedom equality. Stanford prison, experiment and abuse of authority.
