  Speaker 1
  Overtime, herby turned the tricks he learned in brooklyn into a philosophy. It was a kind of jewish buddhism. He preaches engaged detachment, characterized as caring, but not that much more than a business strategy. He considers this a way of life. Don't get fixated on a particular outcome. He would say, always be willing to walk away. Once you see your life as a game and the things you strive for as no more than pieces in that game, you'll become a much more effective player. Most of his parental advice is about maintaining perspective, which he does by dismissing whatever is rently bothering you as a walnut in the batter of life, a blip on the radar screen Of eternity. The man is besotted with aphorisms. He would say things like, we're all captives of the pictures in our heads. We see things not as they are, but as we are. The key to walking on water is knowing the stones are. Time heals all wounds, right up to the moment it kills you. And so herby was gifted with language. He was really good at story telling.

- Do You Have Power?
  Key takeaways:
  - Herby's experience as a crossing guard at nine years old taught him a lifelong principle that power is based on perceptions and most people will obey any type of authority.

  Speaker 1
  This was a story that happened when herby was nine years old. And the larry in story is larry king, his lifelong friend. They started debating in the street, arguing. Larry said that crossing kids on their way to school was busy work. It was a joke. So larry and herby had been made crossing guards by their school. And so their having this debate over whether they want to do it or not. And it says herby it's a position with real power, he said. Herby walked to the middle of nineteenth avenue and held up his hand, bringing traffic to a stop. It is simple as this. Herby said, he was proving what would become a lifelong principle, most people are shmucks and will obey any type of authority, even if just a nine year old in an orange sash. As he'd say later in lectures, power is based on perceptions. If you think you've got it, you've got it, even if you don't got it. Cars and trucks were soon backed up for blocks. And the way i would summarize the lesson that he's trying to teach his son is t pretend to be in control, and peoplewill assume that you are. So that reminded me of this thing i read in steve job's biography by walter isaacson, where nolan bushnow the founder of a tory, is talking about meeting steve. So nolan's like, you know, maybe a decade older than steve was, and he hires, like, a 19 year old steve jobs to work at a tory. And he said, tat there was something indefinable in an onch preneur. And he saw that characteristic in steve jobbs, even when steve was really young. And nolan gave him advice that steve use for his entire life. If he read any biography of steve jobbs, was obvious. And nolan said, i taught him that if you actually you can do something, then it will work. I told him, pretend to be completely in trol, and people will assume that you are.

    - **Note:** Power is based on perception people are schmucks and will generally believe you. Pretend to be control and people will believe you.
