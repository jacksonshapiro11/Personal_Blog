- Embrace Being Over Doing
  Summary:
  Well-being consists of two interconnected aspects: 'well' and 'being.' The sense of 'well' embodies inner peace, self-acceptance, and an unshakeable connection to oneself, independent of external circumstances.
  This realization fosters self-kindness and an appreciation for life's imperfections. On the other hand, 'being' contrasts with the societal obsession with 'doing' — a constant pursuit of tasks and accomplishments that offers external validation.
  'Being' invites a state of mind where one engages in activities without the pressure of achievement, focusing instead on genuine connection and presence.
  As individuals age, the challenge lies in shifting from a doing-oriented mindset to embracing being, cultivating a sense of inner settlement and purpose beyond societal expectations.
  External markers of success, such as magazine covers, often mask true well-being, revealing that many successful individuals may lack deep fulfillment. Recognizing this discrepancy invites a deeper exploration of self and purpose, often catalyzed by personal crises that teach appreciation for the simple joys of life.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  If you think about well-being, it's really two different words because they're connected when we say them, we think about it as one thing. And if you look at the definition of well-being, it makes no sense. It's like double talk. But if you couple those two words, will is actually that feeling that you get a peacefulness inside, that connection to your soul, that sense that you are showing up the way you want to Show up, that you're in control, that you're your own best friend, that no matter what's happening in the world, nothing can change that feeling inside. And that to me has been the biggest realization of the last two years. It's like I am really well and I am well because you know what? I'm kind to myself, I like my life, I do the best I can, I screw up all the time, I laugh at myself. And then being is the one that I find so interesting. We were talking about goals and no goals and the value of goals. And think about another one. It's like we spent all our time doing things. We have to do this. Everything is a do. Society rewards us for accomplishing things, for 450 podcasts, for this and that, that's doing. And what you realize when you get to my age is like being, it's like a much better state of mind. Being is a place where there's nothing to do, where you're actually doing things for no reason at all. You're doing it because you feel connected to whatever it is. And it's really hard when you spend 110% of your time doing to find the muscle and find the space to start being. And well-being is a place where you feel really settled inside and you spend the time you want just feeling connected to whatever you want to be connected to. And you suspend all the societal bullshit that we give so much power to that manipulates the way that we think the world wants us to show up. So to me, this is like a really interesting journey. And I think I'm early in this journey. My hope is in the next 10, 20 years is die peacefully will be understanding that I became super clear on how to live life the way that I think my soul was intended to live.
  Speaker 2
  Let's say a group of financially successful people that appear on the covers of magazines or something? How many of them are well or are thinking about this? I don't know many people that are well.
  Speaker 1
  I think everybody's on a journey, but you and I know a lot of people that are in those magazines. And it's not that they don't have well moments and it's not like they're good is a bad thing either. But it's just really hard for our egos. It's really hard for what others may say of us. It's really hard for society's value to put on us, not to affect us. And the fact that you're in the cover of a magazine tells you something. Vanity is life's greatest sin. A little bit of this, you got to decide what it is, but it can't become you. You can't put that inside of you. Think we're all in some struggle, in some journey to find our connection to ourselves. And crisis usually reveals that. And that was, to me, the big transition for me is this crisis is giving me a perspective of like true appreciation of the really nice things you and I get to do every day. ([Time 0:31:00](https://share.snipd.com/snip/038b1e62-7128-4c71-925e-56af419c27e8))
    - **Note:** Doing vs being and living well. Wellbeing. Vanity is life’s greatest thing.
- Embrace the Gift of Mortality
  Summary:
  Experiencing a near-death situation can profoundly reshape one’s perspective on life and purpose.
  In moments of imminent death, a deep sense of clarity often surfaces, revealing regrets about unfulfilled potential and the realization of life's fragility. Such experiences can ignite a commitment to live with intention, express love openly, and seek forgiveness quickly.
  It highlights the significance of letting go of ego-driven comparisons and guilt, fostering a more compassionate self-dialogue.
  True forgiveness emerges when it originates from love, transcending the need for apologies.
  Recognizing that life can change in an instant encourages a focus on leaving a meaningful impact, prioritizing relationships, and contributing positively to the world. Ultimately, the challenges faced in life become essential catalysts for personal growth and purpose.

  Speaker 2
  You were in a very high profile crisis once in the plane that Sully landed on the Hudson River, I think in the front row seat. Can you describe the last five minutes of that experience? The experience I think was three and a half minutes.
  Speaker 1
  So I think you're like little, the whole thing. Look, it's the greatest gift one can get. It's the greatest gift to know that you're going to die.
  Speaker 2
  Were you certain of that?
  Speaker 1
  A hundred percent certain. It was either I'm going to blow up, and that will be a lot better than breaking into pieces in January 15th in the Hudson River in New York and freezing in 40 seconds. If you were given those two options, I think blowing up is better. And then you have 90 seconds to say goodbye to your life with no suffering, zero suffering. And then on the other side of this, no one dies. So you can talk about it and celebrate it and understand it at a time where our country was an incredible crisis. We were coming out of the financial crisis of, wait, this country was in a low place looking for a story. So we were really lucky that we had the most incredible pilot on that seat that day that in many ways, and we can talk about him, he'd been preparing for that moment his whole life. He was a gliding instructor. Later on, I've gotten to know him really well. And you say you're only a pilot when you lose an engine. Otherwise, you're just managing the autopilot or whatever the inputs in the computer. In that day, it was a New York call day. I was coming home to Charlotte. My biggest concern was landing and coaching my son's basketball practice. And as we take off, there's a large explosion in the plane. Bam! Half asleep as you're taking off you realize I look at the flight attendant and I'm in 1D so I can see the flight attendant. There's nothing in their face just like annoyance if like this is gonna be and whatever because we turn the plane right away and nothing is happening. Smoke is coming in, you can hear the engine struggling but you think we're just going to go back landing. We're not that high, probably 3,000, 4,000 feet high. And then all of a sudden Sully gets on the microphone and says, this is your captain. So he identifies himself. And he says three words, the only three words he said. And this was the moment. He says, brace for impact. The movie is actually very true to a lot of it, especially to this. But at that moment, I look back at the flight attendant, Patrick, and then all of a sudden, it's complete terror in her eyes. She's like, holy cow, in training, this is we are not landing at an airport. I don't know that, but I can see her eyes, and I know that. That's what it means. And the great gift of that day was 90 seconds to literally say, it's over. I am sitting there going like, oh my goodness, it's over. Not only is it over, and then some people, you may have a near-death experience of a second or two seconds, this is a minute and a half, to basically sign off from life. And that's for me been super formative. Previous to this last year and a half, it was a real moment of kind of resignation in life. And lots of things happen from how have I dealt with spiritual beliefs from that time all the way to how it did impact my life. And I did that TED talk, not knowing that it would ever get published. But by the way, it was the greatest gift I give myself because people talk about it. And it's a reminder of me of a promise I made to myself that day, which is I was not going to let that experience. Someday, I wanted to be a part of me, not something that happened to me. I've tried to live very hard, very consciously of the gift I got that day.
  Speaker 2
  Can you remember sequentially what went through your head in those 90 seconds?
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, when I think about it, and I think about it now more evolved with time behind is a Lot of it had to do with the immediate emotion that I felt was just oh, no, it's over Is this sense of Real regret that it's over and there were so many things I had left undone? It all changed an instant. Life changes in an instant. We all have had friends that things have happened to in an instant. And I think in our evolution, we're unable to process that because we would have never left the cave if we felt that, right? So there's this concept called hedonic adaptation that we will adapt to whatever situation, that's what life is about we have adopted this thing and that was for me this notion of gosh When the plane landed I am gonna live with intense purpose every day I am gonna ask for forgiveness the moment I do something wrong I'm gonna drink my best wines whenever the person is There I'm gonna to say, I love you to anybody I love. I am going to try my very best every day to try to like not regret not doing or saying something. And that was wonderful. So I live out loud, so to speak, because I know it's going to change in an instant. Tomorrow may be that instant and I'm not having that regret if it happens. The second thing that I thought about it was like you're going to super human, right? You're adrenaline is shooting, you're in survival mode, you're going to die. There was this sense of, almost embarrassment, of how much I had allowed my ego to be who showed up in the world. How much I had spent energy being wronged by people, or being more or less than, better or worse than, how much my ego played a role in how I showed up every day. And it was this notion that, you know what, I hate it. I hated what that meant, and that I didn't realize that that was a mask that I was putting on and that I didn't need to have that mask on. That ego started with, okay, where does that come from? And for me Patrick was a lot of learning. I have this moment when the plane is gonna crash. We talked about religion a bit today and I don't share this a lot. I don't know how people take it but I ask myself, okay, do I buy insurance? I can ask for forgiveness. I was raised Catholic. I can ask for insurance right now and for sure if there is such a thing and I was not, I'm not a practicing Catholic or wasn't at the time a practicing Catholic and I said to myself I am not Because I'm not a hypocrite. I may be all flawed in many ways but it's not that and it just didn't feel natural to me. And what happened as a result to me after that, after just saying, hey, this is who I am, is I let go of all guilt. Not that I don't take responsibility, but the forgiveness happened to myself at the moment. It's like I no longer had this notion, and I think guilt drives a lot of our ego, a lot of our comparison set, a lot of this notion of having to be right versus choosing to be happy. And look, this is not a perfect journey. And at times your ego gets caught up in this and your ego gets in the way. Trust me, compared to when this happened, I am incredibly, incredibly lighter. I don't wanna die, and I don't want the ego to be the one that shows up every day. And as a result the ([Time 0:34:13](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5b1d2edb-a688-4ecf-978d-84f8bcc93533))
    - **Note:** How a near death experience changes your outlook on life and focuses you on what’s important. Life is too short for guilt and hate. Crashing into the Hudson River.
- Culture is Created, Not Preached
  Summary:
  Strong teams prioritize relationships and a culture of belonging over mere performance metrics.
  Successful leadership involves investing in players' well-being and fostering an environment where teammates support each other, creating lasting bonds. Culture is built through actions and values rather than mere words, emphasizing team-first principles.
  The experience of belonging leads to meaningful memories, enriching both personal lives and community ties.
  Ultimately, the joy of shared experiences matters more than winning, as these connections are what endure beyond the season.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  There were three polls at the beginning of the season. We were ranked 12, 11 and 12. There's 12 teams. We were the easy game in everybody's schedule. Fast forward. We are playing game seven of the finals tomorrow night. And it's been the craziest, most fun ride. And you know what? I realized, Patrick, I had never owned a toy as an adult, a toy where you literally do it for the pleasure of it. And the connections, the ability to bring a philosophical approach to this, the relationships, running it in a very different way, investing differently. All came through in the middle of the season, not wearing the finals, say, this is my favorite team I've ever been a part of. And it's all culture. At the end of the day, Patrick, we all want to belong to places that we feel connected to. And the magic of organizations is understanding that. And in this world, we are so disconnected from so many things. People no longer belong to civic groups or churches or all of this. And the ability to create connections. Look, this town is going crazy. Win or loss, it didn't lose. It doesn't matter. It's like, it's so good. Like if you go through the year, go back to your calendar and say, what are the things that I'm going to remember 10 years from now? You'll be shocked how few they are. If you're lucky, you have six, seven, usually experiences, usually things that are either surprising and it involves different things. And it's a really good exercise to do because you're like, okay, how do I do more of those? I need to design that into my calendar. I tell you, I have like three of them that are going to show up at the end of the year, including two nights ago when we're down 10 with two and a half minutes, game six on the road, we send it To overtime. We're going to double overtime and we win. I can't sleep the whole night. I have a leadership meeting yesterday, which I am completely exhausted for. And it was the greatest thing ever.
  Speaker 2
  So it's been awesome. So tell me what you did. How did the culture change? What is the culture of the team? Like I went and asked everybody and don't for change Someone told me that you called and we're talking in the locker room to every player, one on one, you are involved. This is not something that you're just phoning in.
  Speaker 1
  I've been in Puerto Rico nine times, and I can literally go hold down for two games and run back, so I just get so much joy out of it. It's just uncomfortable to talk about that. OK, now I'll give you a little bit. The first practice we show up, all these players are looking at like, okay, new owner, players don't trust owners, they get treated like merchandise, they get lied to, they get all this Stuff. They're very skeptical. So you can't show up and say, hey, we're going to build a culture of this and that and the other. So I showed up and said, look, there's literally three rules here. We are going to invest in you so that you can make more money out of your career here or anywhere. And here's what that means. We put in a full weight room. We put in a bunch of staff. They're looking at us like a little bit like incredulous. It's like, we're going to do this. Number two is we're actually not going to care about the goal. Teams have goals. You know, this is someone saying, franchises have systems. We're gonna build a system, and we're gonna play in a certain way, and we're gonna do certain things, and then there's nobody that is above the team. So this is a team first and all of that, and we for the treble later, a lot of this, and we signed a big free agent. I think it was two or three days later we fired him, because he was a jerk. Culture is what you tolerate, it's not what you preach. Our best player we suspended and never told anybody because he was not behaving in a way that was culture-fest. He begged to come back, he's the most amazing teammate. This guy says I've never been part of a team, these kids get treated like whatever. So great teams, great teams in anything in life. It is team first. Because most places are player first. Exceptional teams that where they exceed their expectations, where we are, we are like the eighth best team, not the second or first best team, is when there's teammates first. These guys, the love that they feel for each other is beautiful. And the great thing about teams back to community is like, once you are part of an experience like that, the team will end, you will be teammates for life. And that to me is the beautiful part of all of this. Regardless how that story ends, and this may have been our lucky season, we may never make it again. It does not matter. No one there's a saying in Spanish, ¿No me puede quita lo hay lao? Nadi a me quita lo hay lao que quiereso? You can never take away the songs I've danced. We go to the games, all my friends are sitting in the friend's row. Like, it is literally a reunion of high school there and it's just beautiful. It's just beautiful. Towns are so passionate. It's crazy the love that they have for the game. There's a parade on Saturday to celebrate our championship. I hope we win.
  Speaker 2
  How could I watch this game?
  Speaker 1
  It's on YouTube actually. It was like 50,000 people on YouTube in the US watching the last one.
  Speaker 2
  Incredible. Oh man, I hope you win. But it doesn't matter. Like he says. It doesn't matter.
  Speaker 1
  It's a game. There's no winning. We want it ready.
  Speaker 2
  It lets me jump back to our list 39 to 57 on leadership. ([Time 0:48:42](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b8de5b98-2514-4a0a-ba76-dad2ffa2dc69))
    - **Note:** Building a culture and the importance of having a community in life. Buying a basketball team building the culture creating a community.
- Leadership is Earned Through Authenticity
  Summary:
  Leadership transcends titles and roles; it is determined by how others perceive you and what you earn through your actions.
  The essence of leadership lies in personal growth, self-awareness, and consistent behavior. Leaders must understand themselves and display humanity, acknowledging imperfections and learning from experiences.
  True leaders are respected for their fairness, clarity, and kindness, rather than seeking perfection.
  The journey of leadership involves continuous learning and demonstrating compassion, making genuine connections while navigating challenges.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  It lets me jump back to our list 39 to 57 on leadership. And I was thinking about this as you were talking about Sully and how to characterize him. And he seems like an incredibly quiet, humble professional. I don't know if you would call himself a leader. I don't know what that means. Lots of good sounding definitions about it, but rather than ask you like to define it or versions of it that you've seen, I'm actually more curious in how you think it's changed for you In that 18 year period. It changes a lot.
  Speaker 1
  I'm surprised at how many things I was convicted of that I've changed my mind on. Part of it, maybe chemical, part of it maybe experience, part of it is you realize at the end of the day, what is it that matters and all that. I think leadership, first of all, title is not leadership, role is not leadership, other people decide if you're a leader or not. It's not something that you have, it's something you earn, and I think that's something that you got to take really really personal. Now, that doesn't mean that good leaders are not liked, they're respected. And they're respected for being consistent, being clear, being fair, giving, being all the things that matter kind and all these different things. But leadership to me is, it's a way you show up every day. And it starts with personal leadership. I don't think you can be a leader in the world if you don't have control of yourself, if you don't really understand yourself. And then it's an imperfect art and you're constantly growing and learning. And we had a staff meeting yesterday in the morning, you know, I think it was fantastic. And in the afternoon, I didn't show up that great. And I was exhausted from that silly game. And I was short-fused. I was like, I got in the car, like, ah, that wasn't my best performance. And then I laughed, and then I'll own it and move on. Leadership, a lot of it is how you show what it is to be human. A lot of leaders feel like they have to pretend to be perfect. And, look, we all have insecurities. We all have challenges. And to me, leaders is showing the way of humanity of how to do growth and how to care for others and how to do things that matter.

- Courage Cultivates Confidence
  Summary:
  Courage and confidence are intertwined in personal growth and success.
  In the twenties, confidence is cultivated through experiences of belonging and competition, which fosters the belief that one can navigate various challenges. This foundation of confidence is crucial for developing courage in the thirties, a time often marked by struggles and significant life decisions.
  The courage to persevere through adversity, such as dealing with hardships in personal and professional realms, drives individuals to take risks and pursue their ambitions.
  Ultimately, the journey from confidence to courage is essential for overcoming obstacles and achieving personal independence and fulfillment.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  You described earlier for fun going through our decades and trying to label the decades a little bit with like a word or two. You said for your thirties that courage was the word. Yeah. It was an interesting word. And that for your twenties, it was confidence. Can you describe why courage? That's so interesting.
  Speaker 1
  I actually want to answer confidence because confidence goes into courage. I think you need that confidence. So, like, I'm 20, I'm a sophomore in college, I don't know much English, I'm an accounting major, so I don't have to speak. I'm in a really cold place in Boston, I feel weird, I dress different, I speak different, I act different, I'm Puerto Rican. And actually, that was really good to feel that. I'm working all sorts of jobs, I drive a limo, I do the things that people do in college. And like, for me, I graduated. I'm like, okay, what am I going to do? My dad was an OBGYN, so I couldn't go back to his practice. I was like, okay. And I ended up in Japan. And I go to Japan. And I'm like, holy cow, there's no internet, there's no anything. I struggle. I was lonely. I figure out a way to take a six month assignment, stay two years, I would general electric at the time. And all of a sudden I'm like, I should just apply to Harvard Business School. They're not gonna take me, but you know what, who knows? And that's the only place I apply. And all of a sudden I forgot I apply, I get a letter, it's like do you remember a class of 94? I'm like, holy cow, they let me in. So I'm like, whatever, 26? And I get to Harvard thinking, I'm definitely not gonna make it. I'm gonna be one of the 10% that fills the screen. I literally spent my first month smarter, smarter, yeah, dumber, smarter, smarter. I'm trying to figure out. And I realized like, you know what, everybody's the same. So I got confidence. Like I could compete in any level. I can compete in college. I can compete in Japan. I can be okay. I can figure it out. I have tools. And I got a lot of confidence and I finished business school and everybody was gonna McKinsey or investment banking. I'm like, you know what? I've always kind of listened to a different radio station the most and I always knew I wanted to run a business, start a business, I wanted to be independent. I have a story of my grandpa someday, I'll tell you, but that was my vision, to be independent. I was like, I'm gonna learn. A professor told me, if that's what you want, go and learn on someone else's nickel. And that's what I did. And that's where I met Dan. That's where I met Brenda, my wife. And, you know, at 30, which is the change of decades, that's when, like, literally, I got married and basically we started the business. So the 20s was the place where I was like, look, I belong anywhere. I'm not better than anybody, but I'm not worse than anybody. To this day I show up and like all this meetings and I kind of laugh. I'm like how in the world that I end up in this room I'm sure sometimes that happens to you right at Joe. I start singing my hit one of us is not like the others No one above no one below so the 30s a little bit of this is We struggle we struggle in their losing all this pregnancies was really, Really hard on our marriage. And we were this close to quitting and going down the path of building our family in a different way. Took a lot of courage and not quitting the business. Took a lot of courage and borrowing money from my dad to live for a couple of years after we depleted the little we have took a lot of courage and hustling our way every day for a long time Convincing people like I was like holy cow ignorance is a bliss and necessity is actually a really driving factor. See it wasn't until 40 that I would say okay we're gonna be okay even if it's at a level that is not good enough. I build a lot of courage. I'm like you know what I'll go for anything with a little luck and I'm right people around you, anything can happen.

- Seek Fulfillment, Not Just More
  Summary:
  Relentless pursuit of more can erode inner peace and well-being, masking the importance of fulfillment and purpose.
  True contentment arises from calmness and meaningful connections rather than constant ambition. The transformation of capital should focus on impactful endeavors that enhance personal and societal values, rather than merely compounding wealth.
  Engaging in genuine curiosity during conversations fosters connections, but true friendships require reciprocity.
  Self-awareness in relationships is crucial; one must allow others to contribute love and support, creating a balanced exchange that combats feelings of isolation.

  Speaker 2
  It's just, it's the gene pool of, I got my grandpa's gene of being a merchant. Fast forward a number of years and you and I were on a walk and you said something to me, which was something to the effect of be careful about the relentless pursuit of more. Thinking of that in contrast to the story you just told.
  Speaker 1
  Say a bit more about that idea. It hit me kind of hard. Society sets us up on a trick. Although this is a mirage. Every time you get to a peak you'll see higher peaks. There's nothing about a peak that matters. Sometimes it's over said about the journey and this and the other. It's that inner peace, that sense of well-being that really matters. How many days of your life do you have a sense of calm and peacefulness and purpose and you're in a good place, you feel like your energy is in a good place. To me, that's what really matters and the pursuit of more wraps you from that. You can't take it with you. It becomes the responsibility the more you have. And I tell this to a lot of our employees when they're leaving and I said, okay, great, you're ready to graduate. I'm for you. But when they're replacing happy with happier, that's when they get in trouble. There's no such thing. I have a fun exchange. An employee came in and I was like, hey, you're back, great. We have a bunch of boomerangs. It's silly how many boomerangs we have. And I'm like, you're back. I was like, and I jokingly said, hey, the grass wasn't greener. He goes, no, I like this brown. It's true. Everything is a little brown. I stopped pursuing more. That's why anything I do from here and out with my capital, the return on the capital, I don't invest anymore on funds. I don't invest in anything. I don't want to compound capital. I know that sounds like... Sacrilegious. I want to use my capital to compound other things that matter to me. So I'm using my capital in Puerto Rico to do things that really matter to me. This whole notion of purpose. My original purpose is through my kids, is through my friends, is through my community, but like I am incredibly privileged to broaden that purpose to things that are good for society. That's all that matters. Capital for capital what? You're never going to be Bezos or whoever else.

  That's a silly game. Was really interesting around this idea of like 90, 10 in a conversation where I think maybe you and I are both tend to really be curious about other people and ask a million questions And very often finish a conversation having only spoken 10% of the time or something like that, which I guess I've always thought is like a nice thing to do for somebody else, like be genuinely Curious about them, like to think I'm that way. But do you have a different perspective on this? Can you explain that?

  Look, somebody that is looking for love, the best thing that you can do is ask a lot of questions because people love people that listen to them. You can ingratiate yourself shortly to somebody who says, oh, how good, it was wonderful, it's because you talk a lot about yourself. That said, one of the beauties of true friendships is allowing the other party to feel that they can love you back. And I told you the story of a dear friend of mine, one of my best best friends, it's like my first best friend in the US, his name was John Woods, he passed a number of years ago. John was a little older, but still kind of in college with me because someone who worked in those studies. And one day, many years later, I have dinner with him in Boston and his wife is also a great friend of mine and she goes back and asked him a bunch of questions about me and he had no answer. He literally called me the next day dead serious. This is one of the guys that was like most fun jovial guys. He calls me to fire me as his friend. I was in his wedding party. He was in my wedding party. We're like brothers. And he wasn't kidding. At first I thought, oh yeah, this is really, I just saw you last night, we drank two bottles of wine. We like literally told each other we love each other. And you're firing me the next day? And he said, you are the most selfish friend I have. I was like, you just talk for 90% of the time. I just, I bought dinner. I like, what else can I do? Right? And he goes, you don't ever let anybody else love you back. And you'd suck all the love out of every interaction, because that's how you feel good about yourself. Who is not able to be a receiver. And it was, holy cow. At the time, I'm like, wow, this guy went loony. And then the more I thought about it, the more true it is. I used to be in the place I always picked up every time. That's selfish. Letting people in your true friends, I now share my struggles the last two years. I literally, because in part, what I was doing was letting them love me by me loving them. I guess this language of trust is a language I'm like, I'm very open with people that I trust because it's what friendships are about. And that's how we get helped. And I think a lot of people are out there feeling lonely, feeling like I can't share. Well, if there's somebody out there that you think loves you, give them a chance to you back.

    - **Note:** The meaning of life isn’t to be happier it’s to be happy you need to allow people to love you back. Don’t be afraid to be yourself. If you do something you want and the people around you abandon you they weren’t really your friends and those aren’t relationships worth having. The one who wants more is poor.
