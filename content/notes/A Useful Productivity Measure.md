- Category: #articles

- Summary: The author shares struggles with measuring software productivity but finds value in focusing on indicators like profitability and value-add capacity. By using a metric called value-add capacity, which measures time spent on adding value for users, the author aims to improve engineering output without increasing spending. The text emphasizes the importance of honest data and the need to prioritize delivering valuable software over fixating on productivity metrics.

### Highlights

- A Better Measure of Productivity... For Now
  The RoI metrics rely on us having product bets. But we don’t. Not yet. We’re still rolling them out. So, no matter how good the metrics might be, we can’t use them. No data.
  There’s a third indicator in the “profitability” category we *can* use, though. It’s value-add capacity.
  Like any engineering organization, we spend some percent of our time on fixing bugs, performing maintenance, and other things that are necessary but don’t add value from a customer or user perspective. The Japanese term for this is *muda.*
  If we didn’t have any muda, spent all our time on value-add work, and achieved a 10x return on each investment, our productivity would be ten: $10 for every $1 in salary (or close enough). If we spent 80% of our time on value-add work, our productivity would be eight. Twenty percent, two.
  In other words, in the absence of RoI measures, the percent of engineering time spent on value-add activities is a pretty good proxy for productivity.
  That’s the productivity number I reported to Leadership last week. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hy9pt38kqdp06dm5kmgjea3c))
