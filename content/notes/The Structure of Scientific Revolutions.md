### Highlights

- This was underscoring the community structure of science and sets a need to explore similar and comparative structure of other fields. How is one elected to membership into a community what is the process and what are the stages of socialization to the group what does the group collectively see as its goals what deviations collective or individual will it tolerate and how does it control anomalies. Scientific knowledge is the common property of a group. To understand this language well need to understand the characteristics of the groups that create this language and use it
- Two ways to adopt a paradigm conversion or translation. Conversation is you fully change everything to adopt a mew world view this is generally easier earlier. Translation is when the opposite paradigm needs to be adapted into another groups language of science first. This means it will not be truly theirs until they adopt the vernacular or the Method under their language. Sometime people will adapt new languages and models without realizing if they have passed many tests still others will accept the new science but wiuthoyt knowledge of the native language be forever outsiders to the area of study because their beliefs might change but their internal models are calibrated another way to make them incompatible no matter what
- Where perception ends interpretation begins there is the physical stimuli and how it is seen. A layman looks at an electric current monitor and sees a number where a practioner understands the system better. For a lay person to gain this understanding they would have to understand the ins and outs of the field at large perception is informed by past experiences

    - **Note:** In the hands of the right/ wrong people value is created and destroyed rapidly. A bat in my hands is a weapon in judges it’s 350mm. Anyone can read a number but not everyone can deeply understand a complex system it takes time.
      Where perception ends interpretation begins there is the physical stimuli and how it is seen. we cast our bias and models on our experiences to get a different experience from others
- Science isn’t about learning creativity but process and churn. Science has no answer or goals just progress there is no right or wrong way of the world there is just the future and way of the world there is no agenda. People want to see there is a plan humans are not rational beings but rationalizing being we can’t accept science is taking a more or lesss random walk with no final arrival poiny

    - **Note:** This is something I half agree with. The progress and infinite knowledge I agree with but science is not a process but and idea generated emergent phenomena.
- Paradigm change is often slow and can take generations to unseat the old paradigm because of the current biases in the field but human factors can influence change as well such as explosive demonstration that show something under the old paradigm. Leaders in the field changing their mind also have a large effect as people will listen and follow because they’re human. For a new paradigm there are people in both camps no one is every fully in one and evidence is built up and more people accept the theory that makes more sense and eventually this becomes accepted science. The man that hasn’t converted after his entire field has has ceased to be a scientist

    - **Note:** Change is slow and difficult even when you show people they are clearly wrong you need to shift the Overton window of accepted science. Change is like fighting uphill. Requires support patience and time.
- Textbooks do not tell science history correct they show science as a linear process and history is all folding in to work toward the current paradigm. Science portrays the current version as the truth and changes the past to make a cohesive story but this actually is nothing the case in reality it’s a cycle of disruption but at every mew paradigm history is altered and the path to get there is forgotten to fit the narrative

    - **Note:** Our view of the past is biased and history and discovery is more messy than we give it credit for it’s not a straight line you can only connect the dots looking back.
- What a man sees is what he looks at and what his previous visual conceptual experience has taught him to see to see a paradigm is prerequisite to perception itself because it provides the transformation glasses needed to view the world. Inherent bias. Is experienced fixed and neutral with theories being interpretation of specific data. While the answer isn’t no science still forms around the existing paradigm and there are different manipulations and guiding hands. People don’t see things piecemeal but she’s within the context of the entire system. Learning a concept of the world not only tells you what it is ie mama differentiates gender and family as well so it’s a simple concept underlined by a diverse system

    - **Note:** We view the world through our models and these are biased we need to understand these biases. We only see the world through what we can conceptualize. Beliefs are a web
      Paradigms are compression algorithms bias inherent in models.
- Paradigm changes the methods old paradigms can be special cases but not guides. The new paradigm is as much a political movement of as it is a changing a theory and methods which is why the people at the cutting edge are usually the non indoctrinated group with none of their identity tied to the old paradigm and the work and ideas it created. Paradigms create problems and rules to solve these problems. In debates people will highlight the inevitable blind spots of each other’s theories because there cannot be or at least is not yet a grand unifying theory. At the end you need to recognize the problems it creates and the Methods it used to solve these problems will be incomplete so people need to make a values judgement about which problems are more important to persue

    - **Note:** New paradigms come from outside the system. All theories will have issues we need to progress from best explanation to better explanation. Paradigms create mental models for a problem set. Be wary of where the models you’re building break down. Also shows the inertia in past models and identity politics. Innovation creates not solutions but new problems. Verisimilitude and innovation from non conformist rebels.
- To reject a paradigm and not accept another is not viewed as science. During transition the paradigm becomes blurred and the rules for the puzzles people can solve loosen. This period ends with the problem solved under the current rules the problem deemed as too hard or a new paradigm emerges. During the transition the field builds from first principles with new groundwork methods. With paradigms there is liras considering the base arguments it’s predicated on the acceptance of base laws and gives methods to solve issues given blind acceptance of those laws. Paradigms take the same inputs with a different transformation function for a new output

    - **Note:** We perceive the world through our existing paradigms and when there is a shift there must be a set of models that replaces the old. This is the bias inherent in our models and we know they are all fallible so me must replace them with something better. Comp to deutche.
      Paradigm is a shift in our mental models and they must be replaced with something better because all knowledge is fallible
- Failure in existing rules sets the stage for new ones. Once the field agrees there are many anomalies they are willing to tests and establish a new paradigm. Crisis leads to order. If there is not widespread doubt there is not a huge incentive to accept a new paradigm only after crisis is there a huge demand for change. Science creates paradigms that are important and guide to a local optimization then it approaches it doubts emerge a new paradigm emerges in search of a global or at least greater local optimization it builds up until it to is disrupted and the cycle starts anew

    - **Note:** The world needs to be ready for change for it to happen. All our knowledge is fallible and we’re likely trending towards local not global maxima but we need the catalyst to get rid of the old. Knowledge exists at the edge of what we know order and the vast unknown chaos outside of this knowledge either has no reach or is illegible. Knowledge is a cycle of trending towards a local max and then stepping back for a global max
      paradigm --> anomoly --> crisis --> debate --> new paradigm local vs global max
- Discovery is rarely a single person at a single moment but a conceptual development over a longer period of time. Something is discovered over months not instantly and a paradigm is designated as much by the tests and equipment as by theory. People generally take awhile to see change it’s not instant eventually throughout right methods people will recognize it but it’s not an instant process

    - **Note:** Change happens overnight for years. Paradigms are deeply engrained in the culture. This is the same thing as Ethernet. This is a similar definition to how it’s defined in idea lab. When change is realized its already over
      Change is conceptual development of paradigm over time
- Science and paradigms create rules and definitions that people only learn through experiment and create mental models that either consciously or unconsciously guide future research. Experience in problem solving methods leads people in different fields to define the same thing different ie the chemist sees helium as a molecule because of laws he sees but the physicist using his laws does not
    - **Tags:** #mental-models, #perspective-taking, #paradigm-shift, #bias-(inherent-in-models)
    - **Note:** Science creates rules that guide thinking called paradigm which are mental models. All our thinking is biased by these models.
- Paradigms create methods that create puzzles that are the output of the correct application of the puzzles methods. Many things that do not fit the common ideas or systems are viewed as another field or to be studied by philosophers. Paradigms set laws/ rules and boundary’s for science. Create methods and theories that can be put together like a puzzle through research
    - **Tags:** #paradigm-(advance/bound-knowledge)
    - **Note:** Paradigm create the rules and methods to solve problems within a discipline
- A paradigm guides research discovery g truth that could never have been discovered without the systematic methods the paradigm created but eventually it’ll become old and need to be recycled
    - **Tags:** #paradigm-shift, #bias-(inherent-in-models), #mental-models, #what-enables-also-restricts
    - **Note:** Paradigms set the mental models and barriers of the field they enable discovery but also restrict or put up walls. What enables restricts
- Paradigms come out of people’s need to structure and codify things while simplifying or guiding the research. Even if the paradigm is not 100% right it leads people down a reasonable path that has some truth and eventually the world shows other proofs. Eventually after a paradigm is asserted the first principals are assumed. Discovery happens more through error than confusion

    - **Note:** Paradigms while not correct develop a framework for thinking that helps guide people into creating better explanations of the world. If everyone is disoriented nothing can be discovered. These create simplified mental models that we can explore our irreducibly complex world
      Discovery happens more through error than confusion. Need to structure your thinking.
- Reject current model for another incompatible model and this leads to a shift in the problems and problem space and changes standards and the world in which science exists in these changes and controversies are the hallmarks of revolutions. New inventions of theory invalidate past experiments and past facts so to become established they can’t be a small change but a significant one
    - **Tags:** #paradigm-shift, #models-(understand-limits)
    - **Note:** Paradigm shift. Models no longer work need new ones to explore existing problem space better.
- Looking not at the history of science through the building of knowledge over time but through how what was seen as science at that time by the peers of the industry. Normal science is based on the belief that the general model for the world is correct and the work off of that is using that assumption and abstracting further. Any novelty against accepted beliefs is seen as an anomaly and dismissed but because the question being asked need these pieces to get closer to the answer the anomalies will come up again down the line constantly. When the anomalies can’t be discounted they must be accepted and a new basis or model for science is formed

    - **Note:** Science starts with believing the current model or dogma is correct but eventually anomalies pop up and keep popping up to the point where they are ever present and can no longer be ignored and then a new paradigm is enacted. Definition of paradigm shift. Science is not seen as science at the time it's seen as crazy quackery and only becomes science after it becomes accepted.
      We see the world through our models but eventually the holes in our models get too big and we must replace them. Step change vs gradual view of progress.
      We always think we’re right and we’re always proven wrong. That’s the law of humans.
- To discover this research he took an introductory science class for the layman that gave him the outside view when he only took the inside as a physicist seeing this he recognized trends and saw from beginning to end how revolutions end and are formed throughout past history and paradigms Paradigms are universally recognized scientific achievements that for a time provide model problems and solutions to the accepted way of viewing the world Goal of argument is to create a change in the perception and interpretation of familiar data ie accepted in the current scientific order

    - **Note:** Took the inside and the outside view. Paradigms create mental models that we use to solve problems. Saw how paradigms guide thinking and change through time and only by seeing a long survey and getting his head out of the weeds was he able to realize this.
- Science is something that is using experiment and hypothesis to find The truth in their domain. Progresses quickly in its own terms. It’s created through cross disciplinary thinking and becomes emergent and then slowly becomes walled off the the world and towards a local rather than global optimization. A paradigm shift changes the domain completely and progresses away from previous conceptions of the world toward a new paradigm. Progress away from what had worked well but currently doesn’t provide the most accurate model for reality. Even if scientists are atheistic being raised in a monotheistic world grounds there beliefs because it creates a culture of absolutism there is one true creator way of the world and thus there has to be one right theory to rule them all but what if there isn’t and it’s several theories that come together to form a more clear picture

    - **Note:** Science optimizes then shifts to a new paradigm when it can no longer grow anymore within that idea. Bias of a monotheistic culture on groupthink ideas and one right answer when there can be many.
      We trend toward local optimum so we need to shake the snow globe from time to time.
- There is a difference between theory and reality for scientific revolution there is a currently accepted way of the world then some piece of evidence throws that into doubt and is contrary eventually that evidence mounts and there is a crisis in the field then a new theory or basis is discovered that often changes the way the field is thought about fundamentally or creates a new field all together. This cycle from old core ideas to mew ones is a paradigm shift and the key ideas are though of as paradigms. Examples are uncertainty principle special and general relativity on the origin of species. Basically takes well accepted ideas and revolutionizes them. Rejecting one paradigm means accepting another and this is done based on evidence and experiment on the world

    - **Note:** paradigm shifts occur because our knowledge is fallible and eventually something will come up that proves our current thinking wrong. This is first resisted but eventually becomes accepted. We are biased by our models of the world and see everything through the guise of our models. If we don't know the word for it, we can't conceptualize it.
