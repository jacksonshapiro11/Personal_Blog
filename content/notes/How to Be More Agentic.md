- Category: #articles

- Summary: The author talks about how agency is not an inherent trait but something that can be developed over time. By dialing up agency, one can compensate for other areas where they may not be as strong. The author shares various ways to increase agency, such as seeking real feedback, assuming everything is learnable, and crossing the moat of low status. They also emphasize the importance of setting boundaries and not overworking, as burnout can kill creativity and agency.

### Highlights

- In my way of thinking, radical agency is about finding real edges: things you are willing to do that others aren’t, often because they’re annoying or unpleasant. These don’t always surface in awareness to the point one is actually *choosing* -- often they live in a cloud of aversion that strategically obscures the tradeoff.
  The idea of finding real edges, as contrasted with “eking out wins by grinding harder than everyone,” first clicked for me when I started playing poker. Poker in the modern era is an extraordinarily competitive game, and even 8 years ago pros were spending nearly as much time studying as they were playing, using solver models to seek out tiny mathematical advantages. At the same time, a massive edge was available in the form of physical reads, but almost entirely ignored. (I know an example would make this more compelling, but I’m sorry, it’s like explaining a magic trick.)
  Two friends and I maniacally studied reads together, and we all had out-of-distribution results. But when we’d tell other pros what we were doing, the response from most was “nuh-uh, that’s not a thing.” They weren’t willing to consider the possibility that reads were valuable, maybe because they didn’t want to feel obligated to study them.
  All of my agency hacks are kind of like this, in my opinion -- big, glaring edges that people might rather ignore. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmszq1rwv8h54rpaq0bhy1ap))
    - **Note:** agency is finding real edges you exploit not by optimizing but by doing something others wont like taking over a governement
- **Court rejection**
  Ask for things. Ask for things that feel *unreasonable*, to make sure your intuitions about what’s reasonable are accurate (of course, try not to be a jerk in the process). If you’re only asking for things you get, you’re not aiming high enough. Jobs are a great example: Particularly if you’re early in your career, you should aim to get rejected from most things you apply for ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmt09fyd6hhjm3k3tytsb2en))
    - **Note:** court rejection and seek real feedback from others
- What I discovered by casting a wide net was that I have very little ability to predict how useful a call will be in advance. Relevance is easier to predict, but it’s not a very good proxy for usefulness, which is a product of lots of other things including the other person’s enthusiasm and the breadth of their interests. To some extent, the more confident I am that a conversation is relevant, the less likely I am to discover something exciting during it. Nearly all of my most fruitful collaborations over the last 3 years have come out of meetings I booked almost at random. My best conversation last week was with someone where the introducer told me “this person asked for an introduction but I’m not sure it’s a good use of your time.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmszzkrzxq3a6w3rhcmtey6w))

    - **Note:** increase your surface area for luck. The most unexpected things come from areas we never imagined. Be open minded to all interactions
- **Assume everything is learnable**
  Most subject matter is learnable, even stuff that seems really hard. But beyond that, many (most?) traits that people treat as fixed are actually quite malleable if you (1) believe they are and (2) put the same kind of work into learning them as you would anything else ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmt02b73npg8vb90rcn0ap1r))
    - **Note:** everything even fixed traits like confidence charism and warmth are learnable
- **Learn to love the moat of low status**
  The moat of low status is one of my favorite concepts, [courtesy of my husband Sasha](https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/the-moat-of-low-status-68a). The idea is that making changes in your life, especially when learning new skill sets, requires you to cross a moat of low status, a period of time where you are actually bad at the thing or fail to know things that are obvious to other people.
  It’s called a moat both because you can’t just leap to the other side and because it gives anyone who can cross it a real advantage. It’s possible to cross the moat quietly, by not asking questions and not collaborating, but those tradeoffs really nerf learning. “Learn by doing” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmt05q9te5w905jfmf41v5g6))

    - **Note:** When you’re learning something, you have the ability to ask stupid questions
- **Don’t work too hard**
  This might be the most important item on the list. It took me almost 40 years to learn it, because my instinct is to think more hours mean more productivity as long as you’re really *trying* to be productive -- that’s just multiplication, right? No. The reality is that grinding, even if it temporarily increases output, kills creativity and big picture thinking.
  Burnout is the ultimate agency-killer. This is so true that I’ve learned to identify a reduction in agency as one of the first signs of burnout, one that shows up even before I consciously realize what’s happening. A switch flips and I start looking for ways to rule out ideas and actions, to conclude they won’t work or aren’t necessary, rather than chasing better versions.
