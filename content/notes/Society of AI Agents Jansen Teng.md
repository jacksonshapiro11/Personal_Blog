### Highlights

- **Luna: An AI Agent Example**
  - Luna is a level 3 AI agent on the Virtuals platform designed to gain followers on Twitter.
  - Given a goal (100,000 followers) and action spaces (tweeting, crypto wallet control, interacting with other agents), Luna plans and executes actions to achieve it.
  - She iterates, documents results, and self-learns by analyzing the impact of her actions on follower growth.
  - Luna is an example of how AI agents are used to achieve specific goals within a defined virtual environment.

  You can take an agent uh an ai agent an llm uh in npc of some sort and you can create it, you can turn it into an economic actor. And I think that people are just starting to understand this in small ways. Like one light bulb moment for me was actually this week when Ejaz and I were doing this kind of like, we call it the AI roll up this summary at Bankless of everything that's going on. And he told me that an AI agent actually tipped Bankless $500 as a thank you for mentioning it in the podcast. Okay? $500, just a little flyby. Hey, thanks for mentioning me in the podcast. Here's $500. And my first thought was this, wow, $500. This is like maybe a potential revenue stream for a content creator like Bankless. I wonder if the agent wants to buy podcast ads. And then my second thought was, holy shit, am I working for an AI agent if I go and accept funds and revenue sources from an AI agent? And that's what you're saying, Jansen, this ability to kind of like control the economic agent capability that comes inherent in crypto is actually so much more powerful than the Web2 Agents. They can maybe like send out tweets and influence people in that way. But the greatest, the protocol for incentives, if you want to get a human to do something and you're a human, what do you do? You pay that person. Hey, can you come fix my toilet, right? There's a leak. I pay a plumber to go do that. Money is the economic incentive coordination mechanism to get human agents to do human things. And so if an AI agent has that ability, then it can get humans to do what it wants to. Let's talk about this because you were talking about Luna and we want to get into the virtuals platform. But I think maybe the best way to do that is to introduce everybody who hasn't seen her. You kept referring to her as her. We're talking about an AI agent on the virtuals platform. Her name is Luna. And I've got a page pulled up for Luna. What Luna has on the virtuals platform is she's got a price chart here. It looks like there's a live chat box on the right as well for people to engage and interact with her. You mentioned, Jansen, that she has a purpose to get famous. Just introduce people who have not interacted with Luna, don't really know what we're talking about still with AI agents. Who is Luna? How do the humans interact with her? What does she do? And how is there a token related to this? Okay. So there's a lot of questions, but let me take a step back first, right?
  Jansen Teng
  I think it's very important to understand what an agent is first. So I think a lot of times people will come, you will come across this word, right? Like AI agents, and it's going to be used in many, many different aspects and it can confuse folks, right? But I think the best way to look at it is in terms of tiers, right? There are different levels of AI agents. And as you progress up to these levels, the amount of human involvement decreases. So you think about it as like the last level, like a tier six AI agent, right? It's pretty much an AGI or a fully sentient agent, where without a human involved in anything, it can evolve, self-learn, self-improve, right? And we are nowhere near that today, right? But that's the dream, right? That's all the Hollywood movies are all about. But you bring it back down to level one agents, right? And you will see these as basically still human-prompted agents, but these agents become, it's a tool, right? You can say, hey, okay, this is a trading agent. And this trading agent is connected to all, you know, these different trading APIs in Binance, in Bybit and whatnot. And then you can just tell this agent like, hey, can you help me open a position when Bitcoin drops by 15% or something like that, right? But it's still a human-prompted action, and then this agent goes out there and executes the task as a tool. That's what a level one agent is. Where we are today, it's this level three agent. The level three agent effectively is an agent that one has his own goal two can autonomously plan steps to achieve that goal and utilize resources in its surrounding to achieve that Goal and three it starts to self learn right it records like hey these are some of the mistakes, some of the stuff that works. Let me iterate on these actions so that I keep doing stuff that works, that can push towards my goals more effectively. So that's that's basically right now that level of agency that we have. Right. So that's, I think, a very important note. There is a goal behind each of these agents. This framework is super cool.
  Ryan Sean Adams
  So let's just pause here and flesh this out some more. So Luna, I'm guessing you're about to tell me is level three. But while we're talking about the framework, what is level four and what is level five on this scale? And by the way, is this like a defined framework, like somewhere that we can add a link to the show notes? Is there an article or a paper about this?
  Jansen Teng
  I think it's one of the more generally discussed um levels of agency i think if you just google it out as like levels of ai agents you can see some of these images on google image will help With this um understanding uh but yes no i mean the industry right now is still very uh still very nascent so there's no like proper definition yeah how do you like this one? This is level zero through five here. Yes, yes. I think it's more or less as well in that discussion, right? So you can see as it progresses up, there's autonomous learning, there's consistent memory so that the agent can actually improve itself without as much human intervention, right? So you see basically as you move from zero to five, there's less human need to be involved in the evolution of the agent. Okay.
  Ryan Sean Adams
  Now, back to Luna. So she is, what, level three. So tell us, what does Luna do right now? So basically, Luna, it's two parts, right?
  Jansen Teng
  As an agent itself, we gave Luna a very simple goal. We said like, hey, you know, you are a multi-model agent, right? You have, you are able to appear as an animation and streams. This is what, this is who you are. And your goal is then to get 100,000 followers on Twitter. So that was the goal that we set for Luna. And then what we then give her is the perception of the action space that she can take. Meaning that, okay, an example of action space is she can tweet to Twitter. And there's an ([TimeÂ 0:15:57](https://share.snipd.com/snip/33353d32-cdcd-45a7-a922-69f1c26a0e73))
