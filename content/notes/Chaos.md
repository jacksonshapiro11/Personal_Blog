### Highlights

- Simple systems give rise to complex behavior and complex systems give rise to simple behavior the laws of complexity hold universally
    - **Tags:** #simplicity-(power-of), #complex-adaptive-systems
- Studying how biological clocks work through topology and complex dynamics to come up with some theory around biological clocks. Mode locking when a dynamic systems comes together to display a similar behavior or the same behavior and this is stasis on the system how well can control phenomena like this be robust adapt to small jolts that would throw them out of synch and how well can the system function over a range of frequencies. Dynamic systems must respond to changes and this creates fractal structures that are more responsive and adaptive in this face of change. We are a complex system but our medicine targets one area without understanding the greater system so how could it possibly be successful if it doesn’t appreciate the dynamic interactions between the millions of small processes and transmitters in the body

    - **Note:** Dynamic Systems can find a stasis mode where behavior across the system remains robust to changes. When treating a complex system we cannot make a point level change we must make a system level change to create enduring change. Any change in a complex system has a fractal effect. We over optimize for one variable but miss the holistic approach.
- Energy in systems exist in macro scales where things can be counted and measured like a system in classical mechanics and micro scales things like atoms that are unmeasurable except as an average entity like temperature. At the intersection of these 2 where chaos exists is the creation of information. At the pinnacle of complex processes in the world knowledges created. Knowledge stored in protoplasm passed down through the years to humans and other amimal structures likewise in learning humans create mew connections and build new knowledge all of this growth must happen at the edge of chaos because that is where knowledge forms. True random data remains spread out and undefined while chaos deterministic and patterned pulls the data into visible shapes that are generally similar across chaotic systems. Attractors in phase space Fixed points - one point where everything stops Limit cycles - oscillation between points Strange attractors- everything else that exists in phase space chaotic systems in phase space with no equilibrium points but a deeper chaotic structure The lower the fractal dimension the simpler the system so people would search for true lowest fractal dimension

    - **Note:** Knowledge is formed at the intersection of order and chaos between the macro emergent structures and micro interactions between elements of a system. Fractal dimension strange attractors and knowledge creation. Simplicity in complexity seen through lower fractal dimensions is deep universal truth.
      Knowledge creation at the edge of order and chaos
- Realm of physical experience that was non linear and didn’t fit in the goalposts of what was accepted to be taught so it wasn’t even if it was a better model for reality. Take regular physics and take one small step away you get chaotic systems. One should be guided by what you can actually see and model. Spontaneous emergence of self organization. Order with randomness emerging from classical physics vs randomness with order emerging from chaotic patterns and fractal shapes. Sensitive dependence on initial conditions

    - **Note:** chaotic systems are closer to reality than classical systems. The world is more random with areas of order that come from chaotic fractals. Even in these chaotic systems we can find a deeper order. We study a very small subset of the world. In science we create a fake simplistic world when reality is much more complex than that we only study a small set of non real systems
      The world is non linear but we study exclusively linear systems. Linearity is the anomaly study the world as it is not how you want it to be.
- Fractal shapes are the product of deterministic processes but also were the limit of random processes
- Forces that shape life there is the physical cause by gravity and the explanatory cause. A cup is round because it’s the easiest to drink from or the cup is round because that is the natural output of a pottery wheel. Deep seeded forms and universality in natural forms. Dynamic structures. Physical laws explain force and growth but our understanding is just out of reach

    - **Note:** Physical vs explanatory causes. Question why things are a certain way. Some things are physical other are human based some don’t even make sense anymore and don’t serve you.
- Goedtl the perception of color was universal what mathematical formalism corresponds to human interpretation. Human perception going through the Baltic world to find redness. Quadratic different d equation can produce one answer an oscillation or pure chaos even the average value fluctuated unstably. Captures the phenomenonof instability and peculiar outputs of chaos. Showing functions that first went to bifurcation then to disorder all showed this similar scaling law by the same geometric constant like that constant was a fundamental part of scaling these systems and life and chaotic systems. Answers to the functions had nothing to do with equations. His number allowed him to predict when the period doubling would occur. Believed in universal equations that governed these jumps to turbulent systems while these weren’t universally recognized they were in fact rejected these were 1 complex model to rule all scaling in chaotic turbulent systems. Discovered how chaotic systems scale universally. All arts to science are just ways to model the world we live in to give ourselves a better understanding of where and how we live

    - **Note:** Chaotic systems have similar patterns that govern their phase transitions and these can be understood through equations. goedtl disvoered how chaotic systems scale universally. Find universality through equations and how equations dont need to have one answer but can have a few answers. Also equations are reductionist simplification models but also helpful
- In the short term any point in phase space can be used to model a dynamic system but in the long run it tends towards the attractors the global truths signal in noise. In turbulence the cycle would never repeat but continuously go to new areas infinitely long line in a finite area. Attractor for turbulence was stable low dimensional and non periodic oy never repeated or intersected. Strange attractors sources of truth and attraction in dynamic chaotic systems. Where these systems tend to over time

    - **Note:** Eventually things settle down to some static state even if that state is still moving. Dynamic systems have global finite states.
- Structures that were the key to non linear problems were fractal. Each change of scale brought new phenomena. Behavior at small scales do not mirror the behavior at large scales in natural systems a sperm isn’t a small human. Emergent behaviors at different scales versus normal geometry a triangle is the same regardless of size basically. Feeling of beauty is the interplay in order and disorder
- Chaotic patterns in packet switching where you couldn’t model it but you also could regular irregularities. When you make measurements the specificity determine the measurement of you measure a coastline by meters vs feet the number will be different the more specific you get the larger it goes towards an infinite increase as you get microscopic bur there is a ton of regularity in the irregularity of the changes. These fractional measurements and the patterns they created were coined as fractals where there is a repeating pattern forming a shape ad infinitum. Every addition creates infinite length in a finite area. Each transformation increases the area of the curve every transformation in thus scenario replaces 1 1 foot segment with 4 4 inch segments transformation makes the 4/3 trade off infinite length within a finite space. Coach curve. Mandelbrot developed his own intuition and first principles for the world where the non obvious became normal. Fractal meant self similar recursion across scale. Even economic chaotic systems display self similarities in different scales. Fractal data being made observe fractal patterns in all areas of human and natural system. Detail at constant scales patterns on patterns detail at finer scales with constant measurements. Fractals allow you to measure different things in different ways in fractal dimensions the measurements and the distance between things and their transitions are as important as the shapes. Changing fractal dimensions. Contact between surfaces have different properties and depends on the fractal bumps on pumps on bumps whey gaps everywhere at small scales irregular bumps subsist

    - **Note:** Fractals gave a new model for measurement and a new paradigm to see things under. The self similarity of fractals at different levels gave insight into a new way of seeing the world. Fractals are in both physical and social systems. Fractals are the product of matching measurement with non linear reality instead of linear systems that model nothing.
- Modeling populations is dynamic and changes with size so it rises at this speed until it reaches this size and then it declines or stagnates. There was a term to measure non linearity. People want to discover regularities in the world and look to the areas of complexity with answers that behave linearly but we live in a world that behaves non linearly and finding linear systems is an anomaly but we only study them so were blind to the world. What happens when a populations rate of growth passes a critical point where it can no longer be stable but becomes complex and chaotic. Raising non linearity increased chaos the same system will behave very differently at different lambda values. Same system different chaos value wildly different outputs. Even in this chaos there were regular cycles and if you can prove there are cycles of 3s you realize there are cycles of every other degree and completely chaotic cycles too so what seems random is not. Can’t set up a system without the ability for that system to become chaotic at the right level. Chaos is ubiquitous stable and structured. Simple models can produce behavior that looked random but was in fact had an fine real structure that seemed indistinguishable from noise. In theoretical biology data that looked random made sense under chaos things weren’t looked at as static but dynamic systems. The world is apparently random but can actually be described by very simple models and these models transcend fields unified world truths. Simple systems do not have simple properties

    - **Note:** Humans want to make the world easy and legible but the world is far from that. It is a mess of complexity that may reveal a deeper order. Even simple systems with simple rules have complex intractable behavior. Chaos seems disordered but presents order at a different level of emergence. We are so blind to the world because we study linear systems because they are easy to reason but complex systems are non linear and compose most of the world. Most of the world is composed of complex non linear adaptive behavior and systems that can be understood with different types of models.
      People want order but the world is chaos. We want to study linear systems in a non linear world.
- Stability means the behavior of the system wouldn’t change if some number or input was changed slightly standing a pencil on its point is stable but one small change throws it out is wack. If you want a physically realistic and adaptive model to small changes surely you want stability. Chaotic systems could be stable with a pattern of peculiarities. Locally unpredictable globally predictive. Copper atom on the nose. Chaos doesn’t mean unstable can be irregularly stable. A complex system can create coherence and turbulence at the same time
- In adopting a viewpoint you need to accept primitives and biases inherent in those primitive models to actually make progress towards more complex areas of the discipline but if those primitives are wrong the whole field rests on shaky ground. Shallow ideas can be assimilated paradigm changing ideas provoke hostility. Unpredictability and studying chaotic dynamics discovered that disorderly first level behavior was a creator at a higher level of the system generating complexity and order with varying degrees of stability. Creating humans. We can project the movement of a pendulum within a negligible margin of error but over time that error becomes so large that the whole system can no longer be predicted

    - **Note:** Chaotic first level behavior produced orderly and emergent 2nd and 3rd order behavior (ie creativity). When you accept an idea you are accepting all the assumption and biases that come with it. It's easier to acclimate an idea into a paradigm then destroy the existing one. Tearing down the house. Small changes compound into unpredictability.
- Waterwheel lorenzes paper you expect some irregularities but eventually the waterwheel should come to a steady state follow a recurring pattern but small changes in the system created a double spiral like creation where the system never settled to a pattern but instead moved never recurring within bounds of values no order in pattern but in the grand pattern there was order. The idea didn’t think along the lines of classical physics with complexity stripped out but a new model that generalized or abstracted that exhibited behavior that intuitively changed the real world
    - **Tags:** #complex-adaptive-systems, #chaos, #emergent-behavior, #levels-of-emergence
    - **Note:** At a lower level of emergence this is purely chaotic but when you abstract up a layer it becomes more clear there is a pattern. Complex adaptive vs simple systems
- I’m weather prediction a simulation machine was used that output values as prediction and used this to show the development of weather. The output was taken and started from the middle and the values were specific to fewer decimals than the computer this small difference in values caused completely divergent and different results. Small changes in systems compound to bud differences which makes most prediction impossible because of unforeseen exponential effects. Using computers to predict weather is the beginning of using computers to forecast complex systems. Butterfly effect complex systems that seemed chaotic and unpredictable may have had some deep level of order or predictably where you didn’t totally throw your hands up. Systems that are aperiodic apst repeat themselves but never truly do in the same time frame scale and process. A link between aperidocity and unpredictability such that you can build randomness in to your predictions. Sensitive dependence on initial conditions = butterfly effect. Small points of divergent chaos. Chaos with very simple rules. Take initial conditions even small changes can create divergent and wildly different outcomes. Non linearity is messy and hard to deal with we cannot fully appreciate and capture these effects. Behavior of a non linear equation makes prediction harder or unpredictable
- Chaos eliminates deterministic predictability. Applies to our physical universe. Chaos helps to predict emergence. You can predict what one molecule or atom will do but can you predict a complex system of atoms each moving independently.
