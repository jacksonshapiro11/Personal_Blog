### Highlights

- Genuinely new things can come from combinations of old things. What is the essence of creativity. Creativity as something novel with value is new age. Creativity activity is trying to capture how humans exist/act in the world. We can act to the book or we can break the mold in an attempt to gain a deeper understand of the world. The urge to expand develop and mature to expresses and fully realize the capacities of the organism to the extent the activation of these capacities helps the organism or the self humans asserting they aren’t machines. Link between human creativity and consciousness? Creativity is the urge to create and express yourself through your work. Consciousness means humans don’t understand what it’s like to be anyone else so people express through creativity to give others a sense. We provide sympathy with people’s art create a better or different place for the world. Art/creativity is telling a story to prove a thesis. Some of art is ambiguous so even the observers can be creative when interacting with it. The fact that we die leads us to create so we are not lost to the world. Imagining yourself in the thoughts and feelings of others is part of/ core of being human hard to be cruel when you enter the mind of someone else you create the essence of compassion and the beginning of morality. We learn others through creativity

    - **Note:** Creativity is producing something novel and valuable which captures a deeper understanding of how humans exist in the world to help them realize the deeper capacities of humanity we posses. It's expression through work. Creative act and art has a thesis about the world and uses a medium to express it and how others interact with it. We all die so we want to leave a creative legacy.
- Language is interesting because things map weirdly and tricky quirks of grammar that humans understand may take robots much longer. IBM Watson when competing in jeopardy deconstructed clues by word association and arrangement which was very similar to how humans did it and it won but it also came up with very quirky answers. Likewise a robot talking to robot program created complex meaning for spacial words like right and left while further developing a new language even the humans couldn’t understand. Language is confusing because there’s the word and the object language is just a comprehension model so just because you know how to use chair in a sentence you don’t really understand what it is other than a word. Language is just a descriptive model

    - **Note:** Language is a tool to convey meaning. It’s not really needed. Language is an idea of how people think and machines create their own language and communication tools. Deep complexity in models. You can’t name something you can’t conceptualize as existing. Language is a mental model for communication but description isn’t understanding. What a computer sees as a chair isn’t the full understanding of chair.
      Language is a reverse compression algo to understand peoples mental models. Takes mental representation and tries to formalize it through finite words. Semantics vs meaning
      This is definition of memes the action and then the copying mechanism to the word and its physical meaning
      Language reverse compression of memes.
- Math is art there is some deep truth underlying a proof but the way you prove it is the art of it likewise with writing code something can be more beautiful or better or more ugly or worse sub optimal. Like a canvas that doesn’t hold paint is worse than one that persists forever like a program that runs in 2 seconds is better than one that runs forever. Thematically they may do the same thing but one might be better and more beautiful while the other is clunky. Then there is inefficient for inefficiency sake which also poses a question of putting extra complexity into something simple like a chair

    - **Note:** Art and beauty exist everywhere and there is beauty in deep simplicity. There is deep truth and deep beauty in the world. We know something can be more or less beautiful and we abstractly understand the fact that objective beauty can and does exist like objective truth it’s just about finding it.
      Objective beauty exists because we can all agree on some beauty aspects.
- Ai music can be creative but it’s still based on something not that genuine spark but so is everything based on the work of those before so is it truly creative or just locally better at composing than the best composers
- Markov chains obey the law of large numbers but also deterministic and depending on what is around it for example a book is analyzed to be 60% consonants and 40% vowels but deterministically ie after a vowel it is 90% likely to be a consonant and after a consanant and it’s 70% likely to be a vowel so locally it’s predictive but globally all predictions are still equal to the actual probability and thus obey the law of large numbers
  wikipedia definition of markov chain
  A Markov chain or Markov process is **a stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event**. Informally, this may be thought of as, "What happens next depends only on the state of affairs now."

    - **Note:** This shows the interplay between signal and noise between short term and long term. Markov chains lead to more accurate point predictions but globally still obey the law of large numbers. This is an interesting trade off and anomaly of systems
- Build an algorithm that learned based on Bach and other famous composers and this music was indistinguishable or even considered to be more like the original composer than some of the original composers work more human than human and obviously this was based on someone’s work and not genuinely creative but likewise still serves as an amazing creative accomplishment

    - **Note:** What is true human thought and creativity? Creativity in the age of ai
- Alpha go was able to win by considering strategies that were dismissed as wholly wrong by conventional wisdom local vs global maximum

    - **Note:** Ai and computation finds non linear answers to questions. It doesn’t take the best answers and optimizes them but does something so crazy and out there. Humans are finite machines and prune paths well but sometimes they prune them too early and alpha go realized that. Humans don’t have the random compute computers do so they optimize early but also have better algos.
- Exploratory creativity taking current world and going deeper sustaining creativity Combinatory creativity where you take 2 separate ideas and make something new and genuinely creative Transformational creativity phase or step changes in ideas that usher in a new creative paradigm. Drop meta constraints of current paradigms in pursuit of a global maximum. Sometimes this type of creativity is just a function of attention not being paid to the history of the craft only seeing the final product and thinking of the Devine creativity Psychological vs historical creativity a local creative thought that has already been discovered but is new and organic to us or a completely new thing to the entire world but this can come through psychological creativity laying the ground work for future massive changes. Failure is important to creating creativity shots on goal vs success rate power laws

    - **Note:** Creativity is described in 3 ways through abstraction of our current world to connections within our world to step change innovations that step outside the bounds of our current society. Creativity in many ways can be just increasing your learning rate and getting shots on goal.
