### Highlights

- The brown color of UPS apparel was chosen to project humility, a key value of Jim Casey. Sam Walton held a similar value, believing that while ego can drive you, it shouldn't be on display. Ups was a cult like organization. People worked there forever. Missionaries. It took 4 years to become a driver. Started off doing transportation for department stores when people bought more than they could carry. Deep commitment to service. Money comes naturally as the result of service. Rigorous code of ethics and spartan discipline. Jim Casey allowed employees to share in the profits. He was auto didactic and was always learning. When he was at a hotel and saw usps was delivery packages he worked to make sure ups did that. When he’s driving he would pull over and ask workers what they were working on and wanted. Seeing from the front. The greats see from the front.

  A way to project humility, one of Jim Casey's most strongly held values. This is going to echo what Sam Walton taught us a long time ago. Jim valued humility, so did Sam Walton, at least the external appearance of humility. You can have an ego, but what Sam Walton was saying is your ego could drive you, but you don't want to put it on display. He said, I learned a long time ago that exercising your ego in public is definitely not the way to build an effective organization. I think we should listen to him. There's very few people that have built more effective organizations in the history of humanity than Sam Walton. More on Jim's commitment to service, which is repeated over and over again in the book. And this is something, you know, this is foundational to the history of entrepreneurship.

- Jim Casey, UPS founder, was remarkably frugal, a habit from supporting his family of 5 from age 11. He even suggested nighttime phone rates to AT&T, resulting in savings for himself and others constantly thinking. Implemented a decentralized management plan to learn from others no centralized management. He lived a simple life simple office no frills. Hire the best high agency people and move quickly. Money prestige didn’t push him only excellence did. Haven’t a shining star but relentless and beat himself to success. Worked on ups for 76 years did very little else outside of work. Very understated carried the depression with him always. Very ethical mom. His dad is dying from minors lung. He has to get a job goes into deliveries not the mines at 11 working 10 hour days and longer on Saturday to support his family. His younger brother also works. His dad dies at 14. He delivered everything. Jim tried to work the night shift so he could go to school but gave up. He would deliver anything drugs to drug addicts working through the dark and cold. Resented the people who had heat in the lobby on those cold nights. Did everything to be successful.

  Was not expecting. When you pick up the book, I just was not expecting some of the stuff that's in this book. And we'll get there. He always watched where the money went. A habit leftovers from his days of supporting a family of five as an 11-year That's not hyperbolic. That's insane. In the late 1940s, Jim made a friendly suggestion to the president of ATT, which at the time had a monopoly on America's telephones. Noting that the phone lines weren't much used at night, he suggested that AT&T might offer reduced nighttime rates. AT&T implemented the idea and the resulting savings worked well for Frugal Jim and for millions of other Americans. This goes to his own business. He didn't believe in these company palaces. Jim Casey's office was a small stark room occupied only by a metal desk, several chairs and a coat tree. His door was never closed. The minimalism dispelled any customer questions about the fairness of UPS prices. One of my favorite stories to illustrate this. And it's just a way to take this idea, this importance, the importance of this idea and keep it logged in your head forever. Of course, it comes from Charlie Munger. He's touring, I think it's the Buffalo Evening News that him and Warren Buffett had just bought. And he could not believe at the opulence. And he just says, why does a newspaper need a palace to publish in? I love that guy so much. All right. Jim preferred this Spartan business style. They were all owners of the business and almost without exception they preferred greater profits to splurging on frills more on how Jim operates he was he believed in decentralization And empowering the individual. His answers for sluggish layers of management was decentralization. And his attitude towards employees was an unwavering belief in and a respect for the individual. And I got to that part of the book. I want to read this highlight. This comes from Ashley Vance's fantastic book. It was actually the first episode I ever did at Founders. It's on Elon Musk.

- Started a deliver company and one of the founders got murdered so they moved back to Seattle and did the same thing. Started with $100 delivering anything including messages private investigator. Focus on one service to gain expertise. Jim Casey narrowed UPS's focus to delivering retail packages, rejecting diverse errands to enhance proficiency. Focus on delivering department store packages. They expanded through partnerships. Invest in technology. They start with motor cycles and eventually end up going into using trucks. They delivered in bulk. Constantly adapting to changing market demands. Jim expands through hand to hand combat. Going state by state and city by city arguing with the interstate commerce commission to allow them to expand. To expand he uses his stock to buy other distribution companies because he can’t raise money. Took him 68 years to go nationwide. Almost sold but then the depression called off the deal he regretted making the agreement and was happy he got out. Said employee ownership was the most important and the workers from the beginning make 10s of millions. They also competed with he government. In usps.

  He wanted to narrow the focus of the business. And this is where they come up with the ideas like, why don't we just focus on delivering packages from retail stores? So it says, getting fed up with the nature of some of these errands, the young team cast about for a strategy that would add substance to their business. There's a clothing store called King Brothers. They signed on with American Messenger Company, allowing the store to offer customers same day delivery. So this is really interesting, too. I never thought about at this point in American history, a lot of people are living in cities. It's not a lot of cars. And so when you're shopping, you're shopping in like a downtown area, close to where you live, where your apartment is, you don't want to carry all this stuff. So that's how the service starts. Now that's what allows UPS to start building out their business. But eventually, a couple decades in the future, everybody's got a car. There's this huge demographic shift outside of cities into suburbs and into shopping malls. As you can imagine, he ran the company or he was with the company for 70-something years. There's all kinds of different environments that he has to adapt to and to succeed in. And I think I talked about that a little bit later on to packages of clothing purchases arrived at the at their office throughout the day and were dispatched along with messages to the Same neighborhood. Effectively, this consolidation generated far greater revenue from a single trip. So they're delivering packages not just from one clothing store, but as many retailers as they can. And they're ([Time 0:39:56](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3b39096d-13ab-4207-8a59-fe3b35f383a4))
- Disruptive innovation and carelessness from incumbents. FedEx, established in 1973 as an airline, was exempt from common carrier regulations that burdened ground delivery companies like UPS. This legal distinction allowed FedEx to innovate and scale rapidly nationwide with a hub-and-spoke model, while UPS was still expanding city by city. UPS initially ignored and underestimated FedEx, dismissing their innovative air delivery approach and focusing on their existing ground network. This oversight allowed FedEx to gain a significant competitive advantage, capitalizing on the emerging overnight delivery market and disrupting UPS's established business. Over the long term all great companies die so have fun while you’re alive. Transition isn’t easy and easier to see difficulties on the road ahead instead of methods to solving problems. Take sight of the goal then work towards that goal and adjust along the way until you become successful. Then a new dream comes along and wipes out the old. That is the cycle of life.

  FedEx was established in 1973 as an airline, not a ground delivery company, is an important legal distinction because the company was exempt from onerous common carrier regulations. Airlines fall under a different regulatory body, the FAA, not the ICC that regulated trucking companies. So the ICC is what UPS is having to fight. Remember, city by city, state by state. Fred Smith took a completely different approach. Like, I don't have to do any of that. And FedEx didn't intend to start up city by city as UPS always had. The concept was hatched nationwide with its one hub from the very beginning. With these modifications, FedEx revolutionized air delivery. And when UPS leadership got serious about next day air, they did the same thing. But this didn't happen for eight more years. Think about the jump that Fred Smith got on UPS. The vast delivery market that had taken UPS 65 years to accumulate was suddenly jarred by this upstart. Federal Express, a company that no one had ever heard of. Now think about this. Okay, we've seen this example multiple times. What do you think is going to be the reaction inside UPS? It's this huge, already successful company. It's been at the delivery business for multiple decades, its founder is very close to the end of his life, we know how they're going to react. This is very predictable. Most UPSers took the ostrich approach, ignoring the new company. Some denigrated it, saying, for instance, how are they going to deliver them on the ground? Their network's too small. People don't need that much delivered overnight. Costs are too high. They'll probably go out of business. Thousands of UPSers were very busy celebrating their periodic service expansions. They were caught up in following through with all the staffing and planning demanded of opening new territories. We rarely mentioned the new competition. In fact, UPS annual reports of the late 1970s and even 1980 made no mention of FedEx still decrying the post office at its number one competitor. That's not very different from Henry Ford sticking his head in the stand like an ostrich saying nope don't need to improve the Model T all I need to do is keep making more of them lower the Price and that gap that UPS left that eight-year gap Fred Smith drove FedEx right through just like Billy Durant and Alfred Sloan and GM drove through that gap left by Henry Ford. It's the same thing, the same reaction. History doesn't repeat, human nature does. And reading about this and being reminded of this, it just makes me excited. Because just like GM took advantage, just like Fred Smith took advantage. We can take advantage of the gaps left by these other stodgy companies that get comfortable. And I'm going to give you a quote later on about Charlie Munger comparing company behavior to biology. It is entirely predictable and natural outcome of businesses as they age.
