### Highlights

- He needs money and is poor gets a life changing order from Bloomingdale’s and turns it down because he would have to take his brand name off the tie. When the fashion industry got out of the manufacturing business just to design licsencing and marketing. Stick to your circle of competence.
  Ralph grew up poor but he was always going to thrift stores and crafting outfits that would later become his brand. He took many of his greatest ideas from old movies. Brooks brothers was a selling an image and an identity to their customers like an old English lifestyle. He didn’t want to be a designer he just followed his interests and ended up as a designer.

    - **Note:** He was clear about his goals and did what made his beer taste better manufacturing is a whole different skill set and much more of a commodity than designing.
      He followed his natural curiosity and made clothes authentic to him. He had been doing that his whole life now he was getting paid. He had been practicing for this since he was a kid
- Charlie munger find a field where you have intense interest not just kinda interest. Ralph would talk about fashion the way people talked about plays and books.
  His first job was selling gloves. What he lacked in experience he made up for in work ethic and enthusiasm. No one really understood what Ralph wanted to do. Differentiation is survival. A trade paper published a story about his unique style before he even had his own company. Ralph had to be different.
  Mediocrity is invisible until passion exposes it. Ralph would spend hours talking about belt loops. The company he worked for had a founder who loved him but he died and his son in law took over who worked at a business without passion. Ralph realized his creativity was stifled and had to leave.

    - **Note:** Pursue a field of intense interest you can’t fake interest it will be exposed.
      Ralph pursued his unique differentiation and followed his curiosity optimizing for freedom. Deep commitment and understanding of his craft.
- You need to have delusional sense of self confidence. Ralph had such a constant pressure to do what he wanted. His boss was exposed by Ralph’s passion.
  The job of an entrepreneur is the need to sell everyone constantly. When he went I quit his job people said you have a great job why leave for something uncertain. Ralph saw a white space in ties to grow the market with a premium product.
  Ralph had a small brand and needed more exposure. Nothing draws a crowd like a crowd.
  Cold outreach to mens fashion editor at playboys. Ralph turned away business many times unless they did it his way. He cultivated his brand and had a clear strategy. Ralph was a lifestyle brand who marketed clothes for all areas of life. He was the first mens designer. All designers had been for women and men bought from brands. Ralph was different. He needed a store at Bloomingdale’s within the store.

    - **Note:** Ralph had a deep sense of belief in himself and passion. He quit a great job to seize a market opportunity and grew the tie market into a premium product he started with 1 product then built a brand.
      Nothing draws a crowd like a crowd. He cultivated a brand with a clear strategy and his clothes were marketed in all areas of life. He turned down opportunities to sell that weren't under his name even though he needed the money because he needed to own the customer experience not outsource it
- Ralph was a partner with someone in the business but wanted to be independent. He bought out his partner even though he had no money to do so. He invited a finance guy in who realized his company was about to go bankrupt. In manufacturing intense growth can kill your because of cap ex so they get into licensing. Ralph had to step in and be a line of credit for the company because they were on so deep.
  Ralph was winning awards for top design and the next day couldn’t meet payroll. The financial situation was dire. He needed to ask Bloomingdale’s to float money. He had to fire people and almost lost his company there was a mass exodus. In these moments everyone will abandon you. Disaster is inevitable so you need to hold cash to weather the storm. Ralph was over levered and had no credit his fashion was booming but his business was failing. You can make mistakes if you’re efficient or be a genius and lose it all if you’re inefficient.
  Ralph remained constant throughout with a singular vision and focus as trends ebbed and flowed. The greatest asset class is talent.
  All the money is in licensing you just need to control quality. Ralph had soul in the game and never had a plan to do something after this.

    - **Note:** Ralph got into liscensing he had a great product but the manufacturing made it a shitty business he was literally about to die and had to make life and death decisions. Good business with bad structure leads to failure. Ralph never followed trends had soul in the game.
