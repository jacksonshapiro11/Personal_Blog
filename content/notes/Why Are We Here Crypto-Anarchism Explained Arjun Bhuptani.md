### Highlights

- Institutions Inevitably Fail
  Summary:
  Humanity's attempt to build effective institutions often results in failure, reflecting an inherent flaw in the human condition.
  This pattern leads to a consistent breakdown of institutions designed to produce necessary goods for survival. The development cycle of products shows that innovations start as breakthrough concepts but typically degrade into public goods or utility status over time.
  Most innovations can be charted along this lifecycle, illustrating the inevitable transition from highly specialized products, like fusion reactors, to commonly accessible resources.

  I've never actually gotten anyone that has given me a real answer. That's really bleak, right? There's something inherent to humanity. There's something inherent to the human condition that leads us to continually get to this output, which is every single time we try to build an institution, it breaks. And when we rely on these institutions to create goods for us, right, any sort of output that we need in order to survive as a species, those goods are themselves broken. Why does that happen? So there's this really interesting notion in kind of economics that talks about the way that goods are developed. And so goods, and this by this, I mean really like any kind of product, any kind of innovation, follows a fairly predictable life cycle going from being breakthrough innovation and Then over time, over the course of innovation, over the course of competition, getting to the point where they're just complete public goods, effectively utilities. You can map out most innovations in this kind of a chart today. So all the way on this end, you have fusion reactors, which are this really, really highly custom thing today. We don't have fusion reactors in our home. You can't buy a fusion reactor on Amazon. ([Time 0:10:23](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a5e63d29-65b9-4571-868e-e4713d92c45f))
    - **Note:** Innovations and coordination have never scaled. We can coordinate in a community but not much wider. The other scaling strategies authorianism or privatization don’t work because of bad incentives
- Monopolies Breed Authoritarianism
  Summary:
  High transaction fees and limited competition in industries like payment processing and health insurance illustrate the consequences of monopolistic practices supported by regulatory systems.
  Incumbent corporations collaborate with politicians to maintain their positions of power, creating a cycle where policies protect these entities, which in turn strengthens their monopolies. This leads to increased authoritarianism and a reduction in civil liberties over time, often only curtailed by revolutions.
  Anarchism, misrepresented by popular culture, fundamentally advocates for dismantling oppressive power structures, with a focus on peer-to-peer technology and decentralized systems.
  Crypto-anarchism represents a methodology for challenging monopolies and promoting decentralization, enabling competition without reliance on traditional governance models.
  The push for decentralization democratizes power, disrupts existing monopolistic trends, and protects civil liberties, framing this movement as a form of political protest and rebellion against age-old systematic oppression.

  They really should be commoditized, right? Visa charges anywhere between 30 basis points to several percent on making transactions. That's a fee rate that is honestly way too high for the world that we live in today. It doesn't really make any sense. But they stay there. They don't move towards becoming a utility. And this is somewhat intentional. Critical to this pattern, to this life cycle of goods, is that when companies are creating goods, when governments are creating goods, they don't necessarily want these goods to become Utilities. They don't want every good to become a utility, and they want to limit the ability for their good to become, effectively get disrupted as a result of moving further along in this timeline. So for payments, that means working with governments to regulate who has access to payments, requiring KYC, things like that, basically making it impossible for new entrants to come Into the market to disrupt Visa and MasterCard. This is a strategy that you see everywhere. Health insurance in the U.S. Is a really great example of this. Health insurance should be commoditized. It doesn't really make sense that it's not. But in the U.S., it is not a commodity good. It's a product. And you pay for it like a product. It is much more expensive than many, many other parts of the world. And the evidence that it's a product is just you can kind of see the distribution of health insurance providers. This is not what a commodity good looks like. A commodity good is way more fragmented. And that's a good thing. That's how you drive prices down. That's how you actually create competition. There is not competition here. Why isn't there competition? Honestly, because of a broken system. To effectively basically keep themselves in power, usually at the cost of users. There's a flywheel that kind of represents how this happens. You have incumbent corporations will fund politicians. Those politicians will be elected and they'll go and pass policy. And the policy that they pass will protect the donors that funded them. Once they pass that policy, those corporations will solidify their monopolies, grow revenue, and become basically super, super dominant. And then they'll partner back with the governments to give them technology dominance, right? So governments will then leverage the exact same technology, example, Twitter, to control people's opinions, to control the way that they think, and to then fund more politicians And kind of go around in this cycle, where of course, unfortunately, you are the one that's losing. We talk so much about incentives in this space, and that's such a core part of the way that we think about blockchains, about building infrastructure. But there's also a similar kind of system of incentives that exists around governance right now, around policy. And regardless of whether you fall into the economic right or left, the system of incentives, unfortunately, continues to drive us upwards, which is no matter what happens every single Cycle, we get more and more authoritarian, right? Even if you even I mean, we'll see kind of what happens with this presidency. But even when you when you have net reductions in complexity of legal systems, we have not yet seen a net reduction in authoritarianism. We have only seen the slow and gradual reduction in civil liberties over time. And in history, the only instances where that's changed is when you have a revolution. So hopefully we don't have to hit that point. What we do need is ideally something that is not a revolution, but something that pulls us strongly in the other direction towards anarchism. Now, I'm sure the word anarchism makes people a little uncomfy. It makes me a little uncomfy, right? There's a lot of brainwashing around anarchism where, like, the first thing I think of when someone says anarchism is, like, cars on fire, right? Like, that is the first mental image that you have. That's not actually what anarchism is at all. It's just like the association that has been drawn, where you're just like, okay, it's a person in all black that is like throwing a Molotov cocktail. But it's not that. It's this much more simple notion that actually, when you go and talk to anybody, regardless of where they're from, regardless of the political backgrounds, when you go and you talk To anybody about this idea, and you talk about, hey, what do you feel about trying to dismantle some of the problematic systems that kind of govern the world that we live in today? I have yet to meet anybody that's like, no, I think that's a bad idea. And this is what's kind of important, right? It's like anarchism is not this notion of like no rules. It's this notion of no rulers. It's not a end state. It's a methodology. And crypto anarchism is Crypto-anarchism is an extension of that methodology. Now, this isn't exactly the definition, but this is my definition, and it's my talk, so I can give a definition. My definition of crypto-anarchism is this notion of working to dismantle oppressive systems of power and replace them with technology where enforcement can happen peer-to Technology That we now know exists that lets us fix things like the tragedy of the commons, that lets us build these socially scalable systems that have never existed before where no one needs to Police them. Where we don't have Watchmen, right? Where the Watchmen are every person that is running an Ethereum node, which is a completely different paradigm. It's the first time in human history that we've ever had the ability to create these kinds of systems. Where the cost of policing them, the cost of operating them is near zero, and where they're fundamentally untamperable. So if we all share this belief that we can use cryptography, we can use technology, we can use incentives to build these kinds of systems, then that means you are also probably a crypto Anarchist. You should cheer. Yeah, absolutely. Because honestly, when it comes down to it, decentralization is anarchism, right? That's what it means. You're taking away power from a bunch of centralized entities. You're breaking up monopolies. You're breaking up these oppressive systems. That is decentralization. Cryptoanarchism breaks this spiral that we have been locked into. And it does it in this, it's honestly in a way that is effectively political protest, right? Even though we may not think about it that way, even though we are all, to an extent, also working to build like businesses or something that kind of looks like businesses, effectively What we're doing by disrupting these organizations, by kind of resisting against these existing systems, is protest, right? It's a form of rebellion against this cycle that we have been trapped in, really, for all of human history. And the way that this happens ([Time 0:13:00](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8e7169c0-dea2-4b6b-8a2e-0ec40a9cd657))
    - **Note:** Policy resistance in systems. Anarchism. Crypto ancharism. Crypto makes everything a utility. One roll up or bridge turns into thousands. Does this make it a bad investment though?
