### Highlights

- Actors face the demanding task of learning their lines with great precision, but they rarely do so by rote repetition. They did not, they said, sit down with a script and recite their lines until they knew them by heart. Repeating items over and over, called *maintenance rehearsal*, is not the most effective strategy for remembering. Instead, actors engage in *elaborative rehearsal*, focusing their attention on the meaning of the material and associating it with information they already know. Actors study the script, trying to understand their character and seeing how their lines relate to that character. In describing these elaborative processes, the actors assembled that evening offered sound advice for effective remembering.

    - **Note:** Instead of rote memorization they learn the meaning understand the system which makes learning the lines easier. Learn the system not the point.
