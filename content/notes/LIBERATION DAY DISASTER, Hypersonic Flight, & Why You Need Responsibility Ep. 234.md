  This so this was um sean johnson on twitter saying perhaps the best definition of masculinity i've ever read and i'll read it out it's pretty quick here's the one thing that movies and Tvs will never tell about masculinity, but you need to learn it. A man achieves happiness in life by delivering on his responsibilities. You have no idea how important this one thing will be to your mental health, your sense of self-worth, your relationships, and your ability to find meaning and purpose in your life. Shout out millennials. I'm talking about your responsibilities to your family, your colleagues, your teammates, your friends, your communities and groups, your country, and even to total strangers. Yes, you have responsibilities to them too. But above all, I'm talking about your responsibilities to yourself. And when I say you owe something to yourself, I mean your higher image of who you should be. Living up to these demands is what makes a man happy. It's also what makes him manly. A real man goes out into the world and gets things done in order to fulfill these obligations. And this is where traditional masculine values come in. Toughness, perseverance, endurance, vitality, ruggedness, and all the rest. If you figure this out, everything else will fall into place.
