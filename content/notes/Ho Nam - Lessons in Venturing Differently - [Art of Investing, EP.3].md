    - **Note:** You need to work at something for awhile to continue to compound your advantage. Cultivate organic growth and networks. Something has to work at a smaller level be capital efficient then you scale that to bigger success. Start small and scale be capitally efficient first don’t lose then win.
      Hedgehog vs fox. Hedgehogs go incredibly deep you can’t compete with them they’re doing something they love.
      You need to build your own path and blaze it you can’t live anyones life but your make it authentically you.
- Thinking Long Term and the Consequences of Our Actions
  Key takeaways:
  - Compounding effects in life are similar to karma, with small actions having ripple effects in the long term.
  - It is important to be thoughtful and consider the consequences of our actions, as they can have massive impacts.
  - Looking back, we may realize that seemingly insignificant things or controversial choices actually benefited us in the long run.
  - Focusing on doing the right thing and considering the long term increases the probability of success.
  - However, life is unpredictable, and there are no guarantees of success even with all the right actions.

  And I took all the advanced math classes from Andover. And so that is sliding doors moment. Because if I hadn't somehow, of course, coming to the US is a sliding doors moment, if I hadn't kind of randomly gone to this mini magnet program, I never would have heard about this boarding School. And I didn't apply to any other school. I didn't know that there was another school called Exeter or whatever. Like, I didn't know about any of these things. I'm just a scholarship kid from East LA. But I thought, wow, this must be a really good school. The John F Kennedy Junior went there and all these past presidents, the bushes all went there. It's like, must be pretty good. Anyway, many sliding door moments, just random things. And again, this gets back at compounding. Because I think about compounding as I was trying to explain it the other day, it's sort of like karma. There are ripple effects. People talk about butterfly effects. There are little things that happen in life that you do that people do that have these ripple effects downstream. And if you're thinking long term, you got to think about the consequences of all these little actions that you might take. And the consequences are massive. And so you should be really thoughtful. And you look back on your life and you're so grateful and so many little things, so many different ways that people helped you or random things that you did that looked like it's genius Now. But it was definitely not genius back then, maybe even controversial. But you're trying to do the right thing with the long term in mind. And if you keep trying to do the right thing, hopefully things will work out. But if you're not even trying to do the right thing, and if you're not even thinking about the long term, then the probability of things working out for you in the long term is just lower. Maybe by random chance, you might do well. But life is hard. There are no guarantees of success. You're up in the cold. You could do all the right things. There are absolutely no guarantees of success. And so it is just what it is. So if you're not even trying to do the right things, the odds of success are just that much lower.
  Speaker 2
  So can we go back to the example set by your parents just when they got to the states? I assume the broker shop and corner store were not venture backed initiatives. They were bootstrapped. There might be the first example for you on the importance of capital efficiency and not running out of cash. But maybe just talk about how seeing them and their approach to work, how that shaped your understanding of work in general. And then over time, maybe even influenced the kind of investor you are. ([Time 0:08:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/174336c9-d53e-485e-a698-931f0ac72891))
    - **Note:** Try to do the right thing over the long term
      Is your only shot at success. Dad was deeply driven and came to the us from success in Korea to be poor but he was driven and cultivated relationships. Continue to learn and live for something beyond yourself. Constant hard work innately in everything and doing so in a way that follows your curiosity. Find tbd purpose of life that drives you and keeps you going bigger than yourself.
- The Importance of Relevance
  Key takeaways:
  - Interesting and relevant companies attract attention
  - People seek out companies, not individuals
  - As companies become more successful, they attract investors from around the world
  - Building quality businesses leads to organic growth of networks
  - Lessons in hoarding relationships and experiences
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  But what we realized was if we have interesting companies, relevant companies, people come seek us out. They want to talk to us for whatever reason, because not because they want to talk to us, but they want to talk to our company. When they realize they're poking around the company, it's like, well, if you want to get to them, you should talk to all those guys. It's like, Oh, okay. So somehow they make their way over in something like Korea, which is the flyover states in the Midwest, you have the flyover countries Korea, like they were all flying over Korea to Go to India and to go to China. But once our companies got to a certain scale and certain relevance, people started to fly into Korea. We didn't have to actually fly our entrepreneurs to Silicon Valley to meet all these VCs. They were flying there, investors from Europe flew there. And from China and from Russia, even from India flew into Korea to meet some of our companies. They get curious. Some of them are flying with their fancy private jets and so on. And it's like, Oh, that's interesting. So we kind of learned that we just kind of do our own thing, take care of our own businesses. And the networks just keep growing. If we do a good job building quality businesses.
  Speaker 3
  Let's just take a moment to think about you're revealing the lessons from your father, hoarding relationships, experiences, ideas. There's so many rabbit holes we can get down, but we need to just spend a moment on two big influences. ([Time 0:37:59](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a5fdbb98-d977-4bba-843c-d22010c043a6))
    - **Note:** Do the right thing and the score takes care of itself. They went through dot com and gfc barely made it through with a differentiated approach. Patience and capital efficiency is key in all investing including venture. Not worried about growth rate but growth engine.
- Differentiation Across Traditional VC Landscape: Patience and Capital Efficiency in Venture Capital
  Key takeaways:
  - Patience and capital efficiency are critical factors in compounding value in venture capital.
  - VCs often overlook patience and capital efficiency, focusing more on the size of the opportunity and the speed of growth.
  - Building a great company with smart management and sustainable advantages is essential for long-term value creation.
  - Capital efficiency is relevant because substantial additional funding requirements can lower the compounding rate of shareholder value.
  - Helping companies become profitable quickly allows for more patience and higher rates of return.
  - Altos places less emphasis on conventional VC metrics and focuses on sustainable growth and survival.
  - Self-actualization in the business process requires time, survival, reliance on others' goodwill, and good luck.

  Speaker 2
  I want to just read from one of those early blogs because it does highlight I think some of the elements of differentiation across the traditional VC landscape and this comes from compounding Value in venture capital. To compound value in venture capital, two critical factors to remember are patience and capital efficiency. These factors are often overlooked by VCs who seem to care more about other issues. They ask, how big is the opportunity? It must have home run potential or how quickly can they get there? The company should have 100 million in revenue potential within five years. And how much money can be put to work? Bigger funds must deploy more capital per deal or end up with too many deals. Why is patience relevant to the discussion on compounding? Because time is required for the compounding to take effect. In Silicon Valley VCs, as well as entrepreneurs, want very fast growth rates, 100% per year or more. In contrast, we'd rather focus on building a growth engine, which can last a very long time. The only way this can happen is if we build a great company, one with smart, responsible management, sustainable competitive advantages, and a commitment to creating long-term value. There are no shortcuts. Perhaps the above point is totally obvious, but why is capital efficiency relevant? After we make an investment if substantial amounts of additional funding are required to grow, then over time, the compounding rate of shareholder value will be far lower. Myron Scholz's equation showed that death and taxes are certain enemies of compounding. So is dilution. Capital efficiency and patience are inextricably linked. Over the years, we've learned that if we help our companies become profitable quickly, we can afford to be more patient. In contrast, companies which burn through lots of capital or play venture lotto produce far lower rates of return or fail in spectacular fashion. In Altos, we place less emphasis on 100% growth or conventional VC metrics, like 100 million revenue in five years. We've seen thousands of business plans with such projections. It's like they were cut and pasted from the same VC 101 business plan. And I think one of the important lessons here to underscore is coming back to this process of self-actualization. You have to be able to survive, to give yourself the time to do this. And that was obviously critical. And in some cases, you need to rely on the goodwill of others and just plain old fashioned good luck. ([Time 1:00:38](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f0708af6-292a-48ef-b3cb-6523818ddde0))
    - **Note:** Building long term company with growth engine and capital efficiency. Be patient and get to profitability. Long term value no short cuts. Dilution hurts your revenue. First don’t die then win. Great companies constantly hit and exceed plan. Great companies are obvious.
- The Hedgehog Concept: Staying Grounded and Focused
  Key takeaways:
  - The hedgehog concept emphasizes focusing on one big thing
  - Hedgehogs stay in tune with reality and prioritize survival
  - Hedgehogs have a humble mindset and know what they know and what they don't
  - Hedgehogs build deep knowledge on a solid foundation
  - Hedgehogs are highly curious and continuous learners
  - Hedgehogs don't care about others' opinions and stay focused on their own work

  Speaker 3
  Well, I think this is the appropriate moment for the unveiling of the hedgehog concept. We were talking to David Senra about our time with you. And he said, guys, just pencils down. If you can just do one thing for a couple hours with ho, talk about the hedgehog concept. There's a lot more to get into, but we do need to spend time here. And I just want to read one passage. And there were a couple people before you ho that talked about the hedgehog, you have the ancient Greek poet, Arkelocus 2500 years ago, who said a Fox knows many things, but a hedgehog Knows one big thing. And then earlier in the 20th century, Isaiah Berlin, and a landmark essay, the hedgehog in the Fox talks about the concept. But what those two don't have is the Radley Prize from Harvey Mudd. And they might have said it first, but I think you said it best across a lot of your blog posts, a lot of your talks, and of course you're implementing this in your own life. But I just wanted to read a very short passage from Focus on the Controlables, which we found on your website. And you say hedgehogs keep their noses to the ground. They stay in tune with reality because it's a matter of survival. They do learn along the way. They do adapt, but they don't dart around, like those quick and clever foxes. Hedgehogs know what they know, which is not a lot. And they know what they don't know. They know that there are always things that are beyond their knowledge and control, like luck, yet they keep moving forward. We just went through a lot of hardships, a lot of learnings that you and Han and team went through. What brought forth this idea of the hedgehog? How would you continue beyond that quote to just put in perspective as it relates to altoes and venture and investing in general?
  Speaker 1
  When I was writing about the hedgehogs, I was like one of those guys. I think I said it was Tolstoy. He admired the hedgehog, but he was not himself a hedgehog. So I was like Tolstoy. I admired the hedgehog, but I was not a hedgehog. I was more like the fox, the hoarder of ideas and so many different ideas and so many different things. But in studying, again, the great entrepreneurs and great businesses, my partner, Han, he is a hedgehog. He's like the hedgehog. And the hedgehog, again, doesn't know a lot of things. They know what they know and they know what they don't know. There's a humility about them, but what they know, they really know. The Google interviews, I've never interviewed at Google, but the Google interviews, they ask you, just tell me about something that you know, you double click. If you play musical instrument, like, just talk about that. How does it work? And you play the violin and you string the vibrates and creates the sound. It's like, how does that work? Are you curious? Did you dive in, right? Or Feynman talking about, you know, that's a rose. So you think you know what a rose is, but you just know the name. You really know nothing about the rose. But if you dig in and it's like, well, what is a rose and you examine the rose and you understand what that is all about and how it grows and where it comes from and how all of that works, then You actually understand how the universe works. So the hedgehog is just somebody who really goes very deep and really builds knowledge on an amazing solid foundation. I think they're just the most fascinating people in the world, but they really don't give a crap about your thing or what somebody else thinks or what somebody else is doing or what's Hot and what's not and what's going on and going to these cocktail parties and these fundraisers and whatever it is. They really could not give a shit. All they care about is the thing that they were doing and they just keep doing it. And everybody thinks that what they're doing is really dumb. They really don't care. They're just going to keep doing it. They're learning machines too. They are absolute learning machines. They learn and they learn because they're curious. They're just really, really curious. And I remember these stories about Sam Walton and these people from Brazil. I think maybe they were the people related to the 3G capital because they have these retailers. Maybe that's how he met the 3G capital guys and they would visit from Brazil and they wanted to learn from this guy. And he's like, oh sure, come along. And Sam Walton is so damn savvy. He sits there and he doesn't give him any of his secrets. ([Time 1:05:22](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1608b2c3-3313-4100-b1e0-55c114eec07b))
    - **Note:** Hedge hogs are very focused and go very deep on a subject while foxes go wide. Hedgehog you know somethings very deep and others not at all but you admit you know what you don’t know and are humble about it. How deeply do you understand your subject matter and how deep they go on ideas thibk feynman talking about magnets and how deep he goes to understand something so completely and deeply. Learning machines and don’t care about what they don’t care about deep focus. Curious and always learning to serve their life’s work. Grit is vital. Deep value investing is about digging deep and uncovering unique and valuable insights from understanding the company so well. Deep value = deep insights. Real due Dillagance process happens after investment. Management is capital and resource allocation. You can’t control anyone you need to build relationships and trust. Partner with independent thinkers who are strong willed. Lean into being yourself forget about what’s hot and build something unique to you. Pursue what you want in your heart and soul conviction over convention.

  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And the Will Thorndype book is full of these capital allocators. And our best CEOs will become amazing capital allocators over time because that's the only way you're going to get this compounding over years and decades.
  Speaker 2
  Yeah, we've had a chance to get to know several entrepreneurs that are backed by Altos. And one of the things that really stands out is the way that you involve yourself and the way that you mentor and support these companies is almost entirely based on earning that right To influence how these teams and these entrepreneurs think as opposed to attempting to control the situation. I mean, I've heard of many examples where you actually decline board seats or push away those traditional control mechanisms. But it really ultimately seems to come down to this more basic concept of building trust with people. In many cases, building deep friendships with these people. Then because of that being in a position to be alongside them in the good times in the bad.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, of course, anybody who's had children, they figure that out real fast. You can't control anybody, including your own children. What you have to do is focus on the relationship and you have a relationship and trust. Then you have the potential to have some influence. And that matters to us way more than the board seat. And of course, we care about ownership. We want skin in the game. We want our interest to be aligned. But that relationship is what we care about, not the board seat. And certainly don't care about control. You know, even Buffett, Buffett says, Oh, they don't listen to me anyway. Talking about the CEOs, really the CEOs, they don't even listen to Buffett, the world's most famous, most successful investor. And so we like to partner with people who are very, very strong willed. And they're going to make up their own damn minds and they're going to do their own thing. And we want to partner with those people. And so we don't want people to come to us. Well, what do you think? And if founders are doing everything that we think is the right thing, it's like we get really nervous. We like independent thinkers. And we're there. And we have our own opinions too. And sometimes we'll disagree, but we'll debate and we'll talk it over. And sometimes they listen to us. Sometimes they don't. And sometimes if they're really good people, like in hindsight, we're like, Oh my God, thank goodness they didn't listen to us. But we learn from them, they learn from us. It's a process. It's a journey we've gone together. You could never, of course, force anybody to love you. It's just got to be a relationship. But over time, again, these relationships have a way of growing and compounding. And if our little universe keeps growing, that's great. But it's just our universe that I could only take care of our own little universe of people and companies.
  Speaker 2
  I love the advice that you continue to give to entrepreneurs to just kind of lean in to becoming themselves and thinking for themselves and being different. This is from raising sheep. You say, if you want to be an entrepreneur, just remember this, follow a different path, your own path. The most successful entrepreneurs win with or without VC funding. They go out and just do it. Forget about the cocktail parties, the hot sectors, hot deals, or what's popular with investors or anyone else. Think for yourself. If you do, you just might come up with something that you will pursue with all your heart and soul conviction. Conviction rather than convention is the key. Obviously, that's led to some tremendous outcomes for the companies you support and ultimately for your LPs and for Altos at large, but it also just strikes me that it just seems like So consistent with the broader human condition for each of us. If as an investor, you really view yourself as form of support for others who are seeking to build and that you are reinforcing them on their journey to self discovery, it just seems like A very powerful point of differentiation that you yourself have carved out in this wild world of investing where usually that is not the common approach.
  Speaker 1
  It's something that I've been on that journey myself and I've seen other people and what I say is people who are on that journey and I call it the spiritual journey. If you're on that journey and you're on this long path, once in a while, you meet people who are joining you on that journey and they recognize each other and they're like, yeah, you're On the same journey. David Senra actually said something remarkable in his most recent podcast. I can't remember exactly the words, but again, I characterize it as the spiritual journey. But Patrick asked him, we read all these different biographies and all these amazing founders, these entrepreneurs. What ties them all together? What's the thing that ties them all together? He said something, it's all been about self discovery and learning about themselves and then they get to a point of like they really do know themselves and this point of conviction and From that point on, they know where to go and they move forward. We have this amazing privilege as venture capitalists to get a chance to explore these relationships and these businesses fairly early on, that's the job. It's like, wow, people are giving us money to invest in these people and we get to have this amazing privilege of getting to know these people and helping them do their life's work ([Time 1:35:19](https://share.snipd.com/snip/41fb303b-d49e-4ad3-8a19-cd7fd1588282))
    - **Note:** You can’t control anyone you need to build relationships and trust. Partner with independent thinkers who are strong willed. Lean into being yourself forget about what’s hot and build something unique to you. Pursue what you want in your heart and soul conviction over convention. Spiritual journey in life giant path of self discovery and moving forward.
