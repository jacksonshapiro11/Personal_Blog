### Highlights

- The Endless Source of Fuel: Motivation and Obsession
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I don't see that in the people that I work with, but I imagine maybe it's out there. I have not seen that. So I mean, I think that the challenge with the people that I've worked with is that they'll reach a certain point and I see this perhaps with people who get these large offers and they turn them down, right? They think I'm capable of more. I think one of the primary reasons that people engage with me to begin with is that deep down, they feel just like probably anyone else sitting in your audience probably feels like, hey, I'm capable of more than where I'm at. And so they're on a mission to really actualize that drive. And when they reach a certain point, their companies are large, their state of affairs is fairly envious. I don't think that that goes away. And currently, I even have someone that I work with and it's like a very large kind of family business. And the gentleman who is a chairperson is, I want to say he's in his mid 70s or so. And man, that guy is hungry as ever, even though he's just advising and he's a, but he is engaged. And you see that with Warren Buffett, you see it with others, like they just kind of don't lose that. And that's where I see, you know, when you talk about motivation, that's a poll that just it is an endless source of fuel. And then when you tie that with something you're like obsessed by, you know, the researcher who can be in a lab and look at a peptide for 20 years, you know, it's just something that is very, very challenging to beat. And I think that's what really creates a lot of, you know, elite operators, because, you know, you can be interested casually in something, ([Time 0:10:36](https://share.snipd.com/snip/971ad601-cce5-48f6-815c-59e4f04cde39))
    - **Note:** The power of discipline which is a pull and drive which is a push. You can grit through some pulls but ultimately you need to align yourself with pushes to make life more enjoyable and successful. Having that strong internal drive is key to push you forward to success. We need to take agency and ownership there are key moments in our lives when we can choose to live it or let it happen to us. We can go to the past for excesses or own the moment. What you choose to give power to is key because at some point it’s in your to take agency and move on. Negative motivation can create fire as much as positive motivation just more dangerous. The little moments define our lives and we make micro choices that have a big say over our larger happiness we need to be mindful of these constant moments when we have agency to shape our days and lives and be proactive.
- The Importance of the Right Social Circle and Seeking Validation
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I agree. And, you know, you hear people say, you know, screw at everyone thinks, right? And I think that that's, you know, that's a quick way to become a jerk because you don't want to do that. You want to care what some people think. And so you want to care what people think who are maybe, you know, your spouse or your children or, you know, some people around you. But that's where I think your social circle really matters because, you know, these people are going to reinforce certain imaginary rules that will, or they'll help you break them. They'll say, hey, you're worth more than that. Why are you putting up with that at work? Or they'll say, man, yeah, we all got to deal with these terrible bosses and like, we're all in it together. And those are very different groups of friends, right? I mean, there'll be people who are cheering you on to start something new or maybe pushing you to start something new. And then there are the people who say, I wouldn't risk it. Like, why do you want to do that? You know, so these are people who like, the people that surround you are going to really be important in, you know, how you think about those as well. So seeking validation, I think is normal and is natural. I think being in a, you know, social media world makes that really challenging. And I think that that makes that hard for a lot of people being able to establish boundaries around that. But I think also boundaries are very confusing, generally for people, right? Like, how do you set the line on a lot of things in your life? But yeah, seeking validation, I think can really be a double edged sword. I think that we should seek it from the right people in our lives. But we certainly don't want to be seeking it outside of that. And I guess I'm of the belief that that circle of seeking validation should be incredibly small. ([Time 0:29:23](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2e41008e-c53f-4781-a396-cdd056e9aff0))
    - **Note:** Imaginary rules are the stories we tell ourselves about what we are and what we do or can do. These shape our world view and are informed by our relationships and we should align our relationships with imaginary rules that reinforce our thick desires. If you hate your job people can say to start something or everyone hates it tough it out. Divergent thinking willing to be an outlier and burn the boats to be successful they don’t care as much as what others think. Benefits of building the foundation of your life many legs of the stool so you’re not over levered to one area like work or a job. Setting boundaries is key because they free you by defining what you can and can’t do it’s guiding to you ri what you should be doing. It’s easy to do everything but this leads to creep in other parts like health that bleeds through so it all together is much worse.
- The Power of Full Focus and Taking Risks

  Speaker 2
  I think part of the enjoyment and correct me if I'm wrong is that you go all in on something. So you're sort of like you've burned the ships, you've landed on the island, you've made a bet, and you've had the courage to take that risk. And then you've cut off all of your exit paths. And my theory on this is that that forces 100% focus. And we can do amazing things when we're fully focused on one thing.
  Speaker 1
  I think that there's there's a truth and a non truth in that if I can push back on some of it. So I think that like there's a truth in that there's a lot of power in focusing on one thing. I don't think that they see themselves burning boats because I think that they see that no matter what happens, they'll figure it out. I don't think that they're going to say, like, Oh, I'm going to lose at all. If this happens, I think they'll say, well, I'll figure out another way, right? Like, and I think that that is a common trait that they'll say, there's not just confidence in taking on the task. There's confidence that like, no matter what happens in uncertainty, that they'll figure it out. And a lot of times, they're often people who are learning new skills all the time. So I don't think the boats are always ever entirely burned. ([Time 0:41:46](https://share.snipd.com/snip/dfc047c8-40d9-4d28-b013-21a9806d630f))
    - **Note:** Outliers are willing to mold to different groups but ultimately be 100% themselves and not afraid to bet bud and put themselves on the edge of failure and success because they have supreme confidence in their abilities and always learning so they believe they can figure anything out. Link between hesitancy and self esteem.
- The Link Between Hesitancy and Self Esteem
  Key takeaways:
  - There is a strong link between hesitancy and self esteem.
  - Hesitancy can erode confidence over time.
  - Taking action and making moves can boost confidence.
  - Confidence builds as you continue to take risks.
  - Hesitancy can create a negative loop and hinder progress.
  - Avoiding taking chances can lead to missed opportunities.
  - Rationalizing inaction can prevent you from pursuing dreams.

  Speaker 1
  Yeah, I think that there is a very strong link more than we think with like hesitancy and self esteem. So for example, I think the more you hesitate, you see other people doing things, you watch, right? And like, if you don't take the chance and you watch other people taking the chances and doing well, now you're one step behind. And then you watch them continue to take chances. Now you're three steps behind. And you watch them just continue over the course of a year, you're watching someone blow up and do great. And you know that person well, like, man, that guy's doing it. And here I am still thinking about that idea I had, and I didn't do it. And it just it's an erosion of confidence just over and over and over again, that hesitancy. And so I do think that even if that bias to action and the ability of people to make those moves, as you said, you know, you watch them do it and they do it over and over and over again, they know they can figure it out because the first leap, just taking that leap is like a shot in the arm. Then it makes you feel a little bit more confident because you made that leap. Nothing went wrong. And now you can figure out, can you do the next one? Can you figure out the next step? It like confidence stacks as you begin to continue to take risks. But I also think that hesitancy pulls you into this kind of negative loop where, you know, it builds on itself too. And you really have to be cautious that things don't kind of set on the on the table. And you just kind of look at them as you come in and out, because that will keep happening and you'll keep looking at it and it will keep bothering you. And then eventually you just feel like you'll make up some rationalization why it didn't happen. Like, you know, I'm so glad I didn't do that because I didn't really have the time or I got to spend a lot of extra time doing this or whatever it is. But you'll find a reason to rationalize it. And eventually it will go to the place where dreams die and there will be a lot of other things that will set in that bucket with it. And it will be unfortunate for you because you never got to see what would happen. ([Time 0:44:08](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ce0c2193-fd41-4418-96a6-be9521db29df))
    - **Note:** You need to have the confidence to take the first step and often there is a self esteem aspect that you don’t believe you can do it so you don’t take the leap and it compounds negatively. Confidence stacks as you take risks and so does negativity. Then you’ll rationalize it and it’ll go to where dreams die. Confidence is how we talk to ourselves and how we think about ourselves. How we conceptualize ourselves and who we see ourselves being. Confidence to go all in do something ridiculous and audacious at the edge and push against the imaginary rules to believe in themselves. Hesitancy and self esteem to not take the step then confidence erodes bias to action then figure it out stack confidence not hesitancy. People will try to knock you down and make you small but they’ve never done anything don’t listen to them keep trying and you’ll figure it out. Some people will be envious of others doing big things others will see it as fuel. We can discredit things we don’t like easily and tear others down that we failed in and we justify why they did it and we didn’t. We focus on doing things that reinforces our self concept instead of the truth. Take low stakes risks and then build up these mini risks and challenges to create the risk taking muscle. Don’t build in public build in private and arrive like a thunderbolt. Make it you vs you. Build a positive feedback loop of swagger. Don’t talk about what you want to do but build in silence and create an execution plan. Fox progress board. Make it you vs you.
