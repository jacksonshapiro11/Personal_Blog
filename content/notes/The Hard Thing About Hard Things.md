- Don’t be a prosecuting attorney and cry over spilled milk live in the moment forget sunk costs do t point fingers and then put in better processes for the future. You need to balance accountability with creativity. Accountability is important but you need to weight who’s doing the task senior people vs junior degree of difficulty on the project marketing deliverable vs intense engineering and then risk and return they took of they took intelligent risk that’s great but stupid risk like drunk driving is stupid. This is how you balance creativity and accountable with this 3x3 matrix. Be yourself focus on your unique differentiation to be successful

    - **Note:** Don't point fingers and cry about the past. Balance accountability and creativity. When doing a project think is this senior vs jr people marketing vs tech and risk vs return this is how you create the right level of accountability
- Story and strategy should be the same thing clarity of purpose and execution proper output of the strategy is the story. Knowing what to do is sir to the speed and clarity of the ceos decisions. The story is the core why of the company why do you exist can be pages long but has to be clear why you matter and are different deserve to exist what do you stand for. CEO is required to make decisions under u certainty that’s the job so you must gather all information possible so you give yourself the best chance but you must do this it’s the whole job. Leadership also a core tenant making sure the company and team is right and going in the right direction. Organizational design is key for an organization without this you fail good measure is how much time people do their jobs vs fighting process beauracracy and politics. CEOs must set the right metrics to hit for their company that matches their size type and opportunity not too big or small a software company different from hardware yelp different from Twitter but these are important because they guide the company

    - **Note:** Story you tell yourself about the company and the strategy should be aligned. Making decisions under uncertainty is the job that gives you the best chance to be successful. Organizational design is vital you need to design and shape the organization to meet your goals and capabilities basically match skills and abilities optimize for the right metrics have a strong right ot exist.
- 1s are people who set the vision and think about company philosophy 2s implement and are opperational based you need to be both but usually skew 1 way. Good ceos have the ability to articulate the vision the right kind of ambition and the ability to achieve the vision. One is the Steve Jobs getting people to stick by him the other is like bill Campbell getting people to follow you because they see how much you care so they care as well. Then the Andy grove operational excellence to execute. Vision support of workers and operations ability. Peacetime ceo builds a good culture and process but a wartime ceo is always paranoid doing things by the book full focus on the mission be growing the pie. Wartime ceos vs peacetime one is a constant fight the other is the growth they right management books about. Everyone learns how to be a ceo it’s not born. Giving feedback is vital but being a ceo is learned and you need to do things in your own way and genuinely. Give feedback don’t prepare people to get fired prepare them for success. Be honest and genuinely care don’t bs people Feedback is a dialogue not a monologue don’t beat people up in front of others and adjust feedback to them if they’re overly sensitive of thick skinned ect. More feedback creates culture of honesty and places less stress on periodic catch ups and more open dialogue that surfaces truth creating a high trust culture.

    - **Note:** Create a culture of high trust and honest feedback rooted in support not in front of others to show people up but in private and direct. 2 way not 1 way conversation. You have some leaders who are mission/ vision oriented and others who are process and execution people you need to balance both. Leadership is a learning process. War vs peacetime leader
- The most important ceo skill is managing your psychology all other skills you can learn more or less but this one is the most difficult and personal. High sense of purpose and ability to galvanize others you must learn on the job. The best a ceo can do is 22/100. The failure is all yours as the founder ceo you make all the decisions hire all the people you face impossible do or die decisions constantly and you must do so alone you need to balance not over or under reacting make sure yiu attack the right problems in the right order with vigor the most important ones. Companies typically have 2-5 were fucked if we don’t moments. To avoid this write you’re thinking down make friends with similar experiences and focus on the road not the wall what can you right and your path not the obstacles. The best ceos brave the pain and don’t quit. You need to have the courage to listen to others but in the end do what you think is best you’re in charge the buck stops with you take ownership. You’ll never not feel terrible about going against the crowed for a big decision but you can develop courage over time by standing in the face of tough decisions constantly you feel scared but you learn to ignore them. Do what’s lonely and right vs popular or wrong.

    - **Note:** The most important thing is managing your psychology. No one is perfect but you have all the agency. You must listen and own your decisions and be brave/ courageous. Every company and life has existential pivotal moments where you embrace or turn away from an opportunity and this shapes your future. Meet people with similar experiences dominate your mind write down your thoughts. Make the tough decisions and trust yourself.
- Culture is different than perks move fast and break things is culture dogs at work is a perk. You need to create a good culture but a great culture doesn’t matter with a shit product. Culture should be unique to you. Org designis important you must not scale but give up ground gracefully into scale not over scale to quick but when it hurts. Scale requires you to design good processes with clear objectives and success metrics that can be repeated across the org. Dont judge your team for the role in 12 months but now then reasses people can grow. Progress changes needs but you must survive today and people grow. Pre judge is death but judge once a quarter.
    - **Tags:** #growth-mindset, #scale, #hire-when-it-hurts, #culture-(strong/intentional), #growth-and-death, #first-dont-lose-then-win
    - **Note:** Culture vs perks. Good intentional culture. Scale and hire when it hurts. Don't hire people for who they need to be hire what you need now and let them grow
- Hire team not me focused people the right ambition. It’s important to not over promote someone and do this across the org so one area dies t have a top heavy org. You do this by making a promotee prove they are better than existing workers at the higher level on key dimensions once the quality falls for one person it collapses. Highly disciplined promotion process. You can either give great titles that mean nothing ie over title or under title to make people earn it they both have trade offs one attracts people and one filters. Smart people are the ones apt to cause the most trouble because you give them more hope you can only give infinite rope to a few people like Dennis Rodman the rest you can’t you need to limit. Hiring senior people is vital for progress but given you don’t know how to do those things it’s important to set high absolute standards instead of relative uninformed ones given you have no background or experience. One on ones are for junior employees to talk about their personal life random side projects anything that’s not in a progress report managers should do 10% of the talking and the questions they should ask should guide the org around who’s a start performer key initiatives what’s working and isn’t ect.

    - **Note:** Find people with the right kind of ambition don’t over promote or give crazy titles. One on ones are for younger people so senior people can understand what’s going on in their lives. Hiring promotion and star players do you need to be very careful about who you give infinite rope to and how you hire and promote.
- Don’t give bad tasks and incentives that lead to undesired outcomes. He wanted to smooth revenue through the quarter but this just led to less overall revenue that was more smooth better to have more intermittent. You can’t focus and optimize for metrics you need to understand qualitative metrics are we optimizing for acquiring or retaining customers. Were investing for the future comes at a risk now of lower revenue we need to balance the 2. You can’t accrue management debt which means not creating co heads not overpaying people and creating normal review schedules if you don’t do this you are creating management debt you’ll need to take care of anyways so don’t accrue it. Don’t opt for the easy decision but the hard and right one wiry the least management debt. Create a strong hr interviewing and management process do you pay them well are they engaged do they quit often and why. Create incentives to avoid politics that means people don’t get raises by asking for it but because they deserve it people can’t get paid because they get a bid away or threaten to quit but deserve it once you cave once you set a standard which you can’t do. Hire people with the right ambition that puts the company success above theirs and build processes that insulates from political areas like performance management and compensation. Evaluate comp together and have a clear organizational chart. Make things less corruptable. Be careful what you say avoid ad hoc

    - **Note:** Don’t do the smooth and easy thing because it looks nice optimize for the outcome don’t create management debt. Create the right incentives. Have the right kind of ambition. Long and short term incentive misalignment do the thing that’s best long term even if it’s hard now.
- When you’re a start up executive you need 8-10 initiatives per day no one comes to you you must do things yourself. Most of this start up is creating the unknown and willing the world to bend to you. It’s not complex it’s just work. Don’t hide executives who want to learn from big companies hire executives who will come in and do things without that outreach there is no company. You can’t be lazy in outreach you need to physically push everything forward yourself. Don’t worry about equity going from a big to small company is about creative agency. You need to set the pace personally and have more initiatives then actual time. Force people to learn the market and get in the mix learn more about the industry every day by being in the field. If you don’t know what you want chances you’ll get it are low. When you’re hiring and in life you need to know what you want then let that guide your search. Admit your ignorance and hire good people not from central casting who look right. Understand the role well even take a shot at functioning in the role. You need the right fit not the best person everyone has flaws don’t hire because someone has the fewest flaws but the best trade offs.

    - **Note:** Start ups are about execution and bending the world not just thinking. You cannot be lazy you need to get action. Do outreach. Going small is about creative agency. Go fast set the pace. Learn the market/ understand the problem. Know what you want you cannot be clueless then let that guide you. Admit ignorance and hire the right fit not the best on paper everyone has flaws and trade offs. Learn the industry.
- People product profits in this order. Build a good company this is important make your company a great place to work because if it isn’t when shit hits the fan people leave. You need to make the company an end in itself. He hired mark crannie to be head of sales he literally wrote a manual on sales but was a bad cultural fit so everyone fought the hire he was a general Patton of sales but he was amazing at it and had he not been rough around the edges he wouldn’t even be a candidate hire for skills then work on the culture. Training your people is more important than hiring. Andy grove high output management get the training clear and continue to grow your people or they’ll stagnate. Good product manager bad product manager you need to get on the same page with people and focus on what’s important in training. Allow people in the org to teach others. Good product managers are the ceo of the product and take ownership make it work under all circumstances bad product managers have good excuses good product managers create the what not the how and maintain good communication focus on revenue and customers get ahead of questions anticipate flaws. Take positions on key issues and solve them bad product managers put out fires all day. Dont focus on competition decompose questions and tell the story assume customers are smart and ask your questions to them don’t answer theirs good product managers air on the side of success and are disciplined

    - **Note:** Company starts with the people which means hiring the right ones and making them feel empowered to make important decisions and control their lives. Training must be clear and you must have everyone understand the minutia the what not the how. Good product manager is an owner who communicates well and anticipates. Listens and respects customers
- When firing an executive you need to tell the board tell the executive make it clear that’s the decision and the firm failed they weren’t the right fit. Hire growth executives quickly. When you fire your friends or demote them increase comp be clear the org has outgrown their spot but they’re still valued. We ignore bad news and explain it away but view and act on good news. Sometimes your searching for sliver bullets but you need lead bullets you just need a better product you don’t need better features that fix everything no one cars that your product isn’t working and wants to hear excuses just make it work. Just win baby al Davis.
    - **Tags:** #firing, #silver-bullets
    - **Note:** Making firing decisions quickly. Sometimes you just need lead bullets just get action and get things done.
- Layoffs can easily destroy culture so how can you lay people off the right way. When you have layoffs do it don’t delay. It’s hard to focus on the future but you must. Be clear in your own mind about why you’re laying people off you’re laying people off because the company and you are failing not because individual performance issues. The company failed and we needed to let go of good people. Managers must lay off their own people explain why they failed and take ownership these people worked hard for you and you need to look them in the eyes no bull shit managers must have the script and the ceo must let everyone know before the layoff what’s happening you need to be there for your people in failure. When you have to fire an executive it’s because you failed to define the position right of focused on their flaws instead of what makes them great. Firing for misbehavior is rarely a thing or issue but the most importanr part of firing is trying to figure out how you hired the wrong person in the first place. Dont hire mediocre people and don’t hire for scale too soon. Hire not the most qualified from central casting or the person for the next stage but the person who helps the next 2 years. Who is the right person not a box checker.
- Being a CEO isn’t about playing the odds but making magic happen against the odds. You need to keep death in mind at all times. Everyone starts with wide eyes and hope but over time the struggle appears and grows and it becomes a dog fight you need to pivot products and you’re gonna die can can’t raise money. The struggle is the entire building process and never stops. There’s always another pivot or move event public with 2mm in revenue promising 75 in one year to make you need to create it if it isn’t clear. Share the burden be honest with employees don’t lie. It’s your fault but don’t take it personally it doesn’t help. First don’t lose tech is fast evolving stay alive long enough to get lucky everyone makes mistakes beating yourself up over them helps no one. You need to communicate more more communication creates a more open culture that attacks problems better. You don’t have enough rope not to have information flow freely you need to get problems out there and also good news control the narrative because only the employees can fix it they care less than you because it’s not a job to you and negative info gets out there so you need to control the narrative. Trust is built by telling things as they are and is vital to success. This leads to more brains working on the biggest problems circulate bad news fast and investigate it health culture encouraged bad news. Information flow is vital and key to success keep it flowing don’t be overwhelming positive tell it like it is.
- They had to go all hands on deck working 8-10 7 days a week and this invigorated the team it didn’t discourage it. Grow through hardship the market is rarely efficient he was going to buy or build a network architecture he bought the cheapest one had the best product and ended up landing a contract for 90% of the purchase price soon after acquisition. He sold a business for 1.65bn they had offers on the table demanded $14 per share everyone walked away then people came back a month later and they got something done he didn’t want to sell but the team couldn’t take another massive pivot. Had to sell but he was sick and cried.

    - **Note:** All hands on deck people want to work hard and go on the right direction and grow through hardship selling his company was very hard, but he had to do it. Unique problem-solving and the market is rarely efficient.
- He knew he’d probably have to shut down the company fire everyone and lose all the money of his mother even. He saw this in the competition first realizing their business didn’t work and they had the same exactly business. He switched from a peace to wartime ceo but he stayed relentless. When thinking of the company folding he figured out what he would salvage if he could in bankruptcy this led him to pivot from cloud to saas but 95% of the company was in cloud so he needed to do it well and quietly or it would sink the company. They were racing against time and they needed to set artificial deadlines because they were gonna die if they couldn’t see quick enough simulate interest and speed instead of going to the closing dinner for the sale he needed to stay back and let the workers know where their future was. They were almost delisted he needed to rally the troops offered to help people get jobs if they wanted to leave but described the vision and how he saw the future of the 78 employees that stayed they all stayed through the sale 5 years later. They 14x stock price they were out of the woods then Their biggest customer wanted to fire them. Frank at eds the company that was firing them said they were out they begged for 60 days they supercharged product development integrated the solution better found a leverage point that led to an acquisition that saved the company. No vendor had ever done as much to save the relationship. Know who you’re working with and go the extra mile

    - **Note:** He needed to become a wartime ceo and cut 95% of the company but do it in silence. Crazy tactics just to survive they artificial deadlines. Almost delisted they understood their customers deeply super charged growth and went to the moon. Contemplate death then avoid it
- The internet wasn’t inevitable for awhile and people expected a closed web if that. Part of being a man is when you start to put the needs of others in front of your needs. Marc andreesen knew the entire computer industry at 22 and had a great product mind. Netscape created the open web. Ben saw his life in his mid 20s with kids saw this couldn’t be his life and interviewed at Netscape as a result. Start ups are euphoria and terror when he was raising you only need 1 investors but he blew money fast. They went from hottest start up to unfundablr in 6 months. Bill campbell was a guy who you could always go to in a pinch to fight and support you and your darkest moments and be genuinely happy for you when great things happened. The company needed to go public and do it as a down round and reverse split the stock so the valuation would even be high enough to go public. The roadshow was brutal and depressing. This was a very dark time for Ben his wife almost died and he didn’t even go home he was too focused on the ipo to save the company. If you’re gonna eat shit do it all at once don’t nibble they realized they were gonna miss guidance and instead of lowering it piecemeal they took it down all in once ate the shit.

    - **Note:** The future is unsure even in the middle of the Internet Bloom. It was unclear what the web would look like if you’re going to eat shit eat it all at once the motivation of this can’t be my life is powerful. You only need one investor. Having people like Harry Nyquist to support you and sometimes the leader you have to make horrible difficult decisions but that pain must be taken and it must be taken immediately
      Have the right people to bounce ideas off and this can’t be my life.
