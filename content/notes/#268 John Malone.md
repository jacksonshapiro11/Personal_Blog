  Speaker 1
  That was an excerpt from a lawsuit that malone's one time rival, summer redstone, filed. And i is found in the book im goin talking about to day, which is cable cowboy. John malone in the rise of the modern cable business and i, as written by mark robeshaw. So before i go to the actual book, i want to read some high lights from this fantastic twitter thread written by this anonymous account called low line finance. It was written a few years ago, and i think it gives a fantastic over view of john malone's philosophy on company building. And i think knowing this before we go into some of the high lights, it actally enhants your understanding of the high lights as we go through. So the first idea malone believed in building long term value through leveraged cash flow. Earnings didn't count. He was not constrained by quarterly expectations the entire time that he runs t c i. It's a public company. And so he would tell his stockholders, if you're going to ask about quarterly earnings, you're at the wrong meeting and you probably own the wrong stock. I'll go into a lot more detail about his philosophy once we get to the book. Malone built the pipes, then bought the water that flows through them. So he wanted to own the cable lines gong directly into the house andthe parts of the programming that flowed through those lines. This is why, by becoming a gatekeeper with access to subscribers, he could negotiate equity stakes in the channels, gaining huge financial upside. Third idea, malone took spartan operations to another level. Absolutely no bureaucracy, no waste. ([Time 0:07:53](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e5da25c3-f61a-4b56-9f77-cc425d5634ec))
    - **Note:** Malone was always focused on cash flow over the long term not quarterly earnings. He first bought all the cable providers then negotiated equity in the channels. He had no central beauracracy everything was light and decentralized no big staff no organizational complexity where one subsidiary could have an issue that would sink the company. He did an m&a deal every 2 weeks for 15 years and tci had a 550x over his tenure. He gave managers economics so they were incentivized. The cable industry started as a bunch of cowboys putting up ateneas to get service. Malone was a robber baron crushing competition and helping his aligned companies. He would do complex deals and move quietly. He was a complex person given his robber baron nature where he achieved greatness but broke or bended almost every rule drawing the eyre of competition. His moral goal was to build wealth for shareholders and he screwed customers to do this. He turns down 150k limo ect to work at Warner the dominant player to take a job at tci for 60k a year he was told he had a great future at tci if he could create it. He needed to shape his world he was very smart and this happened at 29. He was going long agency and long term control off the beaten path. He moved from the east coast of mba to the west coast of wild drinking rough riders.

  Speaker 1
  So 20 years earlier than we were in the story, when he gave two strangers a ride after meeting them in a cotton gin. Bob was then a 28 year old cottonseed buyer at the time. And then it gives us background on his life to some high lights. He had grown up during the great depression, and he came from a family of farmers and ranchers. After serving a war war two, he pursued a college degree. And he was looking for the prosperity that the post war american economy could offer. He also worked in oil fields during the summers. That's when he meets his wife. And it says he would gain more than a country girl. She would also prove to be an astute business partner. And a trait that bob had early in his life that he kept his entire life, was he kept his mouth shut. He hated that malone would tell competitors like their strategies and stuff. Just as malone learned to listen instead of talk. And within a short time, he could read a customer like a poker player, anticipating what that person wanted from the deal moments into the negotiation. And when i got to that part, it made me think of one of my favorite lines from when i read michael jordan's autobiography on episode two 13. And i've never forgot the line since then. He says, successful people listen. Those who don't listen don't urvive long. And we're seing the same thing from young bob magnus here. And then this is how he found the opportunity. So he's given these two hitchakers a ride, and he says the two men told him that they had just built a big community antenna system. And what did this system do? It helped folks in tiny towns get broadcast tv signals from bigger markets far away. ([Time 0:21:10](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ebd59bae-7476-4c21-8ce7-5cb013c54120))
    - **Note:** Bob magnes founded tci built a lot of it by hand with a lot of leverage. He was always listening and heard about this new tv industry in the 50s built the first station by hand in Memphis in the 50s. The greats listen. When Malone joined the company was taking on debt to built more outlets and were running very fragile 130mm debt to 19mm revenue but they always managed to grow enough to meet payments. This seemed unorthodox but presented a massive opportunity. If you could extend the tv coverage outside of cities you could sell the programming for free it was a licsence to steal. Bob sold his ranch and borrowed 2500 from his grandpa on something cable he had never used. Bet the farm made generational wealth. Excellence is the capacity to take pain Bob had so much debt at 200 different networks in 21 states he was drinking constantly and decided he needed help so he hired Malone. Malones first year is the worst in the company’s history he moved his wife halfway across the country turns down lucrative deals only to watch his stock options fall in half. The cable industry was high gross margin and cash flow and depreciation costs were high which shielded taxes. Great industry and John decided he would invest every dollar of earning back into the business to grow it. John was incredibly smart and hardworking but he wanted to impress his dad his entire life. The story of the father is embedded in the son. After year 1 he had to cut his salary and couldn’t afford phone service. He becomes very demanding of himself
- Gerald Malone: Expanding with Efficiency of Scale
  Key takeaways:
  - The idea of identifying opportunities in parallel industries is powerful.
  - Gerald Malone's career exemplifies the concept of recognizing potential in a related industry.
  - Scale and efficiency were integral to Malone's growth strategy.
  - Malone leveraged the concept of bulk purchasing to reduce costs and increase profits.
  - Malone's approach shares similarities with Rockefeller's ruthless efficiency and hyper competence.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And i think this is a very powerful idea to think about, iti the idea that you can actually identify an opportunity because you have deep knowledge about one industry, and then you see Another industry developing parallel to the industry that you know about. Malone's career is another example of that, because he goes for mackenzie, right? Is working at mackenzie for a cable equipment operator. Then the guys ik come run the cable equipment operator. But not only did they make cable equipment, but they also were the third largest cable operator at the time. Then through these meetings, selling and running this cable equipment maker. He's going to meet. One of his customers is bob magnus. So says, in the process of studying gerald, malone saw for the first time the potential of cable tv. Gerald was a, was a cable equipment maker that happened to be the third largest cable operator in america, and they're growing fast. And so what's hapening is he seeing the difference that scale he uses very, you think of malone very much, to me, he's very similar to, like, another rockefeller. And just like rockefeller, was intent on getting as big as possible, as fast as possible. So malone, and this is part of the reason, slowly, efficiencies of scale stretched out before him. The bigger you are, the more parts you order. Remember, he's focused just on the cable equipment making at this point, ok? The more parts you order, the cheaper the parts. Before malone arrived at gerald, the company was paying eight cents for each of these tiny connectors they needed in this equipment, right? Malone, as they start to go started buying them for one tenth of one cent. Remember this part for later. He literally uses the same idea when he's buying programming from people like c n n and hbo. When we were small, we paid eight cents. Now we're big, we pay one tenth of one cent. I'm going to read something i said forty seven minutes into te episode two. 54. This. If you have't listend epissod to 54, you got to go back and listen to it, cause it can give you ad vantage. How many people have read a forty year old, obscure biography on rockefeller? Right? Nd, so i got to somewhere in the book, and iik, you really can break down what rockefeller was trying to do, and this is very similar to what malone's doing. So im going to read from forty seven minutes into episode two. 54, ok. And so this is what i said trig, to summarize what rockefeller's doing. Step one, you raise money so you can increase production. Step two, use your increased production to get better rates on transportation than other refiners. Step three, use your increased profits, because you have better transportation rates, to buy your competitors. Step four, continue to find secret sources of income. In a described rockefeller's approach at building his company and absolutely destroying his competitors as ruthless efficiency and hyper competence. ([Time 0:33:34](https://share.snipd.com/snip/54ac0234-fcf6-4d7c-9f0b-b24e4c115cfb))
    - **Note:** Malone works at McKinsey and stumbles into cable on a consulting project for Gerald a tv manufacturing provider he moves over and realizes how valuable scale is in cable and this becomes his playbook when he’s growing tci and negotiating deals with the channels he uses his scale to get better pricing. Rockefeller invested in scale economies used that to starve competition bought them gained greater scale economies as a flywheel. Ruthless efficiency and hyper competence. There was a division that spent lavishly and didn’t think like owners Malone was incredibly frugal and wanted to kill this guy. Big spenders find ways to spend more and frugal people find further ways to cut costs even well below the competition. Mindset focus. Tci was so in debt they had to keep dodging the mortgages he spent the first couple years staying alive and avoiding the banks. He feared failure more than success and that’s what drove him forward in these tough times. He came up with the tax shielded cash flow strategy to create long term value he thought long and hard and this was extremely counter positioned to convention. It took years for him to find the right shareholders but once he did he never needed debt again. He stayed in the game long enough to get lucky.
- He told one group of t c i investors, what we care about is value
  Key takeaways:
  - Value creation for shareholders is a priority for t c i investors
  - Finding the right shareholders allowed t c i to avoid borrowing from banks
  - Institutional investors drove up the company's stock price
  - t c i was able to raise capital in the equity markets
  - John Malone's success came after staying in the game long enough to get lucky
  - Malone's decision to profit from both owning the cable and its content was controversial
  - Malone believed in owning both the pipe and the water flowing through it
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  He told one group of t c i investors, what we care about is value. We want to create value for our shareholders. So it takes him a while to find the right shareholders for his business, but once it does, it changes forever, ecause then he doesn' have to borrow from banks any more. A years later, institutional investors discovered the company's stock and started to take the price up. T c i was finally able to go to the equity markets to raise capital. From that point forward, malone never looked back. This is 19 78, so he's six years into the job. And then something that i think about all the time, and i think its very obvious if you read a bunch of these biographies with me, i wrote down on this page, stay in the game long enough to Get lucky. Nw, i want to move ahead to one of his main ideas. This actioly becomes really controversial. And a lot of this is where he becomes accused of, rightly most likely, ah, to be a monopolist. So this is where he decides, tha, we're not just goig to makeo money on the piping and owning the wires. We're going to make money on the content too. In part of this is what i mentioned earliertat. I really do believe that malone thought about his industry much more than anybody else in he inside the industry. Rather than just owning the cable that delivered the new programming, t c i needed to own a piece of the cable channels themselves thereby sharing in a whole extra upside. Malone thought that t c i could own both the pipe and the water flowing through it. ([Time 0:43:09](https://share.snipd.com/snip/db34a901-05b0-4d82-98c8-3f44c672e769))
    - **Note:** He became a monopolist owning the cable and the channels. This gets him into hot water. Tci had 2mm households and could promise of restrict distribution and they were king makers restricting or allowing companies that did deals for them. He also understood the market and would pass on overpaying for things when the market was hot instead opting to buy them at discounts when the market turned. Great capital allocator. He could grow in downturn taking advantage of bargains. Malone understood the industry maybe more than anyone. They were very frugal and lean no hr shared secretary’s no Madison ave office they were cable cowboys. Accumulation of assets over time not making money in the short term. People wanted to run through walls for Malone. His staff worked for him for 15 years. The company had 6 fully dicentralozsd and independent operating segments. He controlled the distribution almost 20% of America. He paid $.90 for hbo bit smaller operators paid $5 for hbo.
- John Malone's Philosophy and the Cable Industry Monopoly
  Key takeaways:
  - Henry Ford's philosophy of prioritizing customer satisfaction is beneficial for consumers
  - John Malone's belief that building wealth is a moral achievement can lead to poor customer service
  - Charging as much as possible and minimizing expenses at the expense of customers is not a favorable approach
  - The cable industry has had a history of customer abuse due to its monopoly status
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And malone didn't, again, go back to why i said that earlier, i spent so much time talking bout hay, really think about why he believes the way what he believes, that he thinks like the Building of wealth is a moral achievement. The problem is alot some of that wealth came at the expense of his customers, instead of in service of his customers. So says to malone, the outcry over lousy customer relations and price increases was merely a by product of good business. Charge as much as you can for a product or service and spend as little as you can get away with in providing it. Now, that's not a direct quote, tha's the author's description of his philosophy, but that's terrible. The reason i think henry ford had a right, because what i mentioned on the couple episodes ago, when i reread his autobiography, is because you want the like, we're only building one Company, right? But we're patrons or customers of thousands over our life. And clearly it would be beneficial for us if the companies that we're giving our money to actually had henry ford's philosophy, and not john malone' idea was like olh, the outcry over Logy, customer relations and price increases was merely a by product of good business. Charge as much as you can for a product or service and spend as little as you can get away with in providing it. That's how you know that he owned a monopoly. And this idea was actually picked up becausei i had stopped paying for cable over ten years ago. And i think cord cutters were usually younger people because the'r like o, i cad just use the internet. Why would i pay for cable? And it's this abuse of the customer tha that carried on for decade after decade in the cable industry because they had a essentially government regulated monopoly. ([Time 0:52:21](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ccaab2fe-c50e-4573-acf9-519d2b98beb6))
    - **Note:** He exploited customers for the shareholders. He could do this in a monopoly. Figure our what you want your life to be then Do that. He was also not getting rich because he had such little equity so he split the content from
      The cable business ti avoid anti trust and that because he enjoyed content. He’s 60 and not happy but very successful so he restructured his life. Writes down his goals then the actions he needs to take to achieve that. A great life is a string of great days. He wants to leave have a control stake and run Liberty the content piece and move out of the stress of cable. He knew he was a deal make not an operator. He realizes he isn’t doing what he wants at all when be examines his life and decides to make changes. John decides to sell the company but the deal falls through then Bob who he saw as a father figure dies. He falls into a deep depression. He then sells eventually to AT and T and realized that AT and T was run by managers not owners. Managers want more control owners want better economics. Work in an industry where the founders are still around.
