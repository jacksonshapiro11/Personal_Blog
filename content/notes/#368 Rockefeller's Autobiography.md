### Highlights

- Wealth is Measured in Memories
  Summary:
  Secrecy played a vital role in Rockefeller's business strategy, as highlighted in a reflective book that emphasizes the importance of relationships over material wealth.
  The first chapter focuses on the significant figures in Rockefeller's life, illustrating that as he reflects on his experiences, he values the adventures shared with friends and mentors more than his financial success. This perspective resonates with lessons learned from a personal mentor, who, even on his deathbed, cherished memories over riches, reinforcing the idea that meaningful connections and shared experiences are paramount.

  So if you haven't had a chance, make sure you go back and listen to episode 254 and try to find that book if you can. It goes into great detail about how secrecy was so important to the way that Rockefeller built his business. So the first chapter of this book, he dedicates to friends, and he immediately tells us why. Looking back over my life the impressions Which come most vividly to my mind are mental pictures of my old associates This is also something that recurs over and over again I don't know If I mentioned on the last episode of sam's oh But my friend that was mentored and essentially best friends with sam For you know decades was with him on his deathbed and one of the most Important lessons that I learned from that is Sam wasn't talking about, you know, look at all the billions of dollars I have in my bank account. He was reminiscing and talking about all the great times they had together and the adventures and the fun. And so when Rockefeller is writing these words, he's the richest person, arguably the richest person on the planet. And the entire first chapter is just about all the characters and most of these become business partners. So the first person he talks about, this guy makes me laugh so much. He says, I shall never forget my first meeting with Mr. John D. ([Time 0:05:47](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e9d3497f-205e-4905-b94f-dc60faf0eef6))
    - **Note:** Bad boys, move in silence and life is defined by relationships. Hired talent has found not as needed so he had a team of a player founders. Success is a critical mass of smart people. Argues debates with all of his team constantly. Take conflict over agreement. Be careful when a person is arguing a position and becomes entrenched in it Conviction is putting money where your mouth is incentive allignment. He had someone who was against the project and then Rockefeller said he put up the money himself, and the guy said he would go in with him. Had problems constantly do everything and you will win the oil is boom bus, but he was always successful through cycles. Always default, aggressive. Constant source for mild improvement and always made of decision unanimous in the end. Do the best you can with the opportunity in front of you opportunity handled well leads to more opportunity. Flagler was a good produce person which got him recognized and into standard oil where he became very rich, but has he not worked hard at that. He would’ve never been successful and gotten more opportunities. Flagler was the perfect partner
- Building Opportunity on Solid Foundations
  Summary:
  Handling opportunity with excellence fosters more opportunity.
  The journey of Flagler and Rockefeller in the developing oil industry exemplifies the importance of foresight and quality. They made a conscious decision to treat their new venture as a long-term enterprise, contrary to the prevailing belief that the industry was temporary.
  This mindset prompted them to build their business as if it would endure for decades.
  Flagler emphasized the necessity of constructing robust refineries that set a standard contrary to the flimsy options typical of the time.
  Their commitment to quality and strong values established a foundation for future success, highlighting the value of strategic partnerships and the impact of vision on long-term business sustainability.

  So that's a point. Opportunity handled well leads to more opportunity. If Flagler wasn't doing the very best job he could of handling produce, he would have never had the opportunity to become a partner in what's going to be the most valuable, maybe the most Valuable business ever created. So he says, when the oil business was developing, we need more help. I at once thought of Mr. Flagler as a possible partner and made him an offer to come with us and give up his commission business. This offer he accepted. It was a friendship founded on business, which Mr. Flagler used to say was a good deal better than a business founded on friendship. And my experience leads me to agree with him. And so at the very beginning of their careers, they are inseparable. And so Rockefeller talks about this. We work shoulder to shoulder. Our desks were in the same room. We both lived on Euclid Avenue, a few houses apart. We met and walked to the office together. We'd walk home from lunch together and back again to the office after lunch and home again at night. On these walks, when we were away from the office interruptions, we did our thinking, talk, beginning and planning together. And it's very clear that he picked the right partner because at the very beginning, it's really important to note at the very beginning of the oil industry, people thought it was temporary. They said, OK, we discovered oil in this one area in Pennsylvania. It's going to soon run out and there's no oil anywhere else. And yet Flagler and Rockefeller's perspective, really what they're about to tell us, the way I would summarize this is, you know, act from the very beginning as if the business will Be around in 50 years. And if you have that thought, what would you do? I think this is a variation of David Ogilvie's maxim that you should build a first-class business in a first-class way. And that was Flagler's perspective from the very beginning. He says, Another thing about Mr. Flagler, for which I think he deserves a great credit, was that in the early days he insisted that when a refinery was to be put up, it should be different from the flimsy shacks which it Was then custom to build. He always believed that if we went into the oil business at all, we should do the work as well as we knew how, that we should have the very best facilities, that everything should be solid And substantial, and that nothing should be left undone to produce the finest results. He followed his convictions of building as though the trade was going to last, and as a result, he laid strong foundations for later years. So remember, we're still in the first chapter, and this is the richest person on the planet at the time telling, he's giving advice to younger people about the importance of friendship. He says, these old men's tales will be valuable to the next generation, and they will not be useless, he says. ([Time 0:15:51](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a48261b6-8f79-46b8-b499-a24ade39e41a))
    - **Note:** Flagler in Rockfeller were the perfect partners and most people thought oil was fleeting, but they took the long view which is why they were able to become successful. They built for 50 years and build strong foundations which created their success. Froendship is vital. You don’t want turnover in your court team. Do you want those to compound for decades you can’t replace that. He had a deep knowledge of his business and hated amateurs. He knows the business better than anyone. Go to sleep on a win wake up with a loss remain vigilant. He lives with a chip on his shoulder when someone tells him he can’t he doubles down. Absolute dog. His life starts with doubt. All great things from compounding. Don’t look too far in the future focus what’s at hand. All business is run on beliefs have a strong set of beliefs and you will be ok. They believes so they bought stock from everyone. In 1909 everyone believed there were no opportunities there is always a new frontier.
- Clarity in Numbers Leads to Success
  Summary:
  Successful business management requires an intimate understanding of financial realities.
  Competitors who neglect accurate record-keeping and fail to track profits and losses engage in unintelligent competition, risking their business's viability. To achieve lasting success, one must honestly assess their financial situation, closely monitor expenses, and be transparent about their dealings.
  This foundational principle of clarity and honesty in business is essential for making informed decisions and ensuring sustained growth.

  Speaker 1
  And so now Rockefeller starts to explain again the difference between the way he ran his business and the way his weak competitors did. Remember, go back to how full of disgust he was about the casual way in which they conducted their affairs. He's like, you will not have business success if you do this. He says, we had the type of man who really never knew all the facts about his own affairs. Many kept their books in such a way that they did not actually know when they were making money or when they were losing money. Listen to what he calls them. This unintelligent competition. From the very first, the men who managed the Standard Oil Company kept their books intelligently as well as correctly. We knew how much we made and where we gained or lost. My ideas of business, the fundamental principles of business do not change. You cannot change the underlying laws of trade. And he talks about the fact that if you don't know your numbers, if you're not watching all your expenses, if you don't know if you're making or losing money, you are not being honest with Yourself. And if you're not honest with yourself, you're not going to have business success. I have spoken of the necessity of being frank and honest with oneself about one's own affairs. ([Time 0:33:07](https://share.snipd.com/snip/88dd47a0-ff84-4700-9b55-23427954b484))
    - **Note:** You need to be honest with yourself. You can’t break the laws of business watch your cost understand it deeply. Know your facts and build on it. Gradually learning step by step. There’s success came from scale economy shared they made more and always passed discounts. His partners underestimated him and he lined up financing and bought the company from under them. Deep focus perfect it everything compounds todays benefits from 30 years ago. He was at the edge of technology which was oil. Narrow your focus. People like to boil oceans stay focused. Increase the intensity. Leadership is essential to business like a new coach comes in and takes a team from bad to great. Optimized transportation, he was told there was a certain rate, and then he built his own rate which led to a ton of growth. Rules are suggestions always ask the question. They leveraged their position to their advantage constantly. Follow the conic laws of trade. Most people doing great things are doing them for the first time find great people. Focus on service. Play long term games never short term. Never deceive yourself about what the game requires. There is no success without belief in yourself that gets others to believe in you. You cannot take a short cut to success. Success comes from service.
- Pursue Success Through Service and Integrity
  Summary:
  Success in business fundamentally hinges on adhering to established trade laws and prioritizing service over mere profit.
  One must avoid short-term gains that lead to uninspired, small successes and instead be prepared for eventual setbacks by fully understanding capital requirements and maintaining financial reserves. Honest self-assessment is critical; deceptive optimism can lead to failure.
  True ambition requires a vision larger than just accumulating wealth; it revolves around providing value to society.
  Genuine business success springs from fair dealings that foster trust, resulting in lasting confidence from others.
  Continuous learning about one’s business is essential to navigate market realities effectively. Innovators who create new fields rather than duplicating existing efforts will contribute significantly to societal progress, as success lies in addressing unmet needs and advancing public interests.

  Number one is follow the laws of trade. And then two, the importance of focusing on service. So he's talking about the importance of following the laws of trade, which he also repeats over and over again. So he says, I'm impressed anew with the importance of a principle that I've often referred to. If I can make this point clear to the young man who has had the patience to follow this book so far, it'll be a satisfaction to me and I hope it may be a benefit to him. The underlying essential element of success in business affairs is to follow the established laws of high class dealing. Don't even think of temporary advantages. Do not waste your effort on a thing which ends in a petty triumph unless you are satisfied with a life of petty success. He's not holding back there. Don't waste your effort on a thing which ends in a petty triumph unless you're satisfied with a life of petty success. Be sure that before you go into an enterprise, you see your way clear to stay through to a successful end. Look ahead. It is surprising how many bright businessmen go into important undertakings with little or no study of the controlling conditions they risk their all upon. Study diligently your capital requirements. He's talking again about the importance of having this fortress of cash. Study diligently your capital requirements and fortify yourself fully to cover possible setbacks because you can absolutely count on meeting setbacks be sure that you are not deceiving Yourself at any time about your actual conditions remember he repeats these things over and over again go back to earlier in the book he says i have spoken of the necessity of being frank And honest with oneself about one's own affairs many people assume that they can get away from the truth by avoiding thinking about it, but the natural law is inevitable and the sooner It is recognized, the better. Fast forward back to where we were in this book just now. He repeats that exact same idea, but this time he says, be sure that you're not deceiving yourself at any time about your actual conditions. The man who starts out simply with the idea of getting rich won't succeed. You must have a larger ambition. There is no mystery in business success. The great industrial leaders have told again and again the plain and obvious fact that there can be no permanent success without fair dealing that leads to widespread confidence in The man himself. And that is the real capital we all prize and work for. The fact that there is widespread confidence in yourself by other people and the people you're dealing with. Do not lose your head over a little success. That's another thing he repeats. Do not lose your head over a little success or grow impatient or discouraged by a little failure. Standard oil has continued to make progress even though all these panic years, he's talking about all the financial panics that happened since he started the company, even through All these panic years, and we've had large reserves of cash on account of our very conservative methods of financing. And just in case you thought he was done, no, he's not. He repeats this again. Know your numbers. You need to know your business down to the ground. Here again would venture to utter a word of caution to businessmen. Let them study their own affairs frankly and face the truth. If their methods are extravagant, let them realize the facts and act accordingly. One cannot successfully go against natural tendencies, and it is folly to fail to recognize them. And then the last piece of advice I feel is a combination of two of my favorite maxims from the history of entrepreneurship. The first maxim comes from Henry Ford. Henry Ford says that money comes naturally as a result of service. And then Edwin Land says, don't do anything someone else can do. So Rockefeller says, if I were to give advice to the young man starting out, I should say to him, do not begin your business career with the idea of getting from the world by hook or crook All you can. In the choice of your profession, let your first thought be, where can I fit in that I may be the most effective in the work of the world? Where can I lend a hand in a way that most effectively advances the general interest? If you choose your vocation in that way, you have taken the first step on the highest road to a large success. Investigation will show that the great fortunes which have been made in this country have come to men who have performed great and far-reaching economic services. The man will be most successful who confers the greatest service on the world. That is why Henry Ford says that money comes naturally as a result of service. Commercial enterprises that are needed by the public will pay. Commercial enterprises that are not needed fail and ought to fail. This is when he gets into you shouldn't be doing things that other people can do. The one thing that you would be most careful to avoid in your investment of time and effort is the unnecessary duplication of existing industries. You should regard all money spent in increasing needless competition as wasted and worse. The man who puts up a second factory, when the factory in existence will supply the public demand adequately and cheaply, is wasting the national wealth and destroying the national Prosperity. The single greatest obstacle to progress lies in the willingness of so many men to invest their time and money in multiplying competitive industries instead of opening up new fields. It requires a better type of mind to seek out and to support and create the new than to follow the worn paths of accepted success. The penalty of such a selfish attempt is to go on living without contributing to the progress or happiness of mankind. And I think those are great words of advice to close on to dedicate your life to building something that contributes to the progress and happiness of mankind.
