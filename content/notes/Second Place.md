### Highlights

- L doesn’t see death but the unreality of life. He sees the non being of life and discovers its unreality. He becomes released from his identity so he can really see the unreality of the world. She knows she has been disliked her whole life and the few people she’s like have reciprocated except L. She realizes how much she loves Tony in the experience and has some rediscovery. Love from the right people. Nothing exists except what one creates for themselves more wrestling than dreams. Half of freedom is willingness to take it when offered. It’s our sacred duty and what we can do for each other. Having a kid leads to giving up freedom in some ways. What were things more actual then after it happens. See through the illusion of personal feeling wherever many of the feelings that rule her have now faded out. She’s becoming a clearer channel. The truth lies not in any claim to reality but where what is real is beyond our interpretation true art is seeking to capture the unreal. Don’t let feeling lodge in your heart. L ends the book apologizing for being a bad person being resigned to his death and lamenting how we never know we’re living in the good old days when we are. Lose the present moment.
- The Self is our true God we have no other. Art reveals deep truth like science. Can catastrophe free us. Can what we are be so broken down we barely survive it. New energy comes from L after his stroke from the destructive areas of his life. Her umchangingness will be her doom. L hates her and he’s going crazy trying to destroy her after she’s already destroyed him. They’re giving L to the state she hates giving him up but you can’t keep a snake as a pet. She had been so generous he reciprocated nothing. She sees Justine as a fully grown woman and she feels like her job of a mom is done. L is confronting his own mortality without resignation though he’s fighting. She would care for L if he even reciprocated a bit but he never did. Human capacity for receptivity is a birth right. Children teach their parents. Some moments lie outside of time and love forever. We must give as much as we take from our life. She wants to surrender to a god that never comes. She remains a devourer when she wants to become a creator. Stillness can be the perfect form of action. Watching an organism confirm it’s being. There’s always parts of life we must pay extra attention to but these are never clear ahead of time. Whenever know. We need to live these pivot moments as we wish. She regrets not truly experiencing these night painting days. When she experiences this she feels more lost than ever but L is actually giving her what she’s always wanted and she just can’t see. So many of our feelings are illusions.
- She is finally seen, but then she sees L and Brett painting her as a fat old woman and this destroys her and she runs from Tony but now wants to run back, but Tony is left maybe never to return. She felt like life denied her victory in her life. They live parallel lives together. To love someone is to be prepared to obey them whether it’s an adult or a child. Love that doesn’t do this where you obey each other fully giving in to someone else. She runs from Tony but then think she’s more of an adult after and wants him to come back to her. L is a vampire on Brett’s youth. We become artificial people through deliberate for forgetting of the moments that made us who we are. There are some things you have to be able to kill. Tony accepted reality and saw his place in it as something he was responsible for L rejected reality and was trying to free himself of responsibility. Tony kills a deer because it was a higher good to save his life. Treat every moment as something that you inhabit and invest in every moment as if you had to live your life that way. Treat each moment as a preeminent condition where we must stay forever. This would lead us to a better more thoughtful life. The happiness people don’t borrow against the present moment but invest in the moment. Brett lives that life that suits her. Not caring for others. She believes in the plot of life and the universe guiding her. Now she sees the dissolution of her identity which gives her release in her life. L seeks to destroy her but she destroys him
- Tony starts to court her with beautiful language he shows that side but keeps it secret to her. There’s a certain point when you no longer care that time goes forward or that the arrow of time is a central plan in life’s illusion and while you’re waiting for the future you’re being robbed of your presence. Language stops time because it’s eternal. In romantic stories avoidance is used as attraction. Natures show what they desire by disdaining to avoid it. Worship comes before knowledge and you lose objectivity when you call in love. Need to seperate the subject from yourself. Then you need to face reality that’s when the truth is revealed. Don’t hold disgust inside of you. She sees her life as a facade. People don’t allow you to change when those changes go against their interest. She changes her course. Per simple revelation of personal truth, leads to much suffering and cruelty. People want you to be different. People push back against you when you go against them. Better to be dispossessed, then to walk where hatred masquerades as love. Her husband tries to break her. He steals Justine and she takes her back. She just wants to be seen by L in the way she saw herself through his work in this dark time in her life. Living is painful but we’re given moments of golden health. We sometimes forget we live with others and this is our only mortal life. She needs to learn how to live within herself. The truth lies in yourself. When L finally sees her she can see herself. She puts on her wedding dress and remembers how different of a person her and Tony were when they wore that at first. How much we change in our lives. How happy she was to finally be seen. She needs permission still to be seen clearly and she’s willing to give up everything to get it. No longer caring about Tony despite him being a great husband for this horrible painter who wants to destroy her. We turn into what we run from.
- Some people write because they don’t know how to live in the moment and must construct it. Her daughter wants to be free but the mom Connor let her go but Tony wants her to give her her love and let Justine take her love and do what she wants with it. This woman is crazy she doesn’t know how to be a parent or love her daughter so she just inverts how she was raised. Tony wants a dog but she stops him because she’s worried it’ll take attention from her. In being and becoming an object can remain itself even in its absence the lack of a dog says more about the void it fills in its absence than presence. It stands for security the non dog represents the trusting and finding security in humans. An object remains itself in conflict. L cuts through reality. True love is the product of freedom. He loves Ls cruelty because it shows him the truth. Kurt tells the narrator that L told him he needed an edge because he felt he was losing Justine and he says he needs to hold her in his hand and be ready to destroy her and this is what L plans to do with the narrator who secretly wants to be destroyed. L is very manipulative. She also wants to destroy herself. She needs actual violence in her last ditch effort to be free.
- True artists minimize their inner reality early on so they know so much about life but so little about themselves. She is seeing herself and evolving herself over time. How dreadful knowing the truth is when it can actually help you. The artists must be amoral and free of personal bias. Life works to inform our biases so we accept our fate so the artists must be extra vigilant to avoid the temptations and hear the call of truth when it comes. That call of truth is the easiest to miss and ignore and the temptation to deny it remains constant. People rather take care of themselves before the truth and the truth passes them by. The artists denies themselves for greatness but that makes them miserable. To live outside of time makes you immortal. L parades his freedom and it makes her less free. He never wants to grow up and wants to live outside of him. Fathers make painters and women makes writers. He values choice and desire over acceptance and fate. He has no duty cannot conceive of obligation. He shows her how much she let her life be defined by others. Cultural feels of denial and repression. L feels like she isn’t allowing herself to be a woman she says no one is allowing her to. She thinks no one showed her how but she feels like she needs permission. Tony knows more about reality than anyone despite seeming like a brute he’s actually very enlightened
- Tony wants her to take pleasure in her life and be happy that she felt like her entire life postponed so she could have pleasure later but now when the bill comes due, she realizes that she wasn’t storing pleasure because that’s impossible and you just must be happy in the moment because that’s the only time you can experience pleasure is in the moment. The narrator cannot sympathize with how difficult Bret situation is because she can’t even sympathize with herself. L is going through a lot of changes and the art market is rough and he’s reckoning his place in the universe right now. Bret is this rich woman who has so much she never feels motivated but also hangs with L and how she uses her rich uncle who would molest her and then sell L painting to him and get her money, interesting take on the a female perespective. She drawn to the rebellion in L. People can get annoyed by too much honesty. Feels separation not composed of distance but impassablity.
- Change is also loss. Apparently this is the child every day with their changing so you can’t worry about what they’re gonna become. You have to focus on what’s right in front of you. Kurt is demanding of Justine and talks down to her she slavishly serves him like the narrator was afraid and serves Tony. Tony isn’t Justine’s father. When you don’t have kids or family, you’re free to love whoever. Justine and Bret become close the mom hates Bret but she shows her how much Justine is like her. Brett is showing Justine the world through her eyes and only the way that an older influence, but not a parent can. She saw fear masquerading as common sense. Kurt never wanted her to do things because he felt like she would run away, and she never wanted to learn until she met bret who opened her eyes. She was turning her back on risk and adventure but now turned to embrace it. Justine is separating herself from Kurt and questioning his control over her. The mom sees her inability to do this at the time and sees Justine’s surpassing her. her husband and Kurt were weak men men always feel more stronger and powerful than they are. Men are never weak sometimes they use their power for good other times deception. So much of power is seeing how willing people are to give power to you and now she sees the fake power of her ex-husband in Kurt. She could never have anyone tell her what to do. She hated doing medial tasks because she felt that her life would become pointless and ordinary when she said too many of them, but she woke up every every day ready to seize the world, but never doing so.
- She felt like she could let go in front of L and like her whole life was forcing her to control herself, but she finally allowed her to be free with herself. Saw L was the first integrated being he doesn’t have to separate his life into different areas. She felt like she could cry and was truly seen by him. She wanted to insnare L but couldn’t she had to allow him to be a free integrated person. He couldn’t be controlled. Imperceptible change that makes you feel like you are becoming with nature. Controlling others and being your whole self she felt very seen very vulnerable. Dreadfully free. L needs to feel free and all of the people he knew who constructed houses either exploded in them or they acted as plaster casts. Cannot be constrained rejected society could not be contained. He took from death the impulse to live. The death around and give him confirmation of his own being. This confronting death gave him a feeling of equality of all things. This was also an ability to survive all things. Death could not touch him and his survival was freedom. She feels the constant need to rebel. He is giving her his backstory. She tries to give him hers and he listens and then passess it on like she isn’t worthy to talk yet. We can run some reality, but it happens with or without us so we might as well confront it. L wants to paint Tony or her daughter she is unseen. By him. Bret is a bitch and always complains encroaching on personal space she is female perfection and expects everything to be given to her.
- Tony refuses to see things as games and this reveals how often everyone else is playing games. Our whole concept of love derives from the subjectivity of the game playing state. Tony is practical and didn’t want to have fun just common sense and practicality and the woman wants to have fun. She doesn’t know why she does what she does and what freedom is. The trained finger of the pianist is more enslaved than the heart of the music lover. Life rarely allows us to be free in more than one way which is why artists are bad people. L was able to adapt with the changing tastes and time by never surrendering to them in the first place. Artists read the surface of life you can feel closer to creation and god when you see art mirrored in the real world. L gains control from his inability to be controlled. Control comes from surrender. She gives in and cannot be controlled gives into the heat and passion of the situation.
- When people try to paint the marsh they always paint the contents of their mind trying to find an exception in it when they should want to paint the deep motion and truth in the marsh. The artist has never felt more alone than in New York. When you embellish you set others up for disappointment but end up really disappointing yourself. Tony doesn’t criticize anyone and sees this woman for who she is. Her identity is formed around her critical view of herself so by his lack of criticism she in part loses her sense of self but he won’t criticize her even when she wants. When people marry young they are together and must be pulled apart and can’t exist alone but when they marry later it’s a fusing of 2 individuals together. Meeting of 2 formed distinct things. She is different than Tony and they recognize that. A view has a spiritual significance to Tony when they eat they eat the marsh as well. When you finally realize who you are you have a kid then get thrown back into dispair. She’s burned by the tormenting sense of freedom. This woman feels like she needs to talk to feel real and her husband feels like her heart is always talking to her. Talking allows us to poison ourselves. The artist is trying to lower her because he’s afraid of her. The artist can create a perfect replica of their own intentions outside of themselves the rest of us just create a mess. To take on the work of fate is to incur responsibility for its consequences.
- Fear is a habit and habits kill what is essential in us. When we let someone else do it we lose control of our own destinies. I was desperate for love from any source I truly was a dog. She meets an egotist who thinks he’s sly but isn’t. Gives her plenty of rope to hang him with but she decides against it and plays along. Why do we live so painfully in our fictions and suffer so much from the things we’ve invented. She’s wanted to be free her whole life but hasn’t even freed her smallest toe. Her only freedom is when she does nothing. Weightlessness of important love that shows you that you exist. She struggled to demand what she needs and allows people to run ahead and trample her in crowds. She’s a young mother on the brink of rebellion who’s inspired by the masculine nature and freedom of these paintings. Women try to understand male freedom. She is falling out of the frame of her life and embracing a new frame. She’s no longer emerced in her life but distinct from it and realizes she’s along in life. She believes she’s been created by the criticism in her life somehow that criticism is more real than she is. She’s created by criticism. To understand words can stop those words from living.
