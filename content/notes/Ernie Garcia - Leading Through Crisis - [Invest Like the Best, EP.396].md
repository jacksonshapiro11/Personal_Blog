### Highlights

- Vertical Integration Drives Financial Advantage
  Summary:
  Vertical integration enhances financial performance by allowing companies to capture a greater share of economics from transactions.
  It facilitates better project management through defined milestones across product, operational, and financial domains. By breaking down projects into granular weekly targets and fostering a culture of accountability, organizations can adapt more quickly, mitigate conflicts, and optimize resource allocation.
  This approach not only emphasizes the importance of deep engagement from all levels of the team but also cultivates a sense of momentum that makes project management enjoyable.
  The creation of a rigorous operating cadence with regular check-ins further sharpens focus and accelerates progress, setting the stage for sustained improvements in efficiency and effectiveness.

  So now let's assume we've said yes to some project or something that you're working on. The project management methodology, that frequency with which you check in on projects has started to become a thing of legend. If you ask around about Carvana, can you talk about how it works today? I'm a new person in the organization. I come to you, you're teaching me how to project manage here at Carvana. What would you tell me?
  Speaker 1
  So I think the goal was to take the extra focus that existed in the company that meant that now you had small rooms that were making decisions right now all the time, and then create maximum Accountability to ensure that we were making the hard decisions that we needed to make. We were recognizing when things weren't working the way that we wanted them to, and we were adjusting course rapidly. In the moments where we were saying yes to things, the way that we would hold ourselves accountable, we've got a great team of strong, intelligent people. They were always working hard. They're always holding themselves accountable. But I think the way we were holding ourselves accountable was more about, are we getting the project done? It was like, we designed a project. We imagined what the answer would be. Are we getting it done? If the answer was yes, we felt like that was good. I think that when we went through the more difficult period and we said no to more things, we said, let's take the project. Let's convert the project into milestones from a product perspective. Let's convert that into milestones where we think it's going to impact ops from an operations perspective, where we think we can get operationally more efficient. And then let's convert that into financial milestones where we think getting better operationally is going to flow into dollars and cents. And let's try to break that down, those three steps, project, operations, and then financial impact. Let's try to break them down as granularly as we can, and let's create weekly targets for ourselves. And that exercise is a little burdensome. You got to be careful that that exercise doesn't become the bureaucracy that you want to avoid so that you can get things done. But the benefit of that is once you have it, and you create these weekly meetings where you're having conversations, and you're checking in on how are we doing versus these three measures, Product, and financial, there's no hiding. When you're missing things, you have to say why. And maybe your expectations were wrong at the beginning. And that's in a way, unfortunate, but that's the easiest one to address. But more often than not, you start to realize that a lot of the conversations that you're having are, well, it's because we're also trying to work on this. And this person that we need for this is tied up on that because they got called into this other project for whatever reason. And all of a sudden, when you dive all the way into the absolute granular detail of exactly what's happening every single day, the cost of those conflicts becomes so much more apparent. And it gets a lot easier to then say, okay, that means that across the company, there's still too many yeses and we need to say no to more things. And that's going to accelerate us. Or we need to adjust course a little bit on this project. This didn't quite work out the way we want it to, but we still think the idea is good and maybe need to alter the product a little bit given whatever learning we just had. But it creates a very rapid feedback cycle. So we starting in 22, we started this operating cadence where basically all of our major clusters, which are the various operating groups in the company. We started to have these weekly meetings, generally on Mondays, although some are different days of the week, but Mondays primarily when we have them, where we would just say, okay, What are the key projects we're working on? How are we doing against our project milestones, our operational milestones, our financial milestones every single week? And what are we going to change? And that doesn't sound that innovative. But I think pairing that with focus and then extreme accountability and resolve on the part of everyone in the team to make sure that we hit the numbers. With, by the way, pressure from the outside world because we had to get better fast. It just created a very productive environment where I think we got a lot more done than we ever had. So I think that's something that we're going to seek to maintain for as long as we possibly can.
  Speaker 2
  And we're going to seek to replace the outside pressure, which I do think is a big part of it, with internal pressure, which I think is very hard to ever make as powerful as outside pressure. But that's our goal. Does it get exhausting doing that? Does checking in, assuming you're personally managing a bunch of projects, as are many of the senior team, et cetera, does it get tiring checking in on people multiple times a day or Week? Does that feel sustainable?
  Speaker 1
  So here's another thing that I think is different about startups versus big companies. Hierarchy, I think, is a disaster. I think there's a big misconception inside of all of corporate America that moving up in an organization with up generally being defined as climbing the corporate ladder and getting Further away from doing things is progress. And I think that in reality, you want your leaders to be player coaches. But the player part of that is tremendously important. And the coaching part of that, the most important part of coaching is basically just leading by example. It's what you do every day. You want your best people to be deep in the weeds of every project. Ideally, you're sitting there with engineers and designers and the people that are actually impacting the product on the ground and the operators that are doing things. So you see reality every day instead of operating at levels of abstraction that are just way less predictive of where things are going. So I think we really try to push people to go deep. At all the various levels inside Carvano, we try to push people to go deep. And you could call that exhausting if it starts to feel like it's the boss checking in. But if it starts to feel like it's a member of the team enthusiastically being involved in the project every day, and you pair that with a bunch of rapid progress, all of a sudden, it's Fun. It's fun to go check in on those projects. My favorite thing, I love it when it's like Sunday night and I'm excited about my couple Monday morning check-ins because I know the stuff that people were kicking off over the weekend. We're gonna get to check in on Monday. Whenever you feel like that, that's because momentum is addictive. It's contagious. And I think that the more that you can get into the weeds of actually moving the real business forward and then being a part of that every day, it's almost the opposite of laborious. I think it becomes really fun and it creates its own momentum.
  Speaker 2
  Can we go back all the way to the Odessa acquisition and talk through what was going on, what you saw, why you did it, and the role that a big decision like that you think can play in the trajectory
  Speaker 1
  Of Carvana? Well, first, I'll say I think one of the areas ... ([Time 0:29:48](https://share.snipd.com/snip/718102aa-7a6e-445d-b40a-f09357191c91))

- Success is Human: Embrace Your Fallibility
  Summary:
  Investors possess valuable intelligence shaped by their extensive experience and ability to match patterns across numerous companies.
  While entrepreneurs may not have exposure to as many businesses, learning from investors' insights can aid growth. However, entrepreneurs must also recognize the inherent anxiety investors face due to their lack of direct control over operations, which can lead to ineffective decision-making based on fear.
  It's essential for entrepreneurs not to delegate their emotional reactions to investors’ opinions, especially during times of market fluctuation.
  The success of a company often hinges on the ability to maintain focus and not allow external worries to disrupt internal confidence.
  A critical lesson for entrepreneurs is to see investors as human beings, who, despite their success, also make mistakes and experience uncertainties. Recognizing that successful individuals share the same human vulnerabilities can inspire confidence and reinforce the understanding that success is attainable through resilience and learning from one’s experiences.

  Speaker 1
  I think investors are very smart. I think there's a massive selection effect for intelligence and not just intelligence, but outcome. I think that convincing people you're right and being right are actually reasonably separable things. And I think given enough time, being right is identified in investors. And so I think that they end up being the kind of smart that is real, as opposed to like the articulate sound right kind of smart. I think that investors have pattern matching, to use that cheesy term, where you as an entrepreneur, you're never going to be able to be inside of 50 companies. You're never going to have enough time to really deeply study 50 companies. But every investor necessarily is going to study at least that many companies over their career. So I think that they have a perspective that you oftentimes don't have. I also think that investors, they're inherently handcuffed. They don't have access to the levers of the machine. And the distance from those levers, we talked earlier about knowing the plan creates a calm confidence because I know what I have to do. You have a marching plan. Investors don't get to do that. Investors come sit in a room and talk to you and they try to figure out what your marching plan is. And then they go away and they fret. That distance from levers, I think, creates a little bit of anxiety that I think is one of the skills that investors have to create. Some are good at it and some aren't, which is they have to manage that anxiety. Their version of peace has to be, I'm accepting that this management team has a plan and that they're going to go march and try to get that done. And I'm putting my faith in them. And I'm going to go walk away and think about something else for a while now. Because I think that that distance from those levers creates anxiety. And I think anxiety is a very ineffective and unproductive emotion that causes you to start generating alternative stories fit whatever it is that you're observing. And I think it's very easy to make bad decisions when your anxious brain is generating new stories to fit the data. And I think I would tell entrepreneurs, you can't blame them for that. The way that you learn from the world around you is you try to find what the world's right about. There's a version of smart that I think is very unhelpful, which is the version that always listens for where other people are wrong and then condescendingly corrects them. That's not helpful. The version of smart that is helpful is listen to people and try to figure out where they're right. What is the thing that they're saying that you may not have known before where they're right? And who cares if 95% of what they said is wrong? If there's 5% of what they said that's right, you just grew. You just got better. And I think that investors, they are very smart and they do have pattern matching and they have a history that you don't have. So try to learn from them. But also, this would be the last piece of advice. I think people that have never had exposure to investors, investors can feel like this master of the universe class of individuals that know things that no one else knows. So it can be easy on days when your stock price goes down for all the people that are sitting in an office in Phoenix, Arizona to think investors know stuff that we don't know. They're smarter than us. And that can cause you to question things you shouldn't question. And I think that you need to set up the company to know, hey, the history of success is that at some point, investors fret. At some point, they're going to panic. And in the examples from history that are successful, oftentimes that fretting is proven wrong. So when that inevitably happens, don't worry about it. Make sure you pay attention and try to learn from it, but don't let it control your emotional state. Don't outsource your emotions to people that you don't know who know less about this than you do.
  Speaker 2
  What a great line. This may be an aside that we take out, but I just genuinely am curious. What have you learned from your dad about business and building things? And obviously, been a huge part of Carvana. I worked with my dad for a long time, 15 years. What have you learned from or from working with your dad?
  Speaker 1
  So here's what I'd say. I think there's a lot there. He was our initial investor and he is today remains our biggest investor. So his role is big investor, which is actually like a relatively limited role from an actual company operating perspective. But then for me, he's dad, which is obviously an enormous role. So what would I say? I think there's so many directions to go there. Here's one thing. My dad's a very capable person. I think he's got a broad skillset. And I think I was lucky to observe that in action throughout my life. But then what I would also say is my dad, like everyone else on this planet, is a human. And one of the lessons that I think is most valuable and that I think is most transferable to everyone listening to this, because everyone else isn't going to have a dad that, short story, My family was pretty successful. I didn't even know it when I was a little kid, went through personal bankruptcy when I was eight or nine or 10, through middle school and early in high school, I think was doing fine and Coming back. And then by the time I was late in high school, I was very successful. But I think for most of that, I didn't realize any of it. I was just a kid. I had no idea. They did a great job sheltering me, I think, from even caring about those things or knowing that it was going on. But then by the time I was later in high school, I was obviously aware that my family had done pretty well and my dad was very successful. And I think that something that I think is a lesson that is enormously valuable is just seeing him as a human every day and knowing that he is a person. He makes mistakes. He says things that are wrong. He's right a lot, but he's wrong a lot. And he's just a human being. Being able to see someone that close and personal every day that has a level of success where you see other people look at him and imagine that he's something different. You see them laugh too hard at his jokes that are funny, but not that funny. And you see them nod too hard when he says something, it's right, but not that right. And you see that they imagine that he's something superhuman, but you know, he's just a human. That gives you confidence that you can do it too. Because we all know that we're just human, right? I know that I'm just a human. I know I make mistakes all the time. You know it, everyone knows it. But we imagine sometimes that people that are really successful are different than us. And I think being able to live a whole life with someone who is very successful and see that it's attainable, I think is enormously confidence inspiring. That's something that I wish the whole world could get. A very small subset of the world is going to get to get that kind of ...
