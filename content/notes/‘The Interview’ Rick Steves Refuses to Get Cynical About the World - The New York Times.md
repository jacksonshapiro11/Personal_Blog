### Highlights

- **A Catholic idea very popular in the 1980s, that you help the poor, that you try to give liberation through spiritual teaching. Romero was assassinated.** Right. And I was due for a vacation. I was fried, I was tired. I wanted to go somewhere with my family, and we were dreaming about Mazatlán. A pristine stretch of tropical beach swept free of local riffraff, little plastic straps on our wrists so we can get all the drinks we want without dirtying our fingers with the local currency — it was going to be a beautiful, hedonistic, relaxing vacation on a beach in Mexico. And then my friend said: It’s the 25th anniversary of the assassination of Archbishop Romero. We’re going to march on the streets of San Salvador — do you want to join us? And I told my family, I’m going to be no fun on the beach. And it was one of the most valuable travel experiences I’ve ever had, to be there on the streets of San Salvador, eating beans and rice one day and rice and beans the next, covered in bug bites, marching with peasants to remember a slain leader. I was in my glory as a traveler there. Lulu, I’m in this sort of thing in my teaching where I remind people there’s three kinds of travel: You can travel as a tourist, a traveler or a pilgrim.
  **Explain the third one.** Most travelers I know, they’re proud to be known as a traveler as opposed to a tourist: “I’m more thoughtful — I’m not just here to shop and get a selfie. I’m here to immerse myself in the culture and learn.” That is a traveler, to become a temporary local. A traveler learns about the world, but I think a pilgrim learns about themselves, and you learn about yourself by leaving your home and looking at it from a distance. You learn about yourself, I think, by trying to get close to God in your travels. I mean, for me the greatest church is walking on a ridge high in the Alps. The last thing a Lutheran’s going to do is raise their arms to the heavens, but I feel like doing that when I’m on top of an Alp! You just feel so good, and you just feel like this world is such a beautiful place, and it’s filled with beautiful people, and nature is so fragile, and it’s such a delight and a blessing. It changes you. It becomes pretty clear when you travel that we’re all in this together.
  **The philosophy is beautiful, this idea of communion with the world, connection with other people. But there is a shift happening in the world right now, toward isolationism, nativism, a fundamental suspicion of difference. We’re in a world that travels more than it ever has, and yet what seems to be happening is not what you would hope.** More people are traveling than ever before, but there’s not more *transformational* travel than ever before. There’s this superficial Instagram, TripAdvisor kind of travel. It’s very interesting: In Europe, I find different places where suddenly, inexplicably, there’s a mob of people. What’s going on? Oh, that’s where everybody stands to get their selfie with the Matterhorn behind them. I was just in Zermatt, and there’s a construction project going on. I asked the locals there in this little Swiss town below the Matterhorn, what are they building here? Well, the Instagram people were clogging the bridge so people couldn’t cross the bridge when they’re going to work, so we’re making a platform so they can actually stand there and not obstruct traffic. It’s beyond me. I don’t get it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg9jd5svg6gfdeavs6aq6hzm))
    - **Note:** Traveling where it isn’t just exploring beautiful places but learning from new and interesting cultures. Engaging across a difference.
