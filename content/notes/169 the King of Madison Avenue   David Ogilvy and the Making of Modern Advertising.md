  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  His early life that i want to pull out, but i've found a couple of sections on his personality that i think telling you up front in case this is your first introduction to the legend and the genius that is david ogravy, that'll give you a good ideaof why he's such a person and somebody that we should all learn from. So last week, or i gess in the bonus episode last week, we talked about am. There's this phrase from that book freedom's forge that talks about henry kaiser, and they called him a suction cup because he would constantly, would just milk everybody around him for any useful information that they had.
  Speaker 2
  David is very much like that.
  Speaker 1
  Sam walton, i was also the same it was also the same way. And so this section talks a little bit about that personality, at the aspect of david ogery's personality. So says, one characteristic of geniuses, said einstein, is that they are passionately curious.
  Speaker 2
  Ogovy's great secret was an inquiring mind in conversation. He neverpontificated. He interrogated at dinner with a copywriter and her husband who worked in the oil business. Ogovy quizzed the man at length about the oil sit in the middle east. A woman who sat next to him at dinner said that by dessert, he knew more about her than her mother. He would pump people for information. So not only would he do this in conversation, but he also understood that eot the value of reading, and that nothing can actually substitute for it. So saysa a zealous student of the business, ogovy claimed that he had read every book about advertising and dis this is an important part. And disdained others who felt they didn't need this knowledge.
  Speaker 1
  So in other books, he doesn't mince words about this. He says, if you're not, if you're failing to study the history of your profession, if you're not reading as much as possible, he calls you an ignorant amateur.
  Speaker 2
  Ah, there were piles of books all over his house. ([Time 0:03:56](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3255ed2c-6fe7-4a26-a465-8cac06fa8e8e))
    - **Note:** He was passionately curious he never pontificated he investigated and learned from anyone he was with. He read every advertising book he could and called those who didn’t read ignorant amateurs he wanted to learn everything he could from a person or experience he had a deep thirst for knowledge. He’s a formidable individual. Respect for being smart and capable. Deep commitment to learning but had flaws especially in finance. His grandpa turned him onto jp mprgan hiring men with brains and first class business in a first class way. His dad was more of an accidemic and his grandpa was a man of execution and action. David idolized his grandpa not his dad. Scholar not a business man vs his grandpa being hard as nails. David was never a good student and only excelled after he developed his personal curriculum. School shouldn’t tell you facts but inspire scholarship and love of learning Edwin lande also believed this. In college he was a failure and unmotivated starts his company at 40 and becomes the best advertising man ever. All his success was not a result of formal schooling he figured it out later. He learned first at a French kitchen that instilled excellence in every area every posture. This lead to his business philosophy that prioritized excellence. Do the little things right and the score takes care of itself. He learned so much here about being great.

    - **Note:** He got a job as a salesperson and this set his career off. He espoused the virtues of marketing yourself and selling/ giving things away free. He has a menical desire for learning. He always. Came back to the fundamentals learn the first principles and base system then scale from there. Jordan and Kobe were working not on flash but just fundamentals. He became an amazing writer because he wrote all the time. Practice as the key input to learning. He went to the us and wanted to learn from the best shoot for the best and the greats just know and do more. He learned from the man who would become his competitor they had lunch once a week and he just closed his mouth and listened for years. Reaves showed him Claude Hopkins books are the original links. This booo became too valuable to publish and was locked in a safe for years because it was too valuable. Advertising isn’t about art it’s about results. You first need to deeply understand the market you’re working in. Market research became vital for David’s success. Success is not a straight line David had to resign from Gallup which taught him about market research to fight in WW2 and he works for the guy who was the inspiration for James bond. He learned the terse memo here where his boss would respond to all notes with yes no or speak. After the war he lives with the Amish.

    - **Note:** Ogilvy started his own agency with little experience and no one would’ve likely hired him he was starting the American office of a brittish firm and proved to be formidable he built it from the ground up staring at 0 and looking fir gentleman with brains. He set incredibly high standards from day 1 and rarely praised so to not devalue his word. Extremely persistent and very direct and brief. He never gave up on an idea. He used aphorisms to condense his points. No statues of commitees pay peanuts get monkeys. Vivid metaphors. He hated laziness everything not amazing is bad. He made ads 20x as good as his competitors. He was incredibly successful there was so much variance in success that companies flocked toward success. His ads were so successful his customers had to add more capacity. Tail upsides. In 5 years he became great but it really was the summation of his life and 5 years of application. He was a loving legend. He had main character energy. He wrote 100 pieces of copy for rolles Royce he just did so much there was bound to be a good ad in there. He pulled the eventual ad from an 20 year old manual on page 100 something that said at 70 mph the loudest thing was the clock. That’s dedication and research don’t fool yourself about what success demands. He became mentally crushed and afraid of failure for many years he had to work harder as a result but mentally this somewhat destroyed him and set him backwards.
- He was very intentional about company culture and wanted to create an enduring institution. The culture was very intentionally and he surrounded himself with people who had high standards. He was incredibly focused by 1 thing advertising and making money. He knew his worth and turned down clients. His adventures of an advertising man is the best book on advertising ever. He worked 9-12 3 wives didn’t have much of a life and regretted this later. Buffet made more money buying his company than he did. He thought he needed to acquire competitors but he should’ve further invested in the best aka himself. They created an intentional culture with a mission and strong culture. Tough but fun agency. He looked at all the ads for the last 20 years then started doing market research then wrote 20 headlines to throw away then started writing no one was doing this he had no competition. He was an amazing writer but he thought he was a better editor than writer. He kept it very short and readable. His brilliance was his simplicity. Ogilvy lost control and this destroyed him. He messed up by losing control and agency. Steal from the best. His philosophy was we sell or else and let his good ideas compound.
