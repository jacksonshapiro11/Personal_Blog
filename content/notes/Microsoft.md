- Pdp 10 is disrupting ibm mainframes leading to cheap compute bills high school is the only one in the country who has access to this. When you used a computer you wrote code at this time you couldn’t do anything else. Bill learned basic started to become entrepreneurial in his young age realized that a language that make computers easier could be the way of the future. Went to Harvard realized he couldn’t do theoretical math and decided to do something more applied. His parents were massively successful too just right place and time constantly super smart. Sees computation is exponentially growing and realizes he needed to ride the wave given how rare that was. Bill was bred to be a giant successful business man and met the right people and industry to make it happen. They see the micro processors realize the future of computers is here they thought they had even missed it. Computers on every desk was crazy concept. They see the power and decide to make this big effort attack the market. ([Time 0:33:42](https://share.snipd.com/snip/854f581f-fd0f-4e49-9aa5-1ae3acc6cfd7))

    - **Note:** He’s at the right place and time understands his skills and has the resources to gain leverage in society realizes he can be the best at computing not math and sees it exponentially growing. Takes an opportunity always bred to be a business man. Rides the wave. They see the power have a crazy idea and bet big they thought they missed it. Markets always bigger than you think.
- They finally see a computer that costs $400 people can use and they offer to write a basic interpreter and it works they finalize it in a few weeks. Then they finish it in writing on the plane without testing realizing they forgot something. Both these companies come out of nowhere to help shape the world. Microsoft was the only people to say they could emulate basic and actually follow through. This is the first sale of software. It gets pirated because it wasn’t yet protected by copyright original agreement is with the company to distribute exclusively altair they learn from this in the future. This pc was also a bet the company move from Altair that worked. They basically gave it away to everyone for cheap to get platform lock in before anyone else can undercut them. Microsoft bought dos for $75k did deal with ibm this makes them billions. Put work in but still. This was the OS until 95 they didn’t even know they needed an OS IBM asked so they did it. They gave dos to ibm for 310k but in doing so gave them full lock in as the central focus of the industry everyone used dos so they needed it more than they needed ibm now. This is maybe the best deal made in business history gives them all the power. IBM just didn’t see how the insurer would change.

    - **Note:** Microsoft had complete power due to gaining lock in at the OS level with DOS. This is a crazy story of taking opportunities to shape the world. Right place and time they backed up their talk and got network effects. Rode this wave on the back of suppliers and learned from past business for future sucesses
- Microsoft works very closely with Apple to develop excel then word. They use what’s going on at Parc xerox to see guis are the future and better interaction is key. This is really one of the first killer apps for people to use easily without needing programming knowledge. They sell this as a suite first invention of software suite. Everything was just so early they’re birthing this industry. They didn’t know what kind of company they knew they were a computing company but wheather that was os or software they didn’t know they were trying everything right place and time just maximizing shots on goal. They made a mouse for one program. Microsoft still had to work with ibm they were masters at hedging their bets while keeping ibm happy. Playing both sides really. Ibm wants to recentralize microsoft does this for them while also arming the rebels and eventually the rebels win they’re playing both sides ibm was scared to disrupt themselves and this leaded to them losing. Windows 3.0 is the come to Jesus moment when Microsoft starts to believe they’re the best. Before this it was stilll ibm they were trying things but this moment crossed the chasm they were now big brother and in charge. Building an ecosystem. Windows was a rag tag group in the company became the company and computing moved into the next era. ([Time 2:32:05](https://share.snipd.com/snip/069c8cd5-30ae-4963-a64e-09d3e3fb152b))

    - **Note:** Masters at diversified bets and heding their bets. Workign with partners and leveraging them. They were inventing SaaS everything was just so fresh and new Right place right time maxmimizing shots on goal. Arming the IBM was arming the rebels. Microsoft started as a rag tag group then they realized one day they crossed the chasm and were dominant.
- Microsoft's Secret Weapon in Enterprise Competition
  Summary:
  The Microsoft-IBM divorce in 1990 allowed Microsoft to enter the enterprise space with Microsoft Office as its secret weapon.
  Microsoft's success was attributed to the widespread use and love for Microsoft Office among employees. This approach of product-led growth was not new, with Microsoft pioneering it by catering to employees' preferences for Excel and Word.
  Microsoft's shift to centralized selling enabled them to capitalize on the existing usage of Microsoft Office within businesses, thus transforming from retail sales to legitimate enterprise clientele.

  Speaker 1
  And how it actually goes down and we sort of heard this from Steve and you heard it from other people is so fitting. So by the end of 1990, the Microsoft IBM divorce is official. IBM takes full control of OS two development back from Microsoft. Microsoft sees his involvement. The breakup is official. This now gives Microsoft and Steve hunting license in the enterprise to go compete against IBM, but they have a secret weapon that is going to enable them to come take the enterprise From IBM and then tell us what it is.
  Speaker 2
  Well, it's painfully obvious. It's Microsoft Office and it's the fact that the whole workforce is already using Microsoft Office and everyone loves to talk about product lead growth and how it's this new thing in The late 2010s and how slack and Atlassian and Trello, everyone figured out PLG and this bottoms up workforce adopted way rather than selling to procurement or IT or the central administrator And it's just not new. No, this has always been the case and Microsoft invented it. All the employees wanted to use Excel and Word and they just had to figure it. They were doing it anyway. And at some point, Microsoft needed to figure out how to take advantage of selling it centrally and how you do business with other businesses rather than selling resilient retail copies Of people who are using it kind of illegally for their work.
  Speaker 1
  There's so many things that are beautiful about this. One, it's the legacy of this bet on the Mac and bet on Excel and then on Windows, shortly thereafter, ([Time 3:06:52](https://share.snipd.com/snip/40b89ab2-0da2-423e-a78d-0f7a38accaf4))
    - **Note:** Microsoft then realizes they need to take the next step and build out their enterprise sales force and balmer builds this out. They need to do a lot of education and building before they perfect this. This becomes the company but it really started with product lead growth and the idea being demanded by employees so Microsoft had to figure out how to go to employers. Microsoft got a little more serious and started shipping enterprise grade software created a new strategy of one evolving platform started hiring more senior people legitimacy. One evolving architecture a couple implementations and immense amount of applications is the strategy. When they launched window 95 the marketing was so good Coke reached out to them for marketing advice it was the golden age of the pc and people were lining up around the block for this operating system they called it Chicago to give it this familiar but accessible feel. They became the way you used the computer
- Embrace and Incorporate Good Ideas Efficiently
  Summary:
  Copying successful features from existing products can lead to better risk-adjusted returns by knowing what will work before launching.
  Incorporating proven concepts and making software transition easy can be a successful strategy for businesses, even if not the first to the market with innovative ideas.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  In most cases, you think about the strategy that they had early on spread sheets, word processing, all these were copycats at their outset. I mean, sometimes they would do an acquisition, but most of the time they would just look at a product and say, huh, our software should do the same thing. And they would copy it. They had no shame in doing that. They had their eyes everywhere looking for good ideas and they had reverence for the good ones, and then they would just incorporate them. And on top of that, they wanted to make the software very easy to switch to. So a lot of the keyboard shortcuts in Excel to this day are there because they were originally the Lotus one, two, three shortcuts and they wanted people to have the same muscle memory That just worked. So fundamentally, what this does for you as a business is it just leads to better risk adjusted returns. You already know what's going to work before you ship it. You don't really take market risk. So you're not going to be the first to the market with early adopters, but most of the time you actually don't need to be to win. And I think Microsoft, I don't know, they sort of own that idea. Most of the time people are sheepish about it. Steve Jobs famously said Microsoft has no taste. I think that's another way to put it, that it's copycatting.
  Speaker 1
  Well, so I do agree with your premise with all of this. I think doing this episode though has made me think there's a little more nuance to it. Yes. ([Time 3:50:26](https://share.snipd.com/snip/398d75d4-44c5-4e83-89eb-7ca8b3d28bc3))
    - **Note:** Microsoft copied ruthlessly had a great international strategy rode a wave right place and time. And that wave was just so big it never stopped 98% cagr for pc growth and they were the lynchpin in pc. Software is never done constantly integrating consumer feedback and shipping updates. They were super ambitious and audacious and they slowly started to believe they could change the world and build up belief then grew it eventually they did it. Belief in own agency
