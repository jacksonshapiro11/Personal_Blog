### Highlights

  This led to being shy but compensating through overachieving in school from a young age. Despite being intelligent, there was aversion to authority.
  The individual excelled in academics effortlessly, skipping two grades, while displaying mischievous behavior in school - a common thread seen in successful entrepreneurs.

  And one of the reasons that he identified Jim as the person he wanted to sell Price Call Up To later on was the fact that he thought Jim was a world-class operator. And fantastic at execution, which everybody obviously that's running to Jim has agreed with. So I just, but before I get into the ideas and where he like his ideas for his company building philosophy, I want to just touch on a few things in his early life. This is something that's very common. He was a misfit. He just felt the need to prove himself through achievements. So Soul is talking about he had a physical deformity. So when you look at pictures throughout his book, the older he gets the, like his one of his eyes, essentially looks like it's almost permanently closed. And it started drooping when he was a young man and he gave him a lot of like, he was self-conscious about it. So he says when I was three or four years old, I had an affirmative. And my left eye that caused a drooping eyelid. It was something that bothered me and made me self-conscious. The kids teased me a lot. And consequently, I was shy and compensated for this. This is the most important sentence. I was shy and compensated for this by being an overachiever in school, even at a young age. Soul was very intelligent, but he also had like an aversion to being told what to do. Being an overachiever meant reading at an early age, holding his own with adults in chess, and doing well in school without really trying. Soul skipped two grades, but he was mischievous in school. This is this sentence made me think of the greatest description of an entrepreneur. ([Time 0:09:10](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7a9b58d2-e1a1-40a0-b7c0-5f66a353e264))
    - **Note:** If you want to study the entrepreneur study the juvenile delinquent. Sol was incredibly smart and had a deformity which pushed him to compensate in other areas which made him great.
- The Importance of a Supportive Spouse in Entrepreneurship
  Summary:
  Having a supportive spouse is crucial in entrepreneurship as it provides constant belief and support, making a significant difference in the lonely journey of being a founder.
  The unwavering support from a spouse can serve as a pillar of strength, even without grand gestures or speeches. Selecting the right life partner is vital, as seen in the story of a young attorney who learned the value of providing free value to build his client base, emphasizing that true education comes from the practical experiences of life.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Tabby never voiced a single doubt. Her support was a constant. This reminds me of sole prices, wife. This is what I'm writing to you. Her support was a constant. One of the few things I could take as a given. And whenever I see a first novel dedicated to a wife or a husband, I smile and think there's someone who knows writing is a lonely job. Entrepreneurship is a lonely job. I talked to, I'm going to wind up talking to more founders and almost anybody else alive. And that comes up on earlier. Being a founder is extremely lonely job. Having someone who believes in you makes a lot of difference. They don't need to make speeches. They don't have to make speeches. Just believing is usually enough. And so sole in probably life's most important is that you pick the right spouse. I'm going to fast forward. He went to law school. And it's interesting to me, there's so much about reading soul's experience as a young lawyer that reminded me of Charlie Munger. And so sole has a line right at the beginning of this chapter that describes his very short law career. And he says, over a period of time, I really learned far more from like my clients than I ever learned in law school. Reminding me of one of my favorite quotes by Henry Ford, that true education is gained through the discipline of life. And so I just want to pull out one idea that I think is very valuable. He's a young attorney, has no money, doesn't really have a client base. So how's he going to build up and like his own, like his own business, his own book of business, right? He gets clients for his law firm by giving away value for free first. ([Time 0:14:46](https://share.snipd.com/snip/667773b5-3792-4ab7-8614-71e5b05949e4))
    - **Note:** Sol had a chaotic family life but sought a great spose and having that great suppport allowed him the comfort to grow and be successful. He was a lawyer first and always had a big chip on his shoulder. Education comes through the trials and tribulations of life. Being a founder is lonely you need great support. Father was lazy and sol took that as an anti model.
- Adjusting to Blackouts and Developing a Strong Work Ethic during the War
  Summary:
  During the war, faced with sudden blackouts every night, individuals had to navigate in darkness, which created challenges in transportation.
  Despite these difficulties, individuals persevered and found ways to keep moving forward. One individual, in addition to his legal work during the day, supported the war effort at night by working at an aircraft company.
  This experience marked the beginning of his strong work ethic as he found fulfillment in working hard and being productive.
  He maintained a rigorous schedule, working from early morning until late at night without complaint, unlike his father who avoided work.
  The adversity he faced during this time shaped his mindset, leading him to thrive when busy and productive, contrary to his earlier years of not working hard. This period of hardship ultimately contributed to developing a dedicated work ethic and a newfound appreciation for hard work and productivity.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  All of a sudden, there were total blackouts every night. It's hard to even recall now how inconvenient it was trying to get around after dark without lights in your car, without any lights in the street, and trying to figure out where you were Going and how to get there. It was a very, very difficult thing, but somehow we still managed to keep moving. And I really can't recall clearly how we did it. So in addition to having new his legal work during the day, he has to work supporting the war effort at night. So he's working at this place called consolidated aircraft that is making airplanes for the war effort. And really what I was thinking about this whole section that a little adversity goes a long way. This is the start of Seoul's unbelievably strong work ethic. He really starts to get fulfillment from working hard and being productive. And we see him contrast his own work ethic with his father's again. Throughout the rest of the war, Seoul was at his law office eight in the morning until noon. Then he worked. He had to drive across town to consolidated the aircraft company until 11 15 at night. So his workdays from eight in the morning to 11 15 at night. He would eat dinner, go to sleep, and then the next morning do it all over again. Seoul did not complain and said I actually enjoyed the experience. Unlike his father who had managed to find ways not to work, Seoul thrived when he was busy working hard and feeling productive. This is what I mean about a little adversity going a long way. It's actually good for you. His desire to work hard and get the most out of every hour of the day was not characteristic of his earlier years. So commented that he never worked very hard in school, at least not until law school beginning with his early career in law and his work at consolidated. ([Time 0:17:26](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ce2ed3a5-ebad-4063-92d5-703c229d9727))
    - **Note:** A little adversity goes a long way. Sol at 25 had to join the war effort working as a lawyer from 8-12 then in the factory until 11 pm this work ethic changed his life and set him on a different path. As a young lawyer he realized that doing pro bono work for Jewish charities helped grow his customer base even if it hurt in the short term. He optimized his time there is so much time we waste. Do it now. Realized he didn’t like the law but didn’t start his first company until 40. Business people didn’t need to be the smartest.
- The Successful but Flawed Businessman: The Story of Isadore Teacher
  Summary:
  Isadore Teacher, a successful real estate investor and businessman, showed that formal education is not a prerequisite for business success but highlighted the importance of being smart in various aspects of life.
  Despite his professional success, Teacher struggled in his marriages, as evidenced by a divorce that almost led to the loss of his assets. He displayed exceptional courage and resilience in the face of challenges, as seen in his response when his assets were threatened during the divorce proceedings.
  This bold attitude left a lasting impression on those around him, influencing their negotiation tactics and business approach.
  Through Teacher's experiences, we witness the early stages of what would eventually become Costco, a significant driver of the San Diego economy.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  He was one of Seoul's clients. He had emigrated to the United States from Scotland when he was three years old. And he had no formal education, but he was very smart. And then Seoul also saw that, okay, you don't have to have formal education be smart in business, but you can be smart in business and bad in other aspects of your life. Seoul is very akin to like Ed Thorpe where he was able to be unbelievably professionally successful, not and without really messing up other parts of his life. Isadore teacher had a problem picking wives? And he also said some funny stuff here. So it says, teacher was very successful real estate investor and business person. He wasn't very successful, however, when it came to his marriages. Seoul represented teacher in a divorce that ended up in the court. And so his wife's divorce attorney was threatening to have the court take all take over all of teachers assets. Seoul went back to teacher and told him about the threat. Teacher's response to something that Seoul said he'd always remembered. And this is what teacher said. Well, that's okay if my wife wants to sink the ship, let her sink the ship. I can swim better than she can. Teacher's gutsy response made a big impression on Seoul because over the years, Seoul was never afraid to hang tough in a negotiation. And so it's through Seoul's legal practice that we see the very first like kernel of this idea that's going to eventually turn into Costco. And so a major driver of the San Diego economy at this point in history was the Navy. ([Time 0:20:17](https://share.snipd.com/snip/eb9b5e6e-a98d-41c5-97f8-a69ae18a6308))
    - **Note:** Sol learned a lot from his legal customers who were often successful businessmen with great confidence in their abilities. He constantly went to work. Sol business practices started by understanding locker clubs which catered to a niche regulation to create a great business constantly learning. You understand only looking backwards. He sees so many ideas that he utilizes later. He saw people were driving 2 hours to save money at fed co clear product market fit. Many entrepreneurs have lucky early breaks in not selling but had they known how hard it’d be many wouldn’t have done it.
- The Founder and Innovations of EJ Corvette: A Pioneer of Discount Retailing
  Summary:
  The founder of EJ Corvette introduced a new type of discount retailing by opening the first discount store in 1948.
  He revolutionized the concept of a discount department store by selling products at deep discounts from the suggested fair trade prices, challenging the existing laws. By requiring shoppers to become members, he found a loophole to circumvent fair trade laws, a strategy that predates the membership-based model of companies like Costco by 40 years.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So we're just going to say he's the founder of EJ Corvette. There's a new type of retailing. Discounting was launched by this guy named Eugene who founded this company called EJ Corvette. He opened the first discount store in 1948. And this founder did much to define the idea of a discount department store. What he would do is he would sell products at deep discounts from the manufactured suggested fair trade prices. This is very important at this time. And Seoul was one of the people that gets these ridiculous, ridiculous laws overturned. There was these things called fair trade prices that said you had to charge the customer, even if you could sell it cheaper, because you had a better cost structure because you're more Efficient, did not matter. There was these artificial like floors on prices that Seoul thought was ridiculous. And so the founder of EJ Corvette figured out a way like a loophole to get around these fair trade prices. The way Corvette circumvented the fair trade laws was by requiring that shoppers become members in order to shop. The membership was really just a way of outsmarting the fair trade laws. This is incredible. I love how these like little weird decisions that happen. Think about this happen 1948. That is 40 years before Costco is invented or founded rather. But this idea this like this obviously that the one of the benefits are the being benefit of Costco is like almost all their profit comes from the the the reoccurring membership right. ([Time 0:27:21](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9793439b-9c45-400d-bb27-32f4defba26d))
    - **Note:** There were fair trade laws that set price floors and sol saw someone use a membership structure to get around it which planted the seeds of Costco. Costco business model created by this regulation randomly. Cross disciplinary giving people great deals. Focused on capping the downside signs a 10 year lease with the option to cancel after 1 year. His customers were happy but competition hated him. He was a ruthless competitor who aligned incentives completely as the take was just the membership.
- Fed Mart's Wage Philosophy and the Costco Hiring Frenzy
  Summary:
  By setting a uniform wage rate of a dollar per hour for all employees across different locations, Fed Mart's owner ensured fairness and simplicity in the wage structure.
  This decision attracted a large number of job seekers and led to excellent profits in stores like San Diego and Phoenix. The owner's commitment to doing the right thing also extended to rejecting segregation practices, emphasizing the importance of fairness and equality in the workplace.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And he said that Costco had 22,000 people apply for 200 open positions. I think that was when they were opening a new store. At this point, Fed Mart's expanding there into San Diego, our assuming San Antonio, which is a cheaper cost of living than where the other Fed Mart stores are, but soul price thought It was unethical to pay them less than he was paying other Fed Mart employees. Employers were paying their employees 50 cents per hour. He decided that the wage should be a dollar per hour. And so it's the result. Of course, everyone wanted to work at Fed Mart. That's the same idea that Costco has 22,000 people apply for 200 positions. Why would he require Fed Mart's wages to be twice as much as competitors? Fed Mart was paying a dollar an hour to employees in San Diego and Phoenix. The wage decision in San Antonio was simple. Employees in San Antonio worked just as hard as the other Fed Mart employees. Fed Mart had excellent profits in San Diego and Phoenix while paying good wages. Why just not apply the same wage philosophy in San Antonio? And what I wrote here is just keep it simple. I've seen other companies like compensation structure and it's like you need like a PhD in math to figure it out. Just keep it simple. Oh, we pay them a dollar an hour in San Diego. Okay, we're opening the store. Dollar an hour there. Less time to think about it, move on to actually things that are more important. And one thing that you have to love about Sol that he always felt that he had to do the right thing no matter what. And so at this point, there's still a lot of segregation in the United States. And he's just not with that. He's like, there's no way that I'm putting these provisions in any lease. ([Time 0:33:33](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c5f986f3-6840-4434-a23d-651d5381b8fe))
    - **Note:** Sol always did the right thing paying above market wages and standardizakng wages. He paid 2x in San Antonio what the competition paid but wanted compensation to be flat. Incentive alignment doing the right thing. Sol always went for long term better for the customer over short term profits. Human nature never changes. They got so much hate and fought through it bricks thrown through windows. The Kirkland white label brand come about to get around fair trade laws. He got sued for selling too cheaply.
- The Battle Over Fair Trade Laws and Low Prices
  Key takeaways:
  - Low price merchandise with limited selection can result in intelligent loss of sales.
  - Soul played a role in overturning fair trade laws in 1975 by creating consumer demand for lower prices.
  - Only liquor remains subject to minimum price maintenance in some states.
  - Soul was sued for violating state liquor price maintenance regulation by pricing the liquor at a 12% markup.
  - FedMart's attorneys argued in court that federal law preempted state law in the case.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  One of the most important factors is that soul, soul price believed low price merchandise with limited selection. So it caused that an intelligent loss of sales, which I'll get his idea of intelligent loss of sales, which I'll get to in a minute. But I wanted to bring up this part. This is what I mentioned that he was he helped get these ridiculous laws overturned. Because again, at the end of the day, it's just better for customers. It's all we really need to focus on by 1975, consumer demand for lower prices convinced Congress that it was time to repeal fair trade laws. Only liquor remains subject to minimum price maintenance in some states. So what does soul do soul told the FedMart liquor buyer to purchase national brand liquor and to price the liquor at a 12% markup. The state of California challenged FedMart's pricing as a violation of the state's liquor price maintenance regulation. Think about that. Soul is getting being just like Mrs. B. Soul is getting sued for selling too cheaply. FedMart's attorneys argued in court that federal law preempted state law. The judge sided with FedMart. So remember at the very beginning of the book, Jim was saying, Hey, there's this guy, positive effect, thousands of people's lives. And part of it is because he viewed himself as a teacher. And so at the beginning of this chapter, there's a fantastic quote by Jim Cinegal. And he says, If you're not spending 90% of your time teaching, you're not doing your job. And that's something he learned from soul. Jim Cinegal Costco's founder started working for soul in 1954 at the age of 18. ([Time 0:37:52](https://share.snipd.com/snip/df550e1f-e6e1-4cce-9229-c4180f6f8746))
    - **Note:** Sol was a teacher. Spent 90% of his time teaching. Sol wanted everyone to understand why and Jim sinegal learned everything from sol. Sol used the intelligent loss of sales believing people cared more about low prices than selection he was right. The cost to deal with fewer items scales and this is your greatest cost. Sol wasn’t a great operator but was a visionary. He continued to learn from competition but sold to an asshole who he overlooked the flaws of because he loved the deal. You can’t make a good deal with a bad person. He ends up getting fired very early by this man.
- The Origin Story of Costco and Its Wholesale Business Model
  Summary:
  Costco's origin story involves the idea of a wholesale business model, with a no-frills warehouse environment offering a wide range of products at very low prices.
  The business model was based on membership-based warehouse selling to independent business owners, where they could pool their buying power. The key to success was the limited selection of items, high operating efficiencies, and direct delivery from suppliers, enabling lower prices than competitors.
  For a membership fee, business owners could access discounted products by leveraging collective buying power at the warehouse.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  They sold products to small businesses in a no frills warehouse environment. Its strategy was to offer a wide range of business products at very low prices. Soul thought just maybe there's a way to have a wholesale business selling to independent business owners. So he's going to have a membership based warehouse business. It's going to have no frills and it's going to sell business products at low prices to business owners. And if you think about the price club idea, Costco is this, but for everybody, the price club idea was finally conceived a wholesale business selling merchandise to small independent Businesses. The business owners would come to a large warehouse, select the products from a steel rack displays and pay either by check or cash. Thousands of small businesses would pool their buying power for shopping at our whole sale warehouse. Now there's millions, I don't know, tens of millions, I don't even know how many Costco members are. Let's say 100 million. In this case, there was thousands of small businesses pulling their buying power together. In Costco's case, there's a hundred million or whatever, 50 million customers pulling their buying power together. That is a very, very powerful idea. And this may be the main idea of the book. Everything that made price club different is what made price club successful. Price club differed from its competitors because of the number of items offered for sale. The typical grocery or discount store carried about 50,000 different items compared to price clubs, 3000 items. Price club was a warehouse with rack storage, high ceilings and concrete floors. And most importantly, the prices for the merchandise were far less than prices available anywhere else. The operating efficiencies of the warehouse concept and the direct delivery of products from the suppliers to price club made it possible to sell merchandise for less. And so the value proposition to the business owner is real simple. For $25 membership fee a year, you have your, we can pull together the buying power of thousands of you, eventually tens of thousands of you, and then you have your own warehouse. We will handle the buying and the delivery logistics. You just have to drive to your warehouse that you're a member of and pick it up. ([Time 0:48:40](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7e619173-4675-42dd-b15a-cceace4ca95d))
    - **Note:** Everything that made price club different is what made it successful. Differentiation is survival. Jim refused to raise the price of a hot dog. Values first threatened to kill thr person who suggested it. Know your values. Sol price gave birth to literally every discount retailer. Sol taught too much instead of hiding his secret this allowed better operators to be more successful don’t let good ideas out. Sol lost focus and didn’t keep marching forward ruthlessly like Walmart and Costco. Geberal Patton never hold ground move forward.
- Lessons from My Father: Life Skills and Legacy
  Key takeaways:
  - The impact someone can have on the lives of others can be a significant legacy
  - Learning from and being grateful for the transformative impact of a parent is important
  - Lessons on business, thinking, humility, appreciation, care, hope, and helping others can be learned from a parent
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And so as with every biography, you just can't help but put your yourself in their shoes. And imagine living a life and succeeding life like this where long after you're gone, this is what your son or your daughter, the way they honored you, that's more impressive than any of the wealth he built. As much as Soul's public accomplishments represent a tremendous legacy, his more enduring legacy may be on the impact that he had on the lives of the many people who knew him. All of us can honestly say that there's at least one person who has had a transformative impact on the course of our lives. For me, that person was my father. Whatever I have learned about business I learned from my father, everything. He taught me how to think and had a question and how to fall into the trap of assuming rather than checking things out for myself. He also taught me to be humble, to appreciate the unpredictability of life, to care for people, to remain hopeful, and always to be there for people who are in need. Working alongside my father for nearly 45 years, I came to appreciate how unique our relationship was. My father was a strong man who told me that he had to be tough to grow up and survive. He was very smart, opinionated, and could make his case with anyone. I had grown up arguing with my father. Our business relationship was not any different. He often said to me that I could drive him nuts. My natural tendency was to frequently take the opposite side of an argument just because I knew nobody else would. As he and I aged, we had fewer of those arguments. My father was so competent, so responsible and protective, that as he withdrew from day-to-day activities, I wondered whether I could ever carry on without him. The truth is that my father and I were very different people, but the greatest tribute I can give him is that he taught me so much, sometimes without my even realizing that a lesson was taking place. When it was time for me to step up, I was ready. What greater legacy could there be from a father to a son than leaving the gift of life skills necessary to carry on? The father was born in a small Russian village. His son was a poster child for the American dream. His immigrant parents were born in a small Russian village. He was raised in the Bronx and was the first of his family to graduate from college. He earned a law degree. He became an exceptionally successful businessman and philanthropist. He celebrated 70 years of marriage to his beloved wife Helen. He was a good father who instilled high values in his sons, and he never walked away from responsibility. It doesn't get much better than that. And that is where I'll leave it. For the full story, I highly recommend buying the book.
