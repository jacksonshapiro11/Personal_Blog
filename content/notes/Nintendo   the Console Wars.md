### Highlights

- The Game and Watch, a highly successful but less-known Nintendo product line
  Summary:
  The Game and Watch actually sold a ton of units. I think 43 million units got sold before it ended life. It was huge in Asia though. Like you said, 43 million units, over a billion dollars in lifetime revenue from this product line. And Gunpei's technology philosophy is lateral thinking with withered technology. Because the NES still was cutting edge hardware in many ways.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  And the Game and Watch actually sold a ton of units. I think 43 million units got sold before it ended life.
  Speaker 1
  Yes. I think Western audiences don't know that much about it because it was never that popular in the West. It was huge in Asia though. Like you said, 43 million units, over a billion dollars in lifetime revenue from this product line, which back then in the 80s and kind of pre NES, that was super, super significant for Nintendo. Now, if you're thinking about this, given everything we talked about last time about technological and video game innovation and marvels that Donkey Kong and Mario were and the NES and how advanced it was, how the hell did Gunpei and Nintendo get Donkey Kong running on a portable piece of hardware in 1982? For NES?
  Speaker 3
  How did this come about?
  Speaker 1
  It would be through Gunpei's philosophy, which really becomes sort of the second core piece of Nintendo philosophy beyond the name of the game as the game. And Gunpei's technology philosophy is lateral thinking with withered technology.
  Speaker 2
  Because the NES still was cutting edge hardware in many ways.
  Speaker 1
  Absolutely. It was years ahead of the competition. It had the first GPU architecture and a consumer focused device. It was not withered technology. ([Time 0:04:48](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c61ca7c7-063b-4345-af78-46afb15a5609))
    - **Note:** Lateral thinking with withered technology
- The Origins of Game and Watch and On-the-Go Entertainment
  Key takeaways:
  - LCD screens use a simple processor for basic operations, similar to a calculator
  - Donkey Kong port may not be arcade quality, but people can now play on the go
  - Game and Watch idea came from observing a businessman using a calculator on a train
  - Observes potential demand for on-the-go video entertainment in the 1980s
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  And you know, with the LCD screens, basically the same type of screen, it's no more advanced of a processor doing simple math to decide whether the character moves left or right and summing points and things like that. It's a calculator.
  Speaker 1
  Nobody would mistake this for an arcade quality port of Donkey Kong, but it doesn't matter. People now can play Donkey Kong on the go. This is amazing. People love it. Huge deal. But that the way Gunpei came up with the idea for doing the Game and Watch in the first place was he was on the train in Tokyo and he observed a businessman who was also on the train who was just killing time by pressing buttons on his calculator and doing random things on his like business calculator. And I think that tells you a ton about the potential demand for on the go video entertainment in the 1980s. ([Time 0:07:23](https://share.snipd.com/snip/bf38129b-cc99-4b7a-a69a-7c0cf17a8a1d))
    - **Note:** Finding product market fit. Seeing technology and adjusting to its use.
- The Visionary God-Yamuchi: The Story Behind Game Boy
  Key takeaways:
  - Yamuchi was a visionary and understood technology better than anyone else at Nintendo
  - Despite initial doubts, Yamuchi gave the go-ahead for the Game Boy project
  - Internal nickname for the project was 'Domigame' or 'Dame game', which means hopeless game
  - Game Boy was released in Japan in April 1989 and in the US for $89.95 shortly after
  - The Game Boy revolutionized the video game market and is still celebrated as an iconic device of the 80s and 90s tech industry
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So God bless Yamuchi. That man was a visionary and he completely got it. And for a non technologist, he understood technology better than anybody because he gives Gunpei the go ahead on this. Everybody else at Nintendo is like, This is not going to work. I know we're still in the 1980s here, but the 1980s are more advanced than you might think. Like black and white is like the 1960s. Nobody wants black and white, especially in the video game market. Which is supposed to be this advanced technology graphical market.
  Speaker 2
  And to play games that they're accustomed to seeing in color, you're going to go downgrade Mario.
  Speaker 1
  Like that's a terrible experience. Right. Terrible, terrible idea. So internally, this project gets the nickname. I'm not exactly sure how to pronounce this, but it's either Domigame or Dame game, D-A-M-E-G-A-M-E, which basically means hopeless game. And nevertheless, they push ahead. And in April, 1989, they released this device in Japan, followed shortly in the US for $89.95. And this device, of course, is named the Game Boy. We talk about this all the time on acquired things that are in technology and our industry in the past that just seem so natural. We don't even think about them. Why did they call it the Game Boy? They called it the Game Boy to dig it Sony, who if they've made it, would have called it the Game Man. Why?
  Speaker 5
  Because they had the Walk Man. Oh, no way.
  Speaker 2
  That's really why. ([Time 0:10:13](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8642fcad-eb48-475e-bd5a-675c87df78ef))
    - **Note:** Made the gameboy by combining the NES and game and watch. They had to release it in black and white because the tech wasn’t there but it was so revolutionary that it still took off
- The Universal Appeal of Game Boy: From a Businessman Status Symbol to a Family Nostalgia
  Key takeaways:
  - 46% of Game Boy players in the US are adults
  - Game Boy became a businessman status symbol
  - Nintendo sold 32 million Game Boys in the first three years
  - Game Boy and Game Boy Color sold 118 million units in total
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  In the US, 46% of Game Boy players are adults. This is so different from the NES market. It becomes this businessman status symbol. And like I remember this in my own life. Like everything in these Nintendo ads actually happened in my family. Like my dad used to steal my Game Boy all the time.
  Speaker 2
  We had to go get him his own. Did you have one of the original fat ones? Oh, totally.
  Speaker 1
  I was five years old when it came out. So I was exactly in the target kid demographic. And I think my dad, I was talking with him about this this weekend. He still plays the original Tetris cartridge on like an old Game Boy advance at this point to this day. This is how universal the appeal of this game in this system is. It's unbelievable. So Nintendo ends up selling 32 million Game Boys in the first three years, which is way more than the NES. It's roughly $3 billion in hardware sales alone. The Game Boy and then it's sort of quasi successor, but really the same platform, the Game Boy Color, they would go on to sell 118 million units worldwide, which is over double the NES and the fourth highest selling console of all time period. Wow, just amazing. And this was Nintendo's first taste and really the whole industry's first taste of massively expanding what already was a huge gaming market. Yeah. ([Time 0:15:42](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3e86d139-0b2e-43ef-9b1c-4d5b25d0a6fd))
    - **Note:** They were able to market and sell the game Oy to kids and adults. Great ad campaign targeted at business travelers.
- The Console Wars: Genesis' Struggle in America
  Key takeaways:
  - The Genesis initially did not sell well in the US, only selling about 500,000 units in the first year
  - Nintendo did not view Genesis as a competitive threat and did not release their next generation system ASAP
  - Sega installed a new CEO named Tom Kalinsky to turn around their ailing video game console business
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Exactly. Well, we will get to that. So it doesn't have Sonic in the US either. So even if you think you know the history of the console wars and the Genesis in America or you lived it as I did, I didn't remember this exactly as it happened. So initially the Genesis is also a flop in America. It sells about 500,000 units in the first year, which you know, like again is okay, but this isn't that much better than the old master system here.
  Speaker 2
  And Nintendo isn't necessarily viewing it as the competitive threat that says, okay, we need to release our next generation system ASAP. They're like, okay, cool. This one also isn't beating us. So I guess let's keep riding the sales of the NES. Right.
  Speaker 1
  Why would we change things? So the next year in 1990, Sega decides like, hey, we need to make a change here. And specifically we need to make a change in Sega of America. So they install a new CEO, a guy named Tom Kalinsky. Now if you're looking for an executive to come in and turn around your ailing video game console business to do things differently, you probably wouldn't go hire Tom. Tom at this point is a toy executive. He's in his late 40s. ([Time 0:28:55](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7a963433-d6d5-434b-97a2-dd00cf39f105))
    - **Note:** Game companies were seen as toys sega hired the head of mitel to run their gaming business
- Competing Against an Entrenched Incumbent: The Four Point Plan
  Key takeaways:
  - The four point plan discussed in the podcast is a brilliant way to compete against an entrenched incumbent.
  - The plan involves preemptively starting a price war.
  - Nintendo likes to make money on their hardware and this is used against them.
  - Genesis will counter position by not making money on hardware.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Oh, totally. We're going to get into what they do this four point plan, but it is freaking brilliant. I think this is the best example we've ever seen on the show of how to compete against an entrenched incumbent. Yeah, they literally walk up to Nintendo and just punch them in the mouth. It's so great. So here's the plan. Point one, we need to preemptively start a price war. So we know that Nintendo is working on a new 16 bit system. They're just dragging their feet because they feel no sense of urgency here. We also know, given Nintendo's history, everything we talked about in part one, that they like to make money on their hardware. They want high hardware margins. So here's what we're going to do. We think they're probably going to price the super Nintendo when it comes out at the equivalent of $250. We're selling the Genesis for 200 right now. We're going to preemptively cut that to $150.
  Speaker 2
  And this is perfect counter positioning. Nintendo's incumbent strategy is to make money on hardware. What are we going to do? We're not going to make money on hardware. Exactly.
  Speaker 1
  So we're going to preemptively put pressure on them to cut costs on the super Nintendo. I don't think Tom and Seika even realized how important this would become. Put a pin in this. We're going to come back to this in one sec. This is a critical move, especially the preemptive. ([Time 0:32:38](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a595d6ad-38d1-4011-9383-e1c69ba428df))
    - **Note:** Sega starts out by positioning lower for the 16 bit games and cuts cost lower than they even thought took Nintendo out at the legs. They also partnered their best game with the console natively as well to gain share in the US market even if they lost money and created a us centered studio.
- Lessons from Nintendo and Nike on the Importance of Being Aggressive
  Key takeaways:
  - Nintendo lost their advantage by playing defense and not being aggressive
  - Sega was able to take advantage of Nintendo's defensive strategy
  - Playing offense is important to winning
  - Nike's corporate values emphasize playing offense all the time
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  It's funny. Strength leads to strength. If Nintendo had just been aggressive and obsolete themselves, they would have probably been in a great position, but instead they sat back. They sort of tried to play defense. They tried to give enough running room to their NES to keep making good money as long as possible. Then it left this opening for Sega to come in and pull this move and then suddenly Nintendo no longer has an advantage to leverage. It's like the classic football prevent defense thing will prevent defense prevents you from winning. You got to keep being aggressive and playing offense.
  Speaker 1
  It reminds me of I think my favorite company values sheet of all time, which is the legendary Nike corporate values. So good. Number two is we're on offense all the time. Yes. Yeah. You don't win by playing the prevent defense. Nope.
  Speaker 2
  Absolutely not. ([Time 0:40:41](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ec9c096f-1c4f-46c4-98f9-b1e5f31135f9))
    - **Note:** To move forward you need to disrupt yourself you can win with prevent defense
- The Successful Brand of Sonic in the 1990s and its Competitivity Against Nintendo
  Key takeaways:
  - Sonic was originally designed with fangs and a scantily clad human girlfriend
  - Sonic was aggressive and became a means of competing against Nintendo
  - Sonic became more recognizable than Mario in the 1993 queue survey
  - Sonic's success was due in part to being bundled in with every Genesis console
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  That originally had fangs and an electric guitar. That's right.
  Speaker 1
  Also, like a human girlfriend that was not wearing much clothing, I think originally. Yes. Scantilly clad human girlfriend. Yes. And the best and the worst of the 1990s, but mostly, especially with the final version of Sonic, just freaking awesome. It doesn't get any better than that.
  Speaker 2
  So Mario is family friendly and kind of slow and open to exploration. And Sonic is not only fast, but aggressive. The whole brand of Sega kind of adopted the brand of Sonic on its means of competing against Nintendo. Totally.
  Speaker 1
  So remember how we talked about in the, I think it was maybe the 1990 queue survey that Mario was more recognizable than Mickey Mouse? Well, by the 1993 queue survey, Mario is still more recognizable than Mickey Mouse. But Sonic is even more recognizable than Mario by American consumers, which is like, wow, just ridiculous. A couple of years later, like that is how successful Sonic was. And this was part of Kalinsky's genius. It was bundled in with every Genesis console. So Sega is giving up on the incremental $50, $60 pop revenue that they could get from Sonic the Hedgehog. ([Time 0:43:48](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1252b6d4-51a1-40eb-88f3-fcc176b4452c))
    - **Note:** Sonic was perfectly counter positioned against Mario. They also made Nintendo sacrifice backwards compatibility because it was too expensive to include and destroyed the network effect.
- The Marketing Genius Behind Sega's Rise and Sony's PlayStation Launch
  Key takeaways:
  - Steve Race masterminded rebox resurgence against Nike in the 80s with the pump sneakers
  - Kielinski tells him to just go wild on the marketing
  - Steve would pretty much single-handedly yank Sega and really the whole video game industry
  - This sets the stage for the PlayStation out of the toy world and into full-on media technology
  - The Welcome to the Next Level campaign was created by the Goodby Silverstein ad agency and had a trademark way that all of the ad spots ended with the Sega screen
  - There's also some pretty amazing jujitsu here around the idea that you've graduated from Nintendo.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So point four, punching Nintendo in the mouth. Kielinski goes out and brings on a guy named Steve Race who had masterminded rebox resurgence against Nike in the 80s with the pump sneakers. Remember that? Oh, yeah. That was Steve Race's brainchild. And Kielinski tells him to just go wild on the marketing. Steve would go on to leave Sega and become the first president of Sony Computer Entertainment America for the launch of the PlayStation. But before that, he would pretty much single-handedly yank Sega and really the whole video game industry. I mean, this really sets the stage for the PlayStation out of the toy world and into full-on media technology, the MTV generation. This is Sega and his work. So they go out, they hire the Goodby Silverstein ad agency and they come up with the Welcome to the Next Level campaign, which was just so great and had the trademark way that all of the ad spots ended with the Sega screen.
  Speaker 2
  So there's also some pretty amazing jujitsu here around the idea that you've graduated from Nintendo. ([Time 0:50:57](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3a486113-c7fb-4724-bcb5-0a1741b7a959))
    - **Note:** Sega was fighting with EA but instead of suing they partnered and grew the pie. Positive sun thinking.
- The downfall of Sega and their exit from the hardware business
  Key takeaways:
  - Sega of America and the parent company massively disagreed on launching Sega Saturn
  - This mismanagement caused a total disaster and started the downfall of Sega
  - Sega failed with the Saturn, followed by the Dreamcast
  - Sega exited the hardware business, went bankrupt, and got acquired by Sammy
  - Nintendo now has the virtual console on the Switch to play Genesis games
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, it's a long and sad story, but basically, Kalinsky and Sega of America and the parent company and the board back in Japan massively disagree on how and when to launch the Sega Saturn, the next 32-bit console generation, that conflict and that mismanagement becomes a total disaster and it starts a downward spiral for Sega with the failure of the Saturn and then they follow it up really quickly with the Dreamcast. That also never really gets traction. Dreamcast was actually an awesome console and very innovative on a lot of fronts, but they just start bleeding cash. They end up exiting the hardware business and the company basically goes bankrupt and has to get acquired by a pachinko manufacturer called Sammy.
  Speaker 3
  It's really sad. Brutal.
  Speaker 2
  They now make games for Nintendo platforms.
  Speaker 1
  Well, and the great outcome of that is that you can play Genesis games on the virtual console on the Switch, so good for consumers.
  Speaker 2
  The story feels abrupt, but I remember it feeling abrupt when it happens too.
  Speaker 1
  Yep, a story for another day, but for our purposes here in the Nintendo story, the point is that Nintendo has now fallen and they've fallen pretty hard. There were a couple other self-inflicted Nintendo wounds around this time too. Starting in 1988, they actually get embroiled in two separate antitrust lawsuits with each of the successor Atari entities, both the hardware side and the game side. ([Time 1:00:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/893bb754-6332-44c7-9dbc-d9183e002df6))
    - **Note:** Nintendo started competing with sega and while Nintendo didn’t get crushed they lost their pedestal of being the dominant player over all others start of the downfall.
- Nintendo's N64 and the Rise of First Party Titles
  Key takeaways:
  - The N64 was great for playing Nintendo's first-party games.
  - Many of the most popular N64 titles were first-party games.
  - The only popular N64 non-first-party game was GoldenEye.
  - GoldenEye was developed by Rare, which had a close relationship with Nintendo.
  - The PlayStation 2 became the best selling console of all time, surpassing the N64 and all other consoles.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  And the N64 ended up being a fantastic console to play Nintendo first party games on. Yes. And even more than ever before entrenched that that is what our company is all about. I mean, Super Mario 64, Mario Kart 64, Super Smash Brothers, Star Fox, GoldenEye. I mean, these are all first party titles. The only one that wasn't is GoldenEye. And that was rare, which was a very close relationship with Nintendo. Yep.
  Speaker 1
  That was a second party title. Nintendo owned at that point in time something like 25, 30% of rare and rare developed exclusively for Nintendo platforms. So that's the N64 PlayStation. And then in the next generation, the wheels just totally come off the bus. Sony and the PlayStation 2 goes on to become the best selling console of all time.
  Speaker 2
  Still to this day, the PS2 has sold more units than any other console, including the Game Boy, including the Nintendo Switch. ([Time 1:15:22](https://share.snipd.com/snip/484fb1de-a72c-4c0c-b0e7-96d925538721))
    - **Note:** Nintendo creates a comedy of errors they make an enemy out of Sony and push back on 3rd party development and Sony eats their lunch. The ps2 becomes the most widely sold console ever and they capture the 3rd party devs.
- The GameCube: Nintendo's Awkward Teenager in a Market of Grown-Ups
  Key takeaways:
  - Nintendo GameCube struggled with its target audience
  - GameCube's specs were competitive, but it looked like a lunchbox
  - PS2 was a tough competitor with sleek design and advanced features
  - Microsoft's entry added to Gamecube's challenges
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I actually have like a really fond memories of the GameCube, but this was just the epitome of Nintendo was like a kid that was really cool in middle school and then got awkward in puberty and in high school, gets stuffed in a locker. They had no idea who it was for.
  Speaker 2
  They made it and it was more competitive on a specs perspective than the PS1 and they did try to market it like it was for everyone, like it was a game system for kids, for adults.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, except it looked like a lunchbox. Totally.
  Speaker 2
  And it also was competing against the supercomputer PS2.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, literally people are worried about this thing guiding nuclear missiles. Like what do you think the American teenager is going to want to buy? The thing that their parents are freaking out about nuclear war or a thing that looks like their little brother's lunchbox.
  Speaker 2
  And the PS2, you know, it's black and it's sleek and it's the same playbook that the Sega Genesis ran in terms of we're like the grown up gaming machine. On top of all of this.
  Speaker 1
  Microsoft enters the market. Yes.
  Speaker 2
  Another company. So suddenly you have a two horse race, both of which have infinite treasuries and are subsidizing this market they really want to get into.
  Speaker 4
  And neither of the two horses is Nintendo.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah. So Microsoft with the Xbox, Microsoft takes at least a five billion dollar ([Time 1:18:33](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6aba6b46-239f-410f-9847-a4890d30cf00))
    - **Note:** Nintendo gets killed by Sony and Microsoft who subsidize the hell out of their systems. Nintendo lost the plot.
- Nintendo's Monopoly on Handheld Gaming: The GameBoy and its Successors
  Key takeaways:
  - Nintendo's GameBoy and its successors saved the company for 20 years
  - Nintendo had a monopoly on portable gaming for years
  - GameBoy is the fourth best-selling console of all time, with DS and Switch at second and third place, and GameBoy Advance following
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Before doing the research for this part too, like I didn't realize the GameBoy and its successors saved Nintendo's skin for like 20 years.
  Speaker 2
  So that's GameBoy, which includes the GameBoy Pocket, it's GameBoy Color, it's GameBoy Advance, and then of course they would launch the DS, which we'll chat about in a minute here. But it is amazing that Nintendo basically had a monopoly on portable gaming. This entire time there's the home console wars they're playing out and there's this whole side thing that's happening where Nintendo is selling millions of units as the only credible player in handheld.
  Speaker 1
  Literally everybody's wringing all their hands about the home console business and that's all that anybody who's serious pays attention to.
  Speaker 3
  But over in the handheld market, Nintendo is just continuing to crush it like it's like 1989 here.
  Speaker 1
  So remember how we said all the way back in the beginning of the episode that the GameBoy is the fourth best selling console of all time. And then we just said that PlayStation 2 is the first best selling console of all time. Numbers two and three are the DS and the Switch. And then the GameBoy Advance isn't far behind. So everything, and we're going to talk about the Switch at the end of the episode obviously, but everything that Nintendo gets wrong in the home console market, they get right in the handheld market.
  Speaker 2
  We could have retitled this episode as Nintendo, the handheld gaming company, and that wouldn't have been far from the truth. ([Time 1:22:18](https://share.snipd.com/snip/78dd6b6d-8505-47a5-8056-00867814b689))
    - **Note:** What kept them alive was the dominance in the handheld market.
- The Dominance of Nintendo in the Handheld Gaming Market
  Key takeaways:
  - Nintendo is a global monopoly in handheld gaming
  - The PSP was for a different market and never competed head to head with GameBoy
  - Nintendo had innovative technology and a dominant third party developer platform
  - Nintendo had perfect backwards compatibility in consumer software libraries
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  We could have retitled this episode as Nintendo, the handheld gaming company, and that wouldn't have been far from the truth.
  Speaker 1
  That is 100% the truth. So let's go down the checklist. Global monopoly. Yes. Sony does launch the PlayStation Portable. I had one.
  Speaker 3
  Oh, you have one. Oh, that's awesome.
  Speaker 2
  I never had one. Got stolen out of my locker in high school. Oh, no. Oh, brutal.
  Speaker 3
  Oh, brutal.
  Speaker 1
  Which is a great device, but it was for a different market segment than the GameBoy. It never competed head to head with GameBoy. It had a really fancy screen, so it was pretty good for watching movies.
  Speaker 2
  It was more like a small computer. It was kind of like an iPad, as probably the precursor to an iPad type device. Totally.
  Speaker 1
  Very Sony device. Yes.
  Speaker 2
  All the way to the proprietary memory sticks. Very Sony.
  Speaker 1
  Yes. So global monopoly. Check. Most innovative technology.
  Speaker 3
  Ironically, also check.
  Speaker 1
  Thanks to Gunpei Yukoi's Maxim of Lateral Thinking with Witherd Technology. A huge and dominant third party developer platform.
  Speaker 3
  Check.
  Speaker 1
  Locked in consumer software libraries with perfect backwards compatibility. Check. Literally everything that they got wrong in the home business. They get right in the handheld business. So the GameBoy and GameBoy Color sell 118 million units over a 12 year run. ([Time 1:23:37](https://share.snipd.com/snip/02a41ec3-3341-4efa-ba4a-76a8d36e2fff))
    - **Note:** Everything they got wrong in in home they got right in hand held.
- The Appeal of Game Boy for Kids and Parents
  Key takeaways:
  - The Game Boy became popular for kids as Sony and Microsoft moved into mature gaming
  - The Game Boy is cheaper, less immersive, and offers a guaranteed seal of quality brand
  - The Game Boy is a compelling choice for parents of kids due to lack of adult content games
  - Pokemon is a great example of the popularity of Game Boy among kids
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  This is the bread and butter all the way back to the NES and the toy aisle as Sony and Microsoft moved into the Grand Theft Auto era and the Call of Duty era and the Halo era. Right. Core gamers. More mature content, the Game Boy became the new home for kids. It's cheaper. Hey, so like if you're a parent of a four or a five year old, you're not going to worry about buying a hundred dollar piece of plastic for them. It's less immersive, which is actually a feature for kids because it's easier to play. And then back to the Nintendo kind of guarantee seal of quality brand, you can be pretty sure that Little Susie and Little Jimmy isn't going to be playing really violent or adult content games on your Game Boy Advance or DS or what have you. So it's really compelling for little kids and their parents. And as we talked about a few minutes ago, nothing embodies this more than Pokemon. We talked about Pokemon on the NFL episode where Pokemon is, I think in my opinion, wrongly listed as the highest grossing media franchise of all time because the NFL really should be a single media franchise and is bigger, but it doesn't matter. Pokemon is number two or number one, no matter how you want to say it. Lifetime Pokemon franchise revenues are just under a hundred billion dollars. And the primary medium for it is the freaking Game Boy. Yeah. ([Time 1:30:35](https://share.snipd.com/snip/cc6d92b8-6dab-450f-8239-e45cb707c038))
    - **Note:** Nintendo became a hand held winner with no competition and found product market fit. Pokémon became their juggernaut in the space. AAA game.
- The Origins of Pokémon: Game Freak and Creatures Inc
  Key takeaways:
  - Game Freak is the developer and Creatures Inc. is the publisher
  - Game development took six years with setbacks and living off of Satoshi's dad's money
  - Pokémon required recoding from scratch for American version
  - Unlike other Game Boy games, Pokémon's success continued to accelerate
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Yes. Game Freak raises money from Creatures Inc. Who I think the right way to kind of think about it is Creatures Inc. Is the publisher and Game Freak is the developer.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, I think Creatures also manages the trading card game.
  Speaker 2
  Okay, makes sense. So they then spend six years developing the game for people over six years with a whole bunch of setbacks, living off of basically Satoshi's dad's money because they're living in his basement and trying to survive off of him having a real job. And in 1996, it's finally ready and they launch it. Yep.
  Speaker 1
  I believe it was red and green in Japan initially and then it was red and blue in the US.
  Speaker 2
  Oh, you're right. And the whole thing is so unbelievably frail that when they go to translate it and make an American version, they actually need to recode the whole thing from scratch because it's like spaghetti code everywhere. So it does well, but unlike every other Game Boy game that peaked and started trailing off, this thing just accelerates and it just goes and goes and goes and everyone at Nintendo is shocked. Everyone at Game Freak is shocked. Everyone at Creatures is shocked.
  Speaker 4
  No one expected this thing to be this successful, especially after taking six years to bring it to market with basically four crazy people. Yeah. ([Time 1:34:58](https://share.snipd.com/snip/865fe178-8fb3-49d4-a656-0e1d553f6ad7))
    - **Note:** Pokémon took 6 years to develop was a crazy bug collecting game from 4 people who everyone thought wouldn’t succeed but Miamoto saw promise and helped them post forward. They lived in a basement for 6 years and it was crazy they just created something so amazing.
- Nintendo's Vulnerability to Mobile Gaming and the App Store's Impact
  Key takeaways:
  - Nintendo was vulnerable to mobile gaming and lost its gaming market share to it
  - Microsoft and Sony were not vulnerable to mobile gaming
  - The Wii was the casual gaming console and not the Mario console
  - Nintendo took a decade to revitalize its mid core IP with the dedicated platform - the switch
  - Nintendo's struggle is reflected in their stock price
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So that's 2006, 2007 time frame. The App Store's launch on mobile late 2008 into 2009. And that just sucks all of this away. And this is the problem about shooting themselves in the foot. They were so vulnerable to this in a way that Microsoft and Sony weren't because the core gaming market and the hardware and the platforms that Microsoft and Sony were putting out, they weren't threatened by mobile. Mobile didn't take share from them, but it took like all of Nintendo's share. Right.
  Speaker 2
  Because the Wii was not the Mario console, the Wii was the casual gaming console and the greatest casual gaming experience in the world launched and fell right into everybody's pocket a few years later that swept out their entire current market away from them. And then it took them a decade to basically go back to their roots with the switch and figure out how to like revitalize all the mid core Nintendo IP onto a platform that was dedicated and best in class for that use.
  Speaker 1
  This is like the really sad part of the story. They just get rugged here.
  Speaker 2
  And you could see it in the stock price. It is nuts. When you look at when Iwata came in and took over in 2002 and we talked about the we was released ([Time 1:53:55](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b749982a-e065-4bf9-a3f4-e7461743488e))
    - **Note:** Mobile rugs Nintendo they went afyer that market but the iPhone was just much better in casual gaming and they only refocused on mid core games with the switch. Xbox was fine because it was hardcore gamers.
- The Origins of the Nintendo Pokemon Google Relationship
  Key takeaways:
  - Niantic collaborated with the Pokemon company and Nintendo to develop Pokemon Go
  - Niantic was a spin-off from Google
  - Ingress was a game developed by Niantic that paved the way for Pokemon Go
  - The initial spark for the Pokemon Google relationship was the 2014 Google Maps Pokemon challenge prank
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Do you know how the Nintendo Pokemon Google relationship starts? No. So, Niantic, which developed Pokemon Go in collaboration with the Pokemon company and Nintendo was one of the main shareholders of the Pokemon company was a spin out from Google. And Niantic was the team that within Google had made the mobile location based game Ingress that Ben was just talking about, which was super geeky and like really fun. But it was basically Pokemon Go without the Pokemon.
  Speaker 2
  Yeah, it was like a test of the infrastructure and to develop the right game mechanics. And the IP that it was using was sort of an old sci-fi novel, but it wasn't like exactly one to one.
  Speaker 1
  That's right. But the spark of this relationship actually goes back to 2014 and the 2014 April Fool's joke. Google loves April Fool's jokes. And I had forgotten about this until I read about it and the research and then I was like, Oh, yeah, which was the Google Maps Pokemon challenge. So on April Fool's day 2014, Google released a video saying they were recruiting for a new position within Google that was like the, I think they called it like, PokeMaster or something like that, like the Google PokeMaster and that it was a competition to get this job. ([Time 2:08:36](https://share.snipd.com/snip/bcdf5ede-96ca-47dc-b98a-c45f4ee6dd85))
    - **Note:** Nintendo ends up capitulating but does it on their terms and create things like Pokémon go that help and fans their space in the industry. They still keep their hardware angle and by time to figure out what to do and how they give us up like investors one of them to and just focus on IP they may have died.
- Nintendo's hardware philosophy and precarious position
  Key takeaways:
  - Nintendo prioritizes creating innovative hardware for new gaming experiences
  - Nintendo faces a more precarious position than in the past due to competition from mobile devices
  - Nintendo prioritizes hardware innovation over immediate consideration of business models
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Make really fun games on hardware that pushes the envelope on what types of experiences are possible for people. So I think if they get a be in their bonnet about a new hardware idea that they think is groundbreaking and will enable a whole bunch of new game experiences, they're going to do that and then they will figure out the business model implications later.
  Speaker 1
  I think the thing that is a little scary and we'll see how much this is imprinted on Nintendo. The Wii U debacle and when smartphones came out really existentially challenged Nintendo for the first time ever, like they could afford to have that philosophy during the 90s and the 2000s when they had the handheld business to save them every time. They could kind of do whatever the hell they wanted and it was fine. There was no existential risk. We've seen now even with all the incredible success from the switch and the $5 billion of annual operating income that they're generating right now. They're in a much more precarious position. Like if they don't get things right, consumers will just leave and go back to mobile. They can't do another Wii U.
  Speaker 2
  Now we're full on in bull and bear. So let's just pull that forward and do it now. ([Time 2:44:08](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9d6c562f-cc87-46e8-86b7-37cd1889322f))
    - **Note:** The switch became everything it needed to be forward backwards compatable became a trusted device in the ecosystem just found the right product market fit for a gamer category but can they continue to deliver?
- The Quality Concept in the Nintendo Switch and How It Counter-Positions Against Smartphone Gaming
  Summary:
  Shigeru Miyamoto has a great line that is a delayed game is eventually good. And I'm not sure it's the best way to run a business, but it is thebest way to create art. When you look around at like Activision, EA, the people making the big decisions do not care about the art. They are running spreadsheet businesses. Yes. It's somewhere in between.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  There's a great line that Shigeru Miyamoto has, which is a delayed game is eventually good. A bad game is bad forever. So good. I think about this all the time. Ever since I first read the quote when we were first starting researching three months ago, it is something I think about a lot for acquired episodes. It's like we loosely have a schedule. You know, we do six episodes every six months, but you and I just keep canceling stuff when we're like, eh, quality's low. And I'm not sure it's the best way to run a business, but it is the best way to create art.
  Speaker 1
  Yes. Which to our discussion about? What is it that the people who work at and run Nintendo think they're doing there? Yes. It's somewhere in between. Right.
  Speaker 2
  They really do value the art. And I think that's pretty rare. When you look around at like Activision, EA, the people making the big decisions do not care about the art. They are running spreadsheet businesses. ([Time 3:01:58](https://share.snipd.com/snip/520b9447-555d-4fea-b131-d251ba3c8ee4))
    - **Note:** This quote is amazing. Delay is better than bad care about the art.
- The Evolution of Gaming and Human Nature, as Illustrated by the Nintendo Story
  Key takeaways:
  - Nintendo's success and failures are intertwined
  - Nintendo's greatest strengths are also their greatest weaknesses
  - The speaker wonders why Nintendo is not owned by Disney
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  A 135, 140 year old company story without it fundamentally boiling down to being like, human nature is human nature. And the Nintendo story just illustrates so much for me that the seeds of success are shown in a fall and the seeds of a fall are shown in success. The Nintendo story with the ups and downs, the falls came from their successes and the successes came from their falls. Right.
  Speaker 2
  Yeah, their greatest strengths are their greatest weaknesses. Yes. All right, so my last one is kind of a what would have happened otherwise. And that question is, how is this company not owned by Disney? ([Time 3:08:44](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1136d50e-589a-431f-80fb-7774c4450cc2))
