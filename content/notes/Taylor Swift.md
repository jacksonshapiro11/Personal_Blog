  I think that's right. Well, what this makes me think of is, like, the auto industry and tesla, right? Like, before tessla, it wasn't like cool de via, at least in silican valley, to be like a car person anymore, like everybody drove a preus. Cause i goi don't care about cars, you know. But was it that really, like cars weren't something that could be part of people's lives in the same way any more? Or just that nobody had made a car target it at that demographic, right?
  Speaker 1
  That you could use to signal within your community? Ye.
  Speaker 2
  So t swift decides, in her own, inimitable fashion, that she's going to host her own audition this time. So rather than going back on the circuit, out to all the labels now that she's a free agent, she books the bluebird cafe in nashville, which is like a legendary venu, and was where garth brooks was discovered. She invites all the label execs in town to come see her perform.
  Speaker 1
  She's the michael ovits of the ten music industry in nashville, right she's like holding an auction for her herself rather than trying out. ([Time 0:28:54](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6330bd6e-94ad-4a08-869e-714359e2fb06))
    - **Note:** Both these parties initially were taking a big shot on each other but they were both all in. Big machine records takes a minority investment from tswifts dad and she’s their first customer. People wanted to make her a pop singer and not let her write her own songs. She wanted to sign country and write everything this allowed her to do this. Copyright of songs is the recording and the music essence these both need sign off to get things done. She starts going direct to fans through MySpace. Wanted to do this since she was 3. Music industry like vcs wiry very little residual for the artist. She knows her power comes from her fans directly she does this to an extreme. Understand your value chain. She loves ownership. At 15 she created an album and through her fan connections works it to #1 amazing talent and songwriting combinded with creating an audience that didn’t exist. The Kanye moment literally triggers the changing of the entire economics of the music industry.

  Speaker 2
  So this is the first very, very extended song riting session for material for the new album, which would come out in 20 12. Course, we're talking about red a. So they make the album tailorand and big machine. Usual, she uses nathan chapman again as her producer. Ah, you know, it's all, it's straight over, tackle, down the middle, tailor stuff, exactly what you know, t a label and the music industry would say to do you've just had this momently, give the fans more of what they want. They make the whole album. And tailors like, no, this is too similar to the old stuff. If i'm not learning and growing and doing new stuff, i'm not going to do it. So big machine wants to release the album, and she's like, noe. I'm going to re do it.
  Speaker 1
  Is that how it ended up with a 22 track album?
  Speaker 2
  That could be maybeh whythere's so many tracks. So this is when she brings in max martin and shelbeck, the famous swedish producers who had worked with britney spears and back street boys. And they'd just done e maroon fives moves like jagger. And she's like, work, we're going full pop with a lot of this, and we're goin to have a whole new a whole new sound. Oh, that's right. Red was super poppy even before we hit 19 89. But it's got this skitz oprantic vive, right? Like there's some country on it still, but then there's max martin and shelback on it too. So i think it's great. The other thing i didn't realize about red until now, album title is red. And if you look at the cover. You know, it's taylor sort of looking down. Te photo of her face is a reference. I think there's like a double easter egg in this.
  Speaker 1
  Oh, taylor's, the whole stickis triple, quadruple easter eggs nested in the album mare and the inside booklet of the album, and all the other crazy stuff ye can research.
  Speaker 2
  So i can think of two easter eggs. One is the obvious one, is it's referencing jone mitchell's blue album.
  Speaker 1
  We got a link to that from the show notes, cause the thing that you sent me, like, the album cover is clearly modelled off wofh blue, clearly.
  Speaker 2
  It's like both shots of their face king down. And you dont blue verses red. I think the other one it's probably referencing is the lean rhymes album. Interesting.
  Speaker 1
  A thing i want to point out here is we've been on a pretty steady track to date where she releases a 15 to 20 song album every other year. So you got o, six, o, eight, 20, ten, 20, 12, 20, 14. So she's averaging writing and releasing writin and recording ten songs a year. So we'll just seed plant that for now. That was the first decade of her career, and we'll come back to it, ye.
  Speaker 2
  And it would be, again, another two year break before the next album. Whitches, of course. 19 89.
  Speaker 1
  So many bops, so many earworms, no igess, so many, like, popular videos that come along with it. All. This one, to me, was taylor swift hitting the main stream and saying, i am for everyone. And if you look at her instagram follower count to day of just about to hit 200 million, she is indeed for everyone. She'sike, totally transformed herself to, you know, the, she's always tryind to have a little bit this like, girl next door, you know, everyone's friend, trying to do the right thing, vibe. And here she's just like, blowing the doors off that and being like, you like apple pie in america? I have taylor swift for you.
  Speaker 2
  And i think everybody in the orbit, unteam taylor, knew that like, this was going to be really big, cause, o red was, it was half po buti it was really successful. Red did not win the grammy for album of the year, which i think taylor still kind of resents, and she hadn't won one since fearless, right?
  Speaker 1
  Yes, i don't think. I don't think. Speak now on red, didn't win. Speak now, didn't win. And it's funny, were saying, didn't win, yep. It's as if it's some kind of loss if the album that you released that year didn't become the album of the year, which i think is how taylor views it. That is totally how taylor views it. In fact, that's the opening scene of miss americanas when she gets the call that reputation wasn't nominated. And she immediately switches into this mode of saying, oh, ok, well, i will write a better album. That's ok. I'll make a better record.
  Speaker 2
  Not only didn't win, but wasn't even nominate id like that's like of which, in retrospect, that was a mistake, yes.
  Speaker 1
  But look, let's go to 19 89. Welcome to new york. Blank space style. Shake it off. Bad blood, wildest dreams.
  Speaker 2
  I mean, it's unbelievable. She's always bortin the vadries, like, she does two things, one, which is just so fun and totally in the tailor cultivating the direct relationship with fans. She picks a small number of fans based on their like engagement on social media, how engaged they are in social media. And she does this at her various houses and properties around the country. She invites them over for secret listening sessions of the album before it comes out. Under nd a, they can't talk about what's on the album, and she bakes them cookies. Incredible. And of course, like photographs and eovidios the whole thing and posted on social vedia, like freak and brilliant, right?
  Speaker 1
  And the lore that comes from those ten people getting to say, i was there, and eventually post pictures or anything like that, she just gets a tremendous amplification of anybody feeling like that could happen to them, totally.

    - **Note:** She’s constantly pushing herself to reinvent herself and grow in directions she wants not play safe and produce good records like the record company wants she wants go sun album of the year I’d bust and does crazy things that people don’t do like personal listening parties to better connect with fans. Taylor writes an op ed in the nyt about his music shouldn’t be free so she and others in the industry can make money. She stands up for what she believes she becomes her for speaking out. Taylor fights streaming pulls all her songs off Spotify after a week of releasing her album. She also fights Apple Music on royalties and wins they weren’t going to pay any for 3 months Taylor herself gets this reversed she wields massive power. Reputation is a product of life of Pablo hit track against her and the public turns against her she needs to look more internally for approval this is also her last record on her contract. She then has her catalog sold to scooter Braun who was Kanye’s guy she hates spins up a narrative and re-records them all. She had so much power in the industry and reshaped it for her liking helping others in the process. Reality distortion field over presenting her side she is the Steve Jobs of music.
