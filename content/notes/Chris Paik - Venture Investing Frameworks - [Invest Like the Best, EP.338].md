### Highlights

- The Value of Offering and Franchising Men to a New Class of Creators
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Let me say it back to make sure I captured the idea right. It's incredibly valuable to offer and franchise men, I guess is the word, to a new class of creators that previously could not have been productive. And if you do that, this is like the whole thing is Bill Gurley or somebody at Benchmark told me like, you can't start a new social network with existing celebrities. It has to be with new celebrities that you've made possible. Is that a fair summary?
  Speaker 1
  I could not agree more.
  Speaker 2
  That's right. Charlie Demelio. Yep. TikTok. TikTok. She's a dancer.
  Speaker 1
  If you think about it, dance as a form of content, disenfranchised on platforms prior to really appreciate dance. You need to hear the music. But audio is never a native endemic form of content consumption on Instagram. It was always visual or Snapchat visual. And TikTok was the first platform that made audio a native part of the content consumption along with video. And so dance was elevated from this completely backwater.

    - **Note:** The value of new tech enabling new innovations and this is the true cause of disruption. Compelling why now. The future is here not evenly distributed. Product market fit and business model market fit. Linux has product market fit but no business model fit. 
      Business models buy widgets for less than you sell them for. Help people make money and take a cut ie market place. You get paid to save people time convience economy
- Understanding the Concept of Value Swap
  Key takeaways:
  - The concept of value swap is essential to understand exchanges in various contexts.
  - In exchanges, there should be a balance between what is expected in return and what is being delivered.
  - The reasons behind people's actions are often driven by exchanges that involve costs and benefits.
  - Twitter is a platform where content creators focus on increasing their distribution rather than making money.
  - Medium's attempt to monetize its content consumption violated the original value swap with content creators and led to its failure.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Consip to the atomic value swap is what is actually going on? What is the exchange that is happening? Let's take this to a lay example. I walk into a grocery store. I want to buy a head of lettuce. I pay two dollars for this head of lettuce. The value swap is two dollars in exchange for the secular to secular exchange of money for goods. That's very easy to understand. If the grocery store wanted to charge twenty dollars for that head of lettuce, that exchange probably wouldn't happen. The imbalance, the asymmetry between what is expected in return for what is being delivered won't achieve a market clearing mechanism. What's interesting is applying this to things that aren't maybe as easily measured from a quantitative perspective. It boils down to why do people do things? Period. Because it costs everyone something to do anything. What are they getting in exchange for the time expended, the effort expended, the money allocated? How durable is that exchange? How repeatable is that exchange? Does it increase in attractiveness over time? Does it decay in attractiveness over time? Is it a one-time thing? Let's think about a company.
  Speaker 2
  Twitter is an interesting one.
  Speaker 1
  Twitter is a really interesting one. Let's think about why people do things on Twitter. Why does a content creator create content on Twitter? I would argue that somebody creates content on Twitter to increase the distribution of their thought and future thoughts, future content. No one makes money on Twitter. People create content on Twitter to become more famous, become more successful, basically build their distribution and it's baked into the follower model in and of itself. Conversely, there are some platforms that no one makes content for to increase distribution. They only do it to monetize. Patreon is a good example of this or Shopify. Nobody creates content on Patreon to increase their distribution. They are likely increasing their distribution in other spheres, whether it's they have a podcast or they have a YouTube channel or a Twitch channel. They are using Patreon as a monetization mechanism for the pre-existing distribution that they already have. Going back to Twitter's atomic value swamp, this is why the idea of a paywall is so scary for Twitter because the only reason why people are creating content on Twitter is to increase their distribution. What happens when you introduce a chilling effect to distribution? Arguably, this is why I think medium failed as a product. Medium originally was a tool that allowed people to more aesthetically or on brand in the way that they wanted to distribute their content. It was good content. Theoretically, it would be more widely disseminated. But Medium wanted to monetize their traffic and they thought they had enough leverage to install a paywall on the consumption side. The issue with that is that violated the original atomic value swamp with content creators originally. When you change the balance of the values on the scale, sometimes it no longer makes the original atomic value swamp actually market clear or repeat.

- Founder Market Fit and Earned Insights: The Power of Intuition
  Key takeaways:
  - Founder market fit and earned insights are important for product development.
  - Intuition and earned insights allow the leader to build the product without external input.
  - Founder market fit and earned insights are accumulated over long periods of time.
  - Earning insights slowly or quickly can impact the product development process.
  - Sourcing talent from the edges can lead to innovative ideas.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Maybe more tactically, I might be able to articulate founder market fit and earned insights, how they manifest. So the founder has the correct intuition about a product. So you start compounding those things and you sum total, well, we don't have to test this thing because I intuitively know for X, Y, and Z reasons, I have this earned insight. I was the customer. And so I know that we need to build it in this way. And then the company and the product building process is so much faster, because intuitively, the leader knows exactly what needs to be built without having to ask anyone else. So I like to think about founder market fit, earned insights, how long of a period of time this person has basically been collecting the dust of insight over usually very long periods of time, and then are able to compress it into these diamonds that somebody else starting from zero wouldn't be advantaged with.
  Speaker 2
  So it's really the pathway of slowly versus quickly earning an insight. Literally could just be that simple. There's just some core thing that you couldn't have known. I do not spent the 10 years in the muck, either as the customer or as someone trying to produce the outcome or whatever. If you think about other sources of where these people might start to emerge, the idea of sourcing from the edges is really interesting to me.
