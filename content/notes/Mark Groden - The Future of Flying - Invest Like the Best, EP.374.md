  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I had a coach at the beginning of the company that I was 26 and a PhD in engineering, right? So not necessarily any good at communicating. So good at writing an equation on the board. Pretty good at solving it, but communicating why that mattered and what it meant to the world was obviously not the thing I'd been trained on and all parts of what I was bringing to the Table I was trying to improve it. So I was seeking out somebody to help me with speaking and I was really fortunate to get introduced to someone who was way outside of what I could afford. And obviously he knew that when he took the call, I didn't and he offered to coach me basically for free for years and has become a close friend since. At the time, I didn't realize the level of gift he was giving me when I met him, but since then, without that type of guidance, I don't think I would be here today. What has he taught you? A lot about the fundamentals of how to speak. I think it boils down to knowing what you want to say and having clear intention with the statement before you begin it. And it's interesting because I naturally think a lot before I speak, but I also have this ability to, which he's kind of brought out of me, to take things up to a much higher level, like 10,000 feet and just say what I want to say as opposed to here's all the details inside of it. And I think if I were to try and identify one thing, that's probably it. And the ability to show people my passion was really hard for me when I first started putting those two things together. I think he saw the passion on the inside, but I struggled to share it with people in a way that they could understand. I think it actually extends beyond speaking. It extends to this is the thing that I want to do with my life. This is what I'm putting all my life force into. And he helped me find the words to express that to other people. And this helped me in every single respect in the business, whether it's hiring people or raising capital or just building relationships, that ability to articulate why this matters So deeply to me and why for the right people, it should matter to them as well.
  Speaker 2
  Just one follow up question because it's a powerful lesson for those that struggle to articulate the thing they're passionate about. What would you say to them?
  Speaker 1
  What's interesting is the answer to the why, the second or third why, helped me a bit. And sometimes the answer to why you're passionate about something may not be obvious. But if you're really centered and you're really in tune with what that thing is, and it's coming from a place within and not because of some societal pressure or something that's happening In the world around you, but it's truly coming from inside you. And it's something that you identify with and you care about and I call it your truth. Then when you start to ask those why questions and really think about it and think about where you've been in the course of your life journey and how you've changed or the experiences You've had, it oftentimes becomes quite obvious.
