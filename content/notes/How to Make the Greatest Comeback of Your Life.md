- Summary: To make a meaningful comeback in life, you need to break free from societal conditioning and explore your true desires. Embrace mistakes as valuable learning experiences and focus on what you genuinely want instead of what others expect from you. By becoming aware of what you don’t want, you can redirect your energy towards building a fulfilling and unique path for yourself.

### Highlights

- When you go on a vacation, eventually, maybe after 2-3 weeks, it becomes normal to you. You get bored. It’s not a “vacation” anymore. It’s normal life. You want to get back to work. You want to do something, *anything,* that is just a bit more novel and interesting. Your mind craves balance, but not in the common sense of living a flat and miserable life. Your mind craves *contrast.*
  All of this is leading up to say one thing:
  *You aren’t where you want to be because you’re afraid of making mistakes.*
  I cannot express that enough.
  If there were one true sentence in which to orient your life, that would be it.
  Mistakes are nature’s compass.
  If happiness can’t exist without sadness, success can’t exist without failure.
  It is a *universal law. A pattern of reality. A phenomenon that has been around since the first sign of life, because something can’t exist without nothing.*
  You can make mistakes on the conventional path – schools and jobs – but you are still working toward a narrow goal. The mistakes don’t lead toward a new, better path, they simply lead to you feeling sorry for yourself.
  When you decide to be free – and reject the goals assigned to you at birth that made you think small and trapped you in this negative bubble of thoughts – your mistakes are your light in the dark. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg4xes5pp3tmk4yw3fk013xd))
    - **Note:** Mistakes guide you
- You absolutely cannot live a full, open, and non-robotic life if you operate by what your parents and teachers planted in your head. Sure, you can be happy at times, as all people are, but being deeply fulfilled is a different story. Most people haven’t experienced that feeling because it’s unknown to them, so they don’t bother searching for it and instead project their insecurities by telling you how fulfilled they are working as a robot would. The lines of code are engraved on their brain. Again, you can’t perceive what is a mistake if you don’t have a goal that allows you to.
  You must launch into the unknown, feel as if you are drowning, and learn how to swim. That is how you learn anything, and that is why most people learn nothing. They would rather jump off the deep end, complain about how hard it is (as if it were supposed to be any other way, or as if something that is hard is bad or negative rather than reality itself), and blame anyone but themselves for their inability to do anything without it being given to them.
  But all of my rambling up until this point doesn’t help with the fact that you are already drowning right here and now.
  So what do you do? How do you learn? How do you make the greatest comeback of your life?
  Get Mad At Where You Are
  The best periods of my life came after getting absolutely fed up with the lack of progress I was making.
  I didn’t care what I did. I just had to do something. I would try anything to get out of that situation. Most people would call that desperation, but I would call it a mind that’s hungry to learn, grow, and evolve to the next level.
  The goal isn’t to immediately find one thing that eases your pain.
  The goal is to accept a radical shift in how you live.
  You must realize that all of your actions compounded to where you are right now, and if you continue doing those things, you will remain where you are. The only real change is behavior change, so say goodbye to almost everything you hold onto so tightly right now that you think “aren’t that bad.” You clearly can’t manage them well.
  You must become disgusted with where you are.
  You must fabricate a mental rock bottom.
  Write down everything you don’t want in life.
  The stupid mind. The pudgy body. The sluggish energy. The dead-end relationships. Reject them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg4xq00d1zf6d0vnbmhytb0n))
    - **Note:** You can only make progress when you actually want to
