- Master Your Mind, Live in the Present
  Summary:
  The mind is constantly chattering, judging, replaying past events, and creating future scenarios.
  This habit can hinder happiness. To break free, one should aim to make the mind a servant, not a master.
  Cultivating experiences that help one get out of their mind can lead to living more in the present moment and accepting reality.
  Suppressing the mind doesn't work; instead, one should focus on unconditioning and guiding thoughts by feel.
  Changing habits requires understanding the triggers like availability and desire and consciously avoiding situations that fuel unwanted behaviors.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  But the reality is if you walk down the street and there are a thousand people in the street, I think all thousand are talking to themselves in their head at any given point. They're constantly judging everything that they see. They're playing back movies of things that happened to them yesterday. They're living in fantasy worlds of what's going to happen tomorrow. And they're just pulled out of base reality. And that can be good when you're doing long range planning. It can be good when you're solving problems. It's good for the survival and replication machines that we are. But I think it's actually very bad for your happiness. And so in my mind, the mind should be a servant or a tool, my master. It's not something that should be controlling me and driving me 24-7. So I've taken on this idea that I want to break the habit of uncontrolled thinking, which is hard because if I say to you, don't think of a pink elephant, I just put a pink elephant in your Head. So it's an almost impossible problem. So it's more something that has to be guided by feel than guided by actual thinking or thought process. But I'm deliberately cultivating experiences, states of mind, locations, activities that will help me get out of my mind. And I know all of society does at some extent. In some sense, the people chasing thrills and action sports or flow states or orgasms or any of these states that people really strive to get to, a lot of these are basically just trying To get out of your own head, they're trying to get away from that voice in your head and this overdeveloped sense of self. At the very least, I do not want my sense of self to continue to develop and become stronger as I get older. I want it to be weaker and more muted so that I can live much more in present everyday reality and accept nature and the world for what it is and appreciate it very much in the childhood and Then not have to seek happiness through external circumstances chasing to fit some preconceived notion that I have.
  Speaker 2
  Why there's a lot that I want to ask questions on.
  Speaker 1
  Is there a tough one that will take years? That's not a six month habit, that a ten year habit.
  Speaker 2
  Do you think there's a difference between turning off versus suppressing your monkey mind?
  Speaker 1
  Absolutely. Yeah, suppression doesn't work because when you try to suppress, that's the mind suppressing the mind. That's just you playing games with yourself. So I think it's a very hard problem.
  Speaker 2
  I want to go back to kind of unconditioning. You basically stop drinking alcohol. How did you work on deprogramming yourself from the social settings and environments that you're in where alcohol is probably available all the time and what benefits have you seen As a result of? Like are you isolating these habits when you're changing them so you know, oh I sleep better because I'm not?
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, the alcohol one is an interesting case study because the alcohol habit came from two things. One was availability. Just being in situations where alcohol is available and accepted and something you're supposed to do. And then the second is the desire, right? You want to do it because you're trying to accomplish something else. So when I unpacked that, I realized a couple of things. The availability came from, I'm just out, if I'm out at night in an environment where alcohol is being served as the availability. So if you want to avoid that, stay in.

    - **Note:** Control your mind and the stories you tell yourself don’t tell negative stories. It doesn’t help work on being present. Live in reality not a fantasy world. The mind is a constant stream of thoughts and you should control the mind not supress it. Accept the thoughts and live through them to be present
- Prioritize Your Health First
  Summary:
  Making your health the number one priority in life ensures that you make time for daily workouts without making excuses.
  By focusing on physical, mental, and spiritual health in that order, you set the foundation for prioritizing your family's well-being and then attending to other responsibilities. Establishing clear priorities prevents spreading yourself thin among numerous goals and ensures you dedicate time and effort to what truly matters most.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  What habit would you say most positively impacts your life?
  Speaker 1
  I think it's the daily morning workout that has been a complete game changer. It's made me feel healthier, younger. It's maybe not go out late. And it came from one simple thing, which is everybody says I don't have time. Basically, whenever you throw any so-called good habit at somebody, they'll have an excuse for themselves. And usually the most common is I don't have time. And I don't have time. It's just another way of saying it's not a priority. So what you really have to do is to say is it a priority or not? And if something is your number one priority, then you will get it. That's just the way life works. But if you've got a fuzzy basket of 10 or 15 different priorities, you're going to end up getting none of them. So what I did there was I basically just said my number one priority in life above my happiness, above my family, above my work is my own health. And it starts with my physical health, and then second is my mental health. And then third is my spiritual health. And then it's my family's health. Then it's my family's well-being. And then after that, I can go out and do whatever I need to do to the rest of the world. So there's a series of concentric circles starting out for me. And so because my physical health became my number one priority, then I could never say I don't have time. So in the morning, I just work out. And however long it takes is how long it takes. And I do not start my day. And I don't care if the world is imploding and melting down, taking weight in another 30 minutes until I'm done working out.

- The Essence of Happiness and Contentment
  Summary:
  Happiness is not a fixed state but a personal and evolving concept.
  It arises from the absence of desire and the feeling of contentment when nothing is missing in life. Happiness is not tied to positive thoughts but rather the absence of desire, especially for external things.
  By embracing the present moment and accepting reality as it is, one can find happiness.
  Understanding the insignificance of the self helps in letting go of expectations and leads to a neutral state, akin to the carefree existence of children, which is actually a state of contentment and perfection.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  You mentioned happiness being one of your top priorities. What is happiness to you? What does that mean? What does that word mean? Can you unpack that?
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, it's a very evolving thing. I think like all the great questions, when you're a little kid and you go to your mom and you say, what happens when we die? Is there Santa Claus? Is there a God? Should I be happy? Who should I marry? Those kinds of things. There are no good answers to that because there are no answers that apply to everybody. So these questions, the search for truth, these kinds of questions, they ultimately do have answers, but they have personal answers. So the answer that works for me is going to be nonsense to you and vice versa. So whatever happiness means to me, it means something different to you and it means something different to the listener. But I think it's very important to explore what it is. And for some people, I know it's a flow state. For some people's satisfaction, for some people, it's a feeling of contentment. The best, my definition keeps evolving. So the answer I would have given you a year ago would be different than what I tell you now. But today, I believe that happiness is, it's really a default state. It's what's there when you remove the sense that something is missing in your life. And we are highly judgmental survival and replication machines. We're constantly walking around thinking, I need this. I need that trapped in the web of desires. And happiness is that state when nothing is missing. And when nothing is missing, your mind shuts down and your mind stops running into the future or running into the past to regret something or to plan something. And then in that absence for a moment, you have internal silence. And when you have internal silence, then you are content and you are happy. I think people believe mistakenly, you know, feel free to disagree because again, it's different for everybody, but people believe mistakenly that happiness is about positive thoughts And positive actions. But the more I've read, the more I've learned, the more I've experienced because I verify this for myself, every positive thought essentially holds within the negative thought. It's a contrast, something negative. The doubt A. Ching says it's more articulately than I ever could, but it's all duality and polarity. So if I say, I'm happy, that means that I was sad at some point. If I say he's attractive, then that means that somebody else is unattractive. So every positive thought even has a seed of a negative thought within it and vice versa, which is why a lot of greatness and life comes out of suffering. You have to view the negative before you can aspire to and then appreciate the positive. So all that said, long-winded, to me, happiness is not about positive thoughts. It's not about negative thoughts. It's about the absence of desire, especially the absence of desire for external things. And so the fewer desires I can have, the happier I can or more accept the current state of things, the less my mind is moving because the mind really exists in motion towards the future Or the past, the more present I am, the happier and more content I will be. But if I latch onto that, if I say, I'm happy now and I want to stay happy, then I'm going to drop out of that happiness because now suddenly the mind is moving, it's trying to attach to something, It's trying to create a permanent situation out of a temporary situation. So happiness to me is mainly not suffering, not desiring, not thinking too much about the future or the past, really embracing the present moment and the reality of what is the way it Is. Because nature has no concept of happiness or unhappiness. To a tree, there is no right or wrong, there is no good or bad. Nature follows unbroken mathematical love and a chain of cause and effect from the big thing to now. And everything is perfect exactly the way it is. It's only in our particular minds that we're unhappy or not happy and things are perfect or imperfect because of what we desire. But I think I've also come to believe in the complete and utter insignificance of the self. And I think that helps a lot. Like for example, if you thought you were the most important thing in the universe, then you have to bend the entire universe to your will because if you're the most important thing in The universe, then how could it not conform to your desires? And if it doesn't conform to your desires, something's wrong. However, if you view yourself as a type of a material in a mea, or if you view all of your works as writing on water or building castles in the sand, then you have no expectation from how life Should actually be. Life is just the way it is. And then you sort of accept that and you have no cause to be happier and happy because things almost don't apply. And what you're left with in that neutral state is not neutrality. I think people think, oh, that would be a very bland existence. No, this is the existence that little children live. And if you look at little children on balance, they're generally pretty happy because they're really immersed into the environment in the moment without any thought of how it should Be given their personal preferences and desires. So I think the neutral state is actually a perfection state. And one can be very happy as long as one isn't too caught up in their own heads.
  Speaker 2
  What does your internal monologue go like when you find yourself trying to attach to something by default? ([Time 0:28:39](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e8b42f48-d291-4ac3-ad3f-a66a1a6c24be))

- Foundational values for personal and professional relationships
  Summary:
  The speaker values being in an environment where honesty is key to avoid creating internal conflicts, believes in long-term thinking for relationships and business, prefers peer relationships over hierarchical ones, and rejects the idea of anger, aiming to surround themselves only with non-angry individuals.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I never want to be in an environment around people where I have to watch what I say because if I disconnect what I'm thinking from what I'm saying that creates multiple threads in my mind, That means that I'm no longer in the moment. That means that I now have to work future planning or past regretting every time I'm talking to somebody. So anyone around whom I can't be fully honest, I don't want to be around. Another example of foundational value is I don't believe in any short-term thinking or dealing. So if I see anybody who's even around me, like let's say I'm doing business with somebody and they think in a short-term manner with somebody else, then I don't want to do business without Person anymore because I think all the benefits in life come from compound interest, whether in money or in relationships or love or health or activities or habits. So I only want to be around people that I know I'm going to be around for the rest of my life and I only want to work on things that I know have the long-term payout. Another one is I only believe in peer relationships. I don't believe in hierarchical relationships. So I don't want to be above anybody and I don't want to be below anybody. If I can't treat someone like a peer and if they can't treat me like a peer, then I just don't want to interact with that human. Another one is I don't believe in anger anymore. I mean, that was something that was good when I was young and full of testosterone, but now I always like the Buddha saying that anger is a hot cold that you hold in your hand while waiting To throw it at somebody. So I don't want to be angry and I don't want to be around angry people. ([Time 0:39:35](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fca7fe71-6564-4928-a20e-64da706df227))

    - **Note:** Your mind is constantly running a program and that is your operating system and if you don’t like it, it is your duty to reprogram the operating system, and it can easily be reprogrammed. Focus on your foundational values and live up to those. Changing freedom from things freedom from being tied down to freedom two things freedom to spend time with your family. You’re born do you have a series of sensory experiences and you die and how you choose to interpret those is up to you and that ends up becoming your life. You can observe and control your mental states and you need to recognize the supreme agency in yourself and take steps. See how you think and then observe it and then change how you think. You can control how you respond and interpret situations. You must see your monkey mind in action before you can positively shape it. Life is a single player, not a multiplayer game and you can’t get mad or envious of what people have. You must have an internal scorecard or your hosed. You must do this work individually only the individual transcends. Don’t start with the macros start with the micros.
      reprogram and dominate your mind. You have agency
- Starting as a Loser Leads to Finding the Winning Path
  Summary:
  Starting out with a mindset of being a loser and not fitting into societal norms can actually lead to finding success.
  By not being concerned with fitting in or conforming, individuals are more likely to carve out their own unique path to success. Taking notes while reading is compared to taking photos on a trip, both actions take you out of the present moment.
  The speaker believes in staying focused on the present and not dwelling on the past.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Do you think there's some sort of loss aversion there because once you diverge, you're pushing out, say there's a Gaussian distribution, you're pushing out to one of the tails. And if you feel that you're going to lose out on that, you'd rather just stay in the middle if there's a chance that you're not going to be in the fat tail for a positive. Absolutely.
  Speaker 1
  I think that's why the smartest and most successful people I know started out as losers. If you view yourself as a loser, as someone who's been cast up by society and has no role in normal society, then you will do your own thing and you're much more likely to find that winning Path. So it helps you to start out by saying, oh, I'm never going to be popular. I'm never going to be accepted. I'm already a loser. I'm not going to get what all the other kids have. I'm just going to be happy to be me.
  Speaker 2
  Yeah. I think that's true. When you're reading, do you just read and it sticks in your head? Or is it more like you take notes? Do you have a system for how you keep track of that or review them?
  Speaker 1
  I'm both lazy and I'm really focused on being present. So I think taking notes is the same as taking photos when you're on a trip. All it's doing is taking you out of the moment. Then who really sits there years later and goes back and looks at all their trip photos and gets an oscillator? Just go take your next trip. So I just don't believe in anything from the past, anything. ([Time 1:17:25](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b1eab48c-1d6a-4ac3-b67a-bb137a252bd8))
    - **Note:** The greatest people are non-contrarian losers who either can’t care or don’t care about how people think of them. Read differently. Don’t worry, compare yourself to the past over on the present. He studied complexity theory, and realized how little we knew about the world and spent the rest of his life trying to avoid mistakes because he knows how often we’re wrong and so if we can just avoid mistakes, success will come. Use judgment to figure out what system you’ll thrive in and then put yourself in that system. You can’t be successful everywhere. Find your niche. Set up good systems for your life. You don’t need to do anything you just need to do what you want to do. Don’t listen to the voice in your head that tells you what other people want you to do focus on what you wanna do because no one can beat you at you. Find your unique differentiation and build systems based on yourself don’t use others checklists. Integrity and a strong, moral compass do the right thing. You need to do the right thing so you have self-esteem because if you don’t love yourself in this world who will we all know who we are. We cannot hide failures from our psyche. Don’t do things your not proud of. Easy choices hard life hard choices easy life. Explain complex things in simple ways. Smart thinkers are clear thinkers who understand from first principles and can explain things simply
- Building Mental Models for Success
  Summary:
  Success is heavily reliant on decision-making prowess, as being right a higher percentage of the time can yield exponential value.
  The key lies in leveraging modern technology and resources to enhance decision-making skills. This involves understanding that the brain operates as a memory prediction machine, requiring the application of mental models rather than relying on past events for future predictions.
  Mental models derived from evolution, game theory, and influential figures like Charlie Munger and Nassim Taleb are crucial for making informed decisions.
  Embracing complexity theory and acknowledging the limits of prediction capabilities can help navigate uncertainty effectively.
  Success is not just about making correct judgments but also about avoiding mistakes by eliminating what may not work. By employing mental models to assess trust, odds, and margin of safety, one can make informed decisions. Adopting a system-oriented approach, instead of fixed goals, allows individuals to create conducive environments for success, focusing on statistical likelihood for positive outcomes.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Making is everything. And in fact, someone who makes decisions right 80% of the time, so 70% of the time, will be valued and compensated in the market hundreds of times more. And I think people have a hard time understanding that, but that's a fundamental fact of leverage. If I'm managing a billion dollars and I'm right, 10% more of the time than somebody else, and that's $100 million worth of value on a judgment call. And with modern technology and large workforces and capital, our decision is getting leveraged more and more. So if you can be more right, more rational, and that's one of the reasons why I love your blog, because it really focuses on helping you be more right, better decision making and more rational, Then you're going to just get non-linear returns in your life. So decision making is everything. And decision making, what's going on? Basically, the brain is a memory prediction machine. It has a memory of things that work in the past and what it's read and it's trying to predict the future. And the lousy way to do memory prediction is X happened in the past, therefore X will happen in the future. It's too based on specific circumstances. So what you want is you want principle, you want mental models. So the best mental models that I have found have come through Evolution, Game Theory, and Charlie Munger, who I'm sure you quote a lot in your blog, but Charlie Munger was Warren Buckett's Partner, very good investor, but he has tons and tons of great mental models. Naseem Taleb has great mental models. The Benjamin Franklin had great mental models. So I basically load my head full of mental models. But then different ones apply to every situation. So I don't really want to checklist. But for example, I studied a lot of complexity theory when I was younger. It's a field that I got into. I got an occasion I just get into these things and I just learn a lot about that field. And my most recent one is cryptography, but I was really into complexity theory back in the mid 90s. And the more I got into it, the more I understand the limits of our knowledge and the limits of our prediction capability. And that's been super helpful to me. So that has helped me come to the system that operates in the face of ignorance. And I believe that fundamentally we're ignorant and very, very bad at predicting the future. So I don't look for, and I don't believe that I have the ability to say what is going to work. So rather what I try to do is I try to eliminate what's not going to work. So I think being successful is just about not making mistakes. It's not about having correct judgments. It's about avoiding the incorrect judgments. So I have mental models around how do I determine if I can trust somebody around what are the actual odds that this is going to work? How much margin of safety do I have? If it works out, the angel bets and venture bets are great because they've not been your outcome in the positive, but on the downside, you can only lose one X. But on the upside, you can make 10,000 X. So I try to rig the game. So I don't believe in specific goals. Scott Adams also set up systems, not goals. So use your judgment to figure out what kinds of environments you can thrive in and then build a system to create that environment around you so that you're statistically likely to succeed. ([Time 1:23:11](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6926c598-9de3-4ce5-b1f4-1f90a37fb858))
    - **Note:** Create systems not goals.
- Embrace Reality to Make Meaningful Change
  Summary:
  Having a strong sense of self and being free from preconceived notions allows us to see reality clearly and make meaningful changes.
  The clouding of reality often occurs when we mix our desires with what truly is. Suffering can be a moment of truth when we are forced to confront reality as it is, leading to the opportunity for meaningful progress.
  To see the truth, one must set aside the ego, as the ego tends to avoid facing reality.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  By not having a strong sense of self or judgments or mind presence, the monkey mind will always respond with this regurgitated emotional response to what it thinks the world should Be. And that will cloud your reality. This happens a lot of times when people are mixing politics and business. Like for example, in January this year, I were like a little piece on the election that kind of predicted that Trump or Bernie is going to win. One of those two characters is going to win. That's not what I wanted to have happen necessarily. I'm an elite. My life is pretty good. Right? I'm not looking for a rabble rousers to change everything. But I wanted to see reality the way it was as opposed to the way I wanted it to be. So I think the number one thing that clouds us from being able to see reality is just that we just have preconceived notions of the way it should be. There's one definition of a moment of suffering is that it's that moment when you see things exactly the way they are. So this whole time you've been convinced your business is doing great and really you've ignored the science that's not doing that well, then your business fails and you suffer. Well, it's just because you've been putting off reality, you've been hiding it from yourself. So the good news is that when you're suffering, when you're in pain, that's a moment of truth. That is a moment where you're forced to embrace reality actually the way it is. And then you can make meaningful change in progress because you can only make something, you can only do that when you're starting with the truth. So I think the hard thing here is seeing the truth and to see the truth, you have to get your ego out of the way because your ego doesn't want to face the truth. ([Time 1:41:01](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fd807136-a246-4e2a-b78f-1a030f43a1f9))
    - **Note:** Moment of suffering is when you can see the world how it really is because once you’re suffering, and you see the truth and you see your failures only then in that failure, can you start to make change. In the moment of suffering, we cannot see reality clearly like we can give other people good advice that we wouldn’t take ourselves because our mind is clouded by that suffering and pain. The more desire you have to see things a certain way the less likely you are to see the truth so when things aren’t going well, you need to acknowledge them very openly to friends and coworkers. Don’t hide failures and delude yourself. Success and company is idea plus execution plus passion there are very few new ideas under the sun. Great people have great outcomes over the long-term, but may not come quickly. Current, you is very tired and wants to just go home but future you is this really perfect person who can do anything in the world and so obviously this isn’t true what you need to do is considered deeply the commitments you’re making two factor authentication for your calendar. No external thing will ever make you happy.
