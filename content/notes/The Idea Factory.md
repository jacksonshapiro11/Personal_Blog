### Highlights

- Bell labs measured success in decades not years and set up with long term incentives. The goal was to take the smartest people they could find from different disciples and walks of life and have them attack the hardest problems believing they could be solved. These people were encouraged to think past the day to day and look at strategic opportunities years in the future. Western electric and AT&T had the combined lab but decided to spin it out into an independent company for research with $150mm in seed funding. Modern industrial research was made to apply science to every day life. Believed a team of scienctists was better than the individual and that they weren’t looking for good ideas but good problems. Bell labs sought to be at the leading edge of what ant company could achieve both from a manufacturing and pure science progression and research angle

- The lab started to scale on the depression where the lab could offer 2x what graduate students would get at universities. These recruits were flagged for high potential through a network of scouts who were professors from universities flagged to Kelly. Often these people were from small rural towns who had high school teachers tap their potential and work after school to get them more subject area knowledge and learn past the curriculum. Created a magazine that circulated the new ideas of the time and brought in outside scholars as well as having inside scholars give lectures. Bell labs was critical for AT&T as they not only needed to make phone service faster and better as more lines/nodes got added to the network, which on balance hurt the overall network load but they needed to make it cheaper as well. Bell labs was working in a problem rich environment. The system was the name for the entire phone network which the bell engineers simply called the system. The system demanded so much durability flexibility and new invention it lead to a. Constant invention and innovation. They were trying to perfect a system that never could be perfected and would rigorously test and try near everything

    - **Note:** The importance of robust talent pipelines and taking advantage of a crisis to scale. The bell labs system was such a nerd snipe an amazing problem rich environment that demanded better cheaper faster with no possibility of perfection. The labs were critical to maintaining this. They also helped circulate ideas quickly.

    - **Note:** Bell Labs had a strong pipeline of candidates and saw the depression as a time to pounce and in this crisis they were able to build a great stable of talent because they were one of the only places hiring. Also the importance of mentorship and giving people a shot and going the extra mile for no other reason than altruism. Importance of information especially in a lower information time period.

- In 1940 the lab became fully focused on science for war. In this war time Jews were hired for the first time and the lab was behind radar one of the biggest inventions that helped win the war. They worked 6 days a week. Fiske became a rising star rivaling Kelly as leader of the lab both being large contributors

    - **Note:** Kelly created a meritocracy that was cross disciplinary in nature not predicated on experience
- This time at the labs the progress in theory was met by progress by a progress in materials research. Research into alloys became very popular and it was shown how the tiniest impurity in an element could have an outsized effect. The solid state team ie the semi conductor team a superstar team with the smartest minds at bell labs. Semi conductors function at such small scales it basically relied on creating theory then trying to find experiments to test the theory the learning environment was very difficult. Transistor was chosen as the name of the semi conductor and it was a grand invention at bell labs inventions moved up middle management weeks at a time so they could be tested and vetted

    - **Note:** This innovation was the a players of a players and required great advances in materials science as well as the invention of computation as we know it from almost nothing. This changed the course of human history and was so ground breaking people think aliens did it. Step change on step change. Both deep theory and innovations in metals and atoms.
      Crazy how none of this research seems to connect yet it all did to change the world blind walk and synthesis. No one knew what this even was and it took so many people to come together to birth it
- The bell labs team wanted to patent and announce the transistor as soon as possible because they didn’t know if another lab was close. Moreover they decided to license the tech given they were already operating a legal monopoly in their phone business and didn’t want the government asking further questions. When the transistor was finally announced only an expert in solid state physics could understand it as it tied together a world class knowledge of metallurgy quantum mechanics and electrical engineering. Showed the value of cross disciplinary learning. Shockley was a bit jealous of not being more involved in the direct discovery as this had been an area of interest for him for many years

    - **Note:** This was a world altering discovery that was made open by the AT&T monopoly and the wealth and diversity of knowledge at the labs. Shockley was fairly jealous and this lead to a change in his management style which caused a riff at the lab
- The semiconductor team was put together from both a material science and theoretical physics lens A players from different areas had to combine to create this breakthrough innovation shows the value of smart people in a supportive environment being able to tackle a very hard problem

    - **Note:** The transistor was a complex innovation that tied together inventions from disparate areas creating something so complex only a few could understand it.
- The point contact transitor was the original then Shockley the leader of the group so off put and hurt he didn’t invent it came up with the idea of a junction transitor which was 2 n type germanium blocks with p type germanium in the middle this innovation violated the ideals of a manager not overstepping his place and supporting his team but stepping over them and further hurt the norms of open discourse valued in the group. The transitor was almost as big as an invention as the atomic bomb. The new device was a direct replacement for the vacuum tube but it’s full use was not clear until later. The public did not see the value of the transistor but the electronic industry did and mit suggested using it for computers. The transitor was both a discovery in the pure science of it and an invention in the actual device. Transitor physics was a discovery. The idea of discovery vs invention. It wasn’t a innovation yet which was a new idea or novelty being integrated into society. The path from an idea into a technological process or product in wide spread public use was a technological innovation. This usually meant innovation was larger than 1 person or organization/group because the task was too involved. AT&Ts position as the world largest monopoly was vital to bells labs because it had infinite money and power. While this was a big invention initially they were so fragile they didn’t work so they were handed off to the development team who’s chief concerns were reliably reproducibility and designability. Needed to make this more standardized and reliable. While it was a team of superstars shockleys management style lead to the disillusion of the team causing them to break up. From a PR perspective the transistor was a godsend any anti competitive hoopla was put down as they handed out the transitor to people like it was candy. Appeased govt

    - **Note:** The transistor was given away for free to help AT&T maintain their monopoly.
      This was on the path of an innovation which is to productization of an innovation into the mass market. The transitor was a master class of an Invention.
      Shockleys team was amazing but he got embarrassed they had created something better than him so he worked hard by himself to develop something better. His ego destroyed the norms of the group and hurt the culture of innovation. A players and good story of ego vs team. You must cultivate and enable open discourse to be successful
      The ironic thing is the at and t monopoly accelerated computation by years because they had to give this away. Would’ve made them tons. It’s very tough to figure out what will be important don’t the line this innovation defined the next 100 years but no one really knew that.
      Innovation path and violating trust.

    - **Note:** Productization of a discovery is the full innovation pipeline. An innovation is something that combines a discovery of pure science and invention or engineering feat that becomes a used process or product in the world. The transitor required both metallurgy and information processing to create this contraption that went into computers that everyone now uses. Innovation the productization of a discovery.
- Information Theory description
  Shannon was more interested in the nature of problems not necessarily implementation. Always looking for root or first principles. Treated information as a quantity not a thing. Was focused on how well you can send messages. There’s always noise in messages and you want to limit the noise and maximize the signal. Information is the ability to resolve uncertainty. Information provided the recipient the ability to get something not previously known not redundant. The essence of information is the core uncertainty that is resolved by its receipt. Signal through the noise. The less the recipient knows about what comes next the more information is being revealed. There are often common language patterns the reveal less information or nuanced complicated ones that reveal a lot of information. For example a u following a Q gives little information because U often if not always follows Q. Named the amount of new information in a message bits. Choice made from 2 equally likely possibilities. All communication can be thought of as information information can be measured in bits and all information should be thought of digitally. Viewed all information as the same. Everything has both an information capacity and information content. Something can never exceeds it’s information capacity but can fall short of its information content. Like the capacity of information passed in a football game has a ceiling but that doesn’t mean it will reach that ceiling in practice. So this trade off is a great yardstick to measure a transmission. Using error correcting codes could reduce error to as low as you want by raising the bar higher. Workers with the most patents often talked with Harry nyquist who was able to draw people out and have them investigate their own thinking more deeply and grow their own ideas further. He asked good questions

    - **Note:** Information theory is about distinguishing signal from the noise. Information is the uncertainty resolved by introducing something new (a message) into the environment. Information gain is the amount learned from a message. Information content is the information in a message while the capacity is the total information that can be carried in a message. More predictable (probable) means lower information gain likewise less probable more info gain.
      Information resolved uncertain this is the gain there is a capacity and a content. The lower probability the higher gain. Harry nyquist find yours. Harry nyquist in the age of ai

- Workers with the most patents often talked with Harry nyquist who was able to draw people out and have them investigate their own thinking more deeply and grow their own ideas further. He asked good questions - Harry Nyquist was not the smartest or most innovative person at the labs but seemed to be the mid point for all the successful people at the labs he drew ideas out of everyone because he asked good questions
- Bell labs had the best people and helped teach those who weren’t up to par they needed a critical mass of smart people and they made market ready products companies needed. You get paid for 7.5 hours but you get promoted fir what you do in the other 16.5. The unlimited funding from AT and T was vital to the lab. Bell labs was operating a monopoly but they used the work they did for the government as leverage and the work they did was vital and couldn’t be replicated by any other country. The USA decided to keep the monopoly because the science offshoots were too great. While the germanium was used for the initial semi conductor it had many drawbacks and after much testing silicon was favored especially as germanium was rare and silicon was incredibly common. Bell labs invented a trabsitor after many iterations but simplifying the process and just trying something basic off this was a solar cell which was invented by 3 people in 3 different buildings showing the cross disciplinary work

- There were many sections of the labs there was the pure science thinking in decades then there was development and system engineers which was concerned with the upkeep of the system. In development mistakes were not excusable and this group aimed at goals as ambitious as the scientists. Better or cheaper or both. They built a trans Atlantic cable and they tested things rigorously ie they would tear vacuum tubes in mud for 25 years rigorous as a result the cable stood roughly uninterrupted for 20+ years

- John Pierce- Things can be understood and learning in science is understanding. He was a genius and excelled in school and ended up going to cal tech which had a direct line into bell labs. He was eccentric and very quick but often humble and attributed his success to luck those around gym considered him a genius.

- Inventions don’t evolve into the innovations one might foresee humans shove new ideas into old paradigms. Everyone faces the future with their eyes on the past and they don’t know what is going to happen next.

    - **Note:** Innovations don’t follow from invention you need a paradigm shift to change the way to see the world. Tech enables innovation but we can’t cast the past on future you need to create not abstract. We see the future as like the past and cast our innovations in past light but this doesn’t unlock the emergence of innovation. You need to shift the Overton window.
      Progress happens when we make new things and see the world differently invention + integrated in paradigms. Face the future with the eyes on the future not the past and respect emergence
- Inventions don’t evolve into the innovations one might foresee humans shove new ideas into old paradigms. Everyone faces the future with their eyes on the past and they don’t know what is going to happen next – our models are built form yesterday but need to be applicable for tomorrow

- Bell was in the satalite business and helped launch the first one into space but the government didn’t like how involved they were in the space race and banned them from building more satalities. In building this they used old research from the 30s that became vital to the project

    - **Note:** Monopolies government interference, and learning from the past. Bureaucracy nonsense.
- Bill baker leader at the lab. Science rests on foundation of inquiry not certainty. Baker was verbose and his mind was nimble and flexible in all situations he was a big question mark to many though. Baker was a chemist thought progress was understanding the composition of materials and creating new and better ones when possible chemistry was at the middle of production and science. Innovations not improvements on the old but exponents on the new like the transitor that created a whole new problem space. In semi conductors better science started being done outside bell labs than inside it which was the start of the end I would think
  “A very small number of times in my life I’ve been in the presence of somebody who didn’t necessarily answer the question I asked. They answered the question I should have asked,” Pollak says. “And Bill Baker was one of those people. And there are other people who just build a mystique and give the impression of a mystique around them. And Bill had that, too.”

- The picture phone was seen as the future of the labs but in the end it never delivered because the market research was flawed and the group caved to groupthink. In a networks effects business the network effect never got started and thus the whole project ended up being innovative but too early and an abject failure. Bell thought picture phones were the next telephones but the high bandwidth and prices were not to be and it flopped – this is a great lesson in how to build a failed technology despite being in one of the most intelligent organizations and staking the future on picture phones the market research was inadequate and the network effects were non existent and despite being a cool innovation it failed only to be resurrected by jobs and apple to great success timing of innovations
- In the 70s the government was less pro the monopoly as it had been and AT&T was starting to lose their grip on the legal monopoly they had come to expect to operate. At and ts monopoly was becoming much less popular in Washington and it was being broken up
- Invention of cell phones – The cellular network vs the picture phone was one that benefited from network effects as well as optimized the use of scarce resources. Cell phones had limited radio frequencies available so instead having powerful towers the network used less power so frequencies can be reused when they were out of range of another tower using their frequency. The towers were organized in hexagons to optimize space they were cells of hexagons ergo the cellular network. Instead of increasing power they inverted to get more out of the limited frequencies available. The benefit of this system is because it used the already installed radio base everyone had access to everyone else and there was already an existing network effect.

    - **Note:** Cellular networks are an amazing example of using network effects and solving a constraint optimization problem by inversion. They lowered frequency to get more use of limited signals. The picture phone had no install base while radio had the network effect. Rode the radio wave to create phones.
      Network effects install base and inversion
- Instead of considering mobile phones to have high range frequencies and few radio frequency options two scientists, ring and ray, came up with the idea of creating hexagons of low frequency connections that allowed for wider reach of the phone system. Instead of a circle with a connection in the middle a hexagon with lower frequencies. Each frequency was partitioned across the hexagon towers so while the amount of frequencies available were limited using this method could get much higher utilization and eventually the car phone would switch to another frequency while driving eventually driving so far their original frequency was available without threat of interference. Each hexagon was a cell. The network was a cellular network. This was filed away and not viewed at first as important but it allowed a high utilization of smaller amount of frequencies. Later another researcher dug up this work on cellular networks and used this as a basis for cell phones.

- Frankle joined bell labs in the mid 60s and at this time gone was the individual scientists doing world altering research now bell labs defaulted to big teams on years long projects. Frankle picked up ring and pierces cellular network paper for mobile phones. At bell labs to get ahead you were supposed to work on more than just your day job and spend 20-30% of your time doing something different and ad hoc. Bell labs would often throw 10-100mm at project they didn’t know would work. Cellular phones tested bad in marketing research. “Marketing studies could only tell you something about the demand for products that already exist and didn’t work for technologies people had to imagine it exists. We were young and unscared by failure we always knew cellular phones were going to work”. Cellular users differed from picture phone because cellular phones connected to the same system as normal phones so had an install base where the picture phone needed an entirely new install base

    - **Note:** The invention of cellular networks benefited from a strong install base/network effects of existing phones unlike the picture phones which were a new thing entirely. The importance of technology being built on each other and network effects this paper was discovered decades after being published and became the basis for the entire cellular network. You get paid for what you do in the non expected working hours. The difference between marketing people who are seeing the world as it is and abstracting and innovators creating the world for themselves
      Ignorance is bliss stand on shoulders of giants and network effects. Youthful ignorance. Marketing vs innovation
- Systems engineers had to integrate cell phones. The network architecture was the key but the intel processor was the tech that fully enabled the project

    - **Note:** Merging the right people with the right technology. Product market fit. To other engineers the system could not have been built much like a book can be a doorstop or catalyze $1Bn idea
- After the regulatory break up the labs had to become more actionable and less high minded. This lead to a shorter time horizon of thought which lead to a lower quality of output and less research for research sake which lead to less innovation. Innovation requires one to take a trip blind through a forest without the expectation of finding anything only the hope of doing so. The labs became more practical and applied not the place of fiske and baker and lost the ethos

    - **Note:** When you compromise on values it all falls apart. Innovation requires one to take a trip blind through a forest without the expectation of finding anything only the hope of doing so. Research is low delta and hard to predict but can move mountains. This is a great example of drift in performance
      Performance drift absolute standards. Values
- Bell labs ended up being a casualty of the AT&T regulatory break up many at the time thought the labs would survive but this was not to be
    - **Tags:** #monopolies, #system-destruction
- Bell labs after the break up wasn’t the same as the old one as there was no purpose or mission the buildings stood unchanged but the ethos was dead and thus the lab was dead. The mission was essential but it was gone and not replaced. Post the break up AT&T had to market to consumers not regulators and they didn’t do this well and thus the company made less money and could allocate less to the labs and the markets became more competitive so long term thinking in 40 year increments was replaced with 3 year look forwards. Doom loop. Focused more constrained at bell labs with less research into theory for research sake. Innovations became more incremental in nature rather than transformative breakthroughs. Then it got a boost as part of lucent before it was ultimately shunned when lucent cratered. The labs became more practical and applied not the place of fiske and baker

    - **Note:** Bell labs was a product of the AT&T monopoly that gave everyone the freedom to make mistakes but when that was gone and ideas had to be more practical the doom loop was set into action. When you lose the mission and dream you lose the heart and soul and everything is dead it's just a matter of time. You need the moon shots and the culture. They previously had low probability but high EV inventions and they went to high probability low EV inventions. You need to be non consensus and right
      Negative compounding, need for failure in innovation, long short term misalignment and mission driven is how to build an organization
- With more information were bound to become slaves to our technology but the tech is there to serve us not the opposite – “Important in the future of tech is designing ways to get away because the path set by bell labs will be dehumanizing one issue being solved only to lead to another. The only important part of technology is how well it serves man.”
- Why the labs were successful Innovation occurs by the movement of scientific ideas in one direction. Innovation. Could come from anywhere so having a great organization of capable people is key to great scientific progress. The key was an interdisciplinary group of people working and sharing together. The labs clearly benefited from their monopoly and the Silicon Valley approach to innovation has been validated but some believe a collaborative rather than competitive environment does the most long term good for innovation

    - **Note:** The lab was a place where A players came together to innovate and try different ideas and learn from each other. The groups and disciplines were all together and the cross pollination created many great ideas.
- When more information is available at home there is less of a reason to go into town and meeet people and the processing of info gets tougher as increasing reliance of internet data supplants our desire or need to think deeply. Net is chipping away our capacity for concentration and contemplation we take in info how the net distributes it. Future networks more like biological systems of information and information growth.

    - **Note:** The internet is chipping away at our concentration and as we spend more time on line we need to understand technology serves us not the other way round. We can’t become reliant on the internet and tech we need to continue to be able to think for ourselves. We can’t dehumanize people with tech we need to enable them with it.
      Bell labs and Silicon Valley mindset of cooperation over competition and a critical mass of smart people coming together to become more than what they could be alone.
- Bell labs was successful because it created the right system and incentives getting the best people to operate in the system.
    - **Tags:** #incentive-structures, #systems-thinking, #critical-mass-of-smart-people
    - **Note:** Building the right system is vital and domain dependent
- The labs had both a great process and organization like have jobs bezos ect all under one roof with amazing phd grads and infinite funding this all set the scene for the revolution that was bell labs no one thing defined it but the whole system lead to progress. John pierce in the ended wanted to be remember with the lab for the progress it made and people who made it not for being cogs in the machine

    - **Note:** The labs had great people coordinate to break from the mold and make a stamp on reality. They are the right group and place and time optimizing for agency. Great system
- Workers with the most patents often talked with Harry nyquist who was able to draw people out and have them investigate their own thinking more deeply and grow their own ideas further. He asked good questions

    - **Note:** The most productive workers at the labs all talked to this one person who was able to draw ideas out of them.
