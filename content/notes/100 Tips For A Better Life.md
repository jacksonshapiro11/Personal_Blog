### Highlights

- [17.](https://jessegalef.com/2020/08/09/a-pretty-good-mathematical-model-of-perfectionism/) Done is better than perfect.
  18. Keep your desk and workspace bare. Treat every object as an imposition upon your attention, because it is. A workspace is not a place for storing things. It is a place for accomplishing things.
  19. Reward yourself after completing challenges, even badly. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxexw4tqzvwtqgpa8mn5zc1g))

- **Success**
  [25.](https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/the-origin-of-the-img-tag/#:~:text=The%20img%20tag%20was%20included,hard%20to%20change%20its%20implementation.) History remembers those who got to market first. Getting your creation out into the world is more important than getting it perfect.
  [26.](https://80000hours.org/2018/08/randomised-experiment-if-youre-really-unsure-whether-to-quit-your-job-or-break-up-you-really-probably-should/) Are you on the fence about breaking up or leaving your job? You should probably go ahead and do it. People, on average, end up happier when they take the plunge.
  27. Discipline is superior to motivation. The former can be trained, the latter is fleeting. You won’t be able to accomplish great things if you’re only relying on motivation.
  28. You can improve your communication skills with practice much more effectively than you can improve your intelligence with practice. If you’re not that smart but can communicate ideas clearly, you have a great advantage over everybody who can’t communicate clearly.
  29. You do not live in a video game. There are no pop-up warnings if you’re about to do something foolish, or if you’ve been going in the wrong direction for too long. You have to create your own warnings.
  [30.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias) If you listen to successful people talk about their methods, remember that all the people who used the same methods and failed did not make videos about it.
  31. The best advice is personal and comes from somebody who knows you well. Take broad-spectrum advice like this as needed, but the best way to get help is to ask honest friends who love you.
  32. Make accomplishing things as easy as possible. Find the easiest way to start exercising. Find the easiest way to start writing. People make things harder than they have to be and get frustrated when they can’t succeed. Try not to.
  33. Cultivate a reputation for being dependable. Good reputations are valuable because they’re rare (easily destroyed and hard to rebuild). You don’t have to brew the most amazing coffee if your customers know the coffee will always be hot.
  [34.](https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/06/07/annie-dillard-the-writing-life-1/) How you spend every day is how you spend your life. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxexmrwnzrk6wxfea9tfe9mj))
    - **Note:** if youre on the fence about something do it lower the barriers of doing things communication skills and you dont live in a video game you need feedback loops
- **Rationality**
  [35.](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/497611-science-is-a-way-of-trying-not-to-fool-yourself) Noticing biases in others is easy, noticing biases in yourself is hard. However, it has much higher pay-off.
  [36.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) Explaining problems is good. Often in the process of laying out a problem, a solution will present itself.
  [37.](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qNZM3EGoE5ZeMdCRt/reversed-stupidity-is-not-intelligence) Foolish people are right about most things. Endeavour to not let the opinions of foolish people automatically discredit those opinions.
  [38.](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/N47M3JiHveHfwdbFg/hammertime-day-10-murphyjitsu) You have a plan. A time-traveller from 2030 appears and tells you your plan failed. Which part of your plan do you think is the one that fails? Fix that part.
  39. If something surprises you again and again, stop being surprised. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxey5dsek0xxya2fye5hbbgy))

    - **Note:** elephant on your shoulder explain problems and use post mortems. Adjust your model of reality change your mind. Opinion of others not important. Think systematically
- **Self**
  43. Deficiencies do not make you special. The older you get, the more your inability to cook will be a red flag for people.
  [44.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_thyself) There is no interpersonal situation that can’t be improved by knowing more about your desires, goals, and structure. ‘Know thyself!’
  45. If you’re under 90, try things.
  [46.](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/on-white-people-acting-white/) Things that aren’t your fault can still be your responsibility.
  [47.](https://putanumonit.com/2020/09/12/against-victimhood/) Defining yourself by your suffering is an effective way to keep suffering forever (ex. incels, trauma).
  48. Keep your identity small. “I’m not the kind of person who does things like that” is not an explanation, it’s a trap. It prevents nerds from working out and men from dancing.
  49. Don’t confuse ‘doing a thing because I like it’ with ‘doing a thing because I want to be seen as the sort of person who does such things’
  [50.](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7457932-death-hangs-over-thee-while-thou-livest-while-it-is) Remember that you are dying.
  51. Events can hurt us, not just our perceptions of them. It’s good to build resilience, but sometimes it isn’t your fault if something really gets to you.
  52. If you want to become funny, try just saying stupid shit (in the right company!) until something sticks.
  [53.](https://twitter.com/QiaochuYuan/status/1276515256504774656) To start defining your problems, say (out loud) “everything in my life is completely fine.” Notice what objections arise.
  54. Procrastination comes naturally, so apply it to bad things. “I want to hurt myself right now. I’ll do it in an hour.” “I want a smoke now, so in half an hour I’ll go have a smoke.” Then repeat. Much like our good plans fall apart while we delay them, so can our bad plans.
  [55.](https://www.sensophy.com/why-epiphanies-dont-work/) Personal epiphanies feel great, but they fade within weeks. Upon having an epiphany, make a plan and start actually changing behavior.
  56. Sometimes unsolvable questions like “what is my purpose?” and “why should I exist?” lose their force upon lifestyle fixes. In other words, seeing friends regularly and getting enough sleep can go a long way to solving existentialism. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxfnvsdxavk698y57b0p3grw))
    - **Note:** deficiencies dont make you special keep your identity small
- 57. There are two red flags to avoid almost all dangerous people: 1. The perpetually aggrieved ; 2. The angry. - sum of your 5 closest friends surround yourself with winners
  58. Some people create drama out of habit. You can avoid these people. - avoid drama
  59. Those who generate anxiety in you and promise that they have the solution are grifters. See: politicians, marketers, new masculinity gurus, etc. Avoid these. - hucksters and fraudsters make you fear then promise answers.
  [60.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-7o9xYp7eE) (~This is not legal advice!~)
  DO NOT TALK TO COPS.
  61. It is cheap for people to talk about their values, goals, rules, and lifestyle. When people’s actions contradict their talk, *pay attention!* - actions express priorities
  62. “If they’ll do it with you, they’ll do it to you” and “those who live by the sword die by the sword” mean the same thing. Viciousness you excuse in yourself, friends, or teammates will one day return to you, and then you won’t have an excuse. - peoples character doesn’t change if they fuck someone else they’ll fuck you too ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxfp0h9kxm3k37ac9tp670n5))

    - **Note:** avoid things and people that make you feel bad. Hang around the right people with good morals who are happy and have agency the world isn’t out to get them. Avoid drama and grifters. Bad character is constant. Actions expresses priorities.
- [65.](https://putanumonit.com/2020/02/27/seeing-the-smoke/) You will prevent yourself from even having thoughts that could lower your status. Avoid blocking yourself off just so people keep thinking you’re cool.
  66. Being in groups is important. If you don’t want to join a sports team, consider starting a shitty band. It’s the closest you’ll get to being in an RPG. Train with 2-4 other characters, learn new moves, travel from pub to pub, and get quests from NPCs.
  67. It’s possible to get people to do things that make you like them more but respect them less. Avoid this, it destroys relationships.
  68. Think a little about why you enjoy what you enjoy. If you can explain what you love about Dune, you can now communicate not only with Dune fans, but with people who love those aspects in other books. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxfp4yscvt2y0zx7rmxmer8s))
    - **Tags:** #build-respect, #status, #cultive-relationships, #system-vs-point-change, #community-formation, #respect, #meta-analysis, #follow-what-gives-you-energy
    - **Note:** understand mental models and have standards. Take actions that build respect cultivate communities and relationships. Find your meta traits of enjoyment and use that to connect with people who might like different point but similar system things as you.
      Don’t follow the stairs path follow what you love choose your path and happiness
- **Compassion**
  [82.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAtGGZjVRdo) Call your parents when you think of them, tell your friends when you love them.
  83. Compliment people more. Many people have trouble thinking of themselves as smart, or pretty, or kind, unless told by someone else. You can help them out.
  84. If somebody is undergoing group criticism, the tribal part in you will want to join in the fun of righteously destroying somebody. Resist this, you’ll only add ugliness to the world. And anyway, they’ve already learned the lesson they’re going to learn and it probably isn’t the lesson you want.
  85. Cultivate compassion for those less intelligent than you. Many people, through no fault of their own, can’t handle forms, scammers, or complex situations. Be kind to them because the world is not.
  86. Cultivate patience for difficult people. Communication is extremely complicated and involves getting both tone and complex ideas across. Many people can barely do either. Don’t punish them.
  [87.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17fRzsbcME0) Don’t punish people for trying. You teach them to not try with you. Punishing includes whining that it took them so long, that they did it badly, or that others have done it better.
  [88.](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/222576-we-are-as-forlorn-as-children-lost-in-the-wood) Remember that many people suffer invisibly, and some of the worst suffering is shame. Not everybody can make their pain legible.
  89. Don't punish people for admitting they were wrong, you make it harder for them to improve.
  90. In general, you will look for excuses to not be kind to people. Resist these. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxfp9hk3v6peb7jffda83k2j))
    - **Note:** Be a more compassionate person
- 91. Human mood and well-being are heavily influenced by simple things: Exercise, good sleep, light, being in nature. It’s cheap to experiment with these.
  [92](http://studiahumana.com/pliki/wydania/In%20Praise%20of%20Passivity.pdf). You have vanishingly little political influence and every thought you spend on politics will probably come to nothing. Consider building things instead, or at least going for a walk.
  [93.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law#) Sturgeon’s law states that 90% of everything is crap. If you dislike poetry, or fine art, or anything, it’s possible you’ve only ever seen the crap. Go looking!
  94. You don’t have to love your job. Jobs can be many things, but they’re also a way to make money. Many people live fine lives in okay jobs by using the money they make on things they care about.
  95. Some types of sophistication won’t make you enjoy the object more, they’ll make you enjoy it less. For example, wine snobs don’t enjoy wine twice as much as you, they’re more keenly aware of how most wine isn’t good enough. Avoid sophistication that diminishes your enjoyment.
  96. If other people having it worse than you means you can’t be sad, then other people having it better than you would mean you can’t be happy. Feel what you feel.
  [97.](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HmfxSWnqnK265GEFM/are-wireheads-happy) Liking and wanting things are different. There are things like junk food that you want beyond enjoyment. But you can also like things (like reading) without wanting them. If you remember enjoying something but don't feel a desire for it now, try pushing yourself. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxfpdp0y1g7nvq1g22v4znja))
    - **Note:** great things are simple dont become a snob avoid politics
- [99.](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-43492-001) There’s some evidence that introverts and extroverts both benefit from being pushed to be more extroverted. Consider this the next time you aren’t sure if you feel like going out.
  100. Bad things happen dramatically (a pandemic). Good things happen gradually (malaria deaths dropping annually) and don’t feel like ‘news’. Endeavour to keep track of the good things to avoid an inaccurate and dismal view of the world. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxfpcxktjb1ejcy31184d30f))
    - **Tags:** #introvert, #extrovert, #good-things-take-time, #bad-things-happen-fast
    - **Note:** bad things happen fast be more extroverted. Good is slow bad is fast.
