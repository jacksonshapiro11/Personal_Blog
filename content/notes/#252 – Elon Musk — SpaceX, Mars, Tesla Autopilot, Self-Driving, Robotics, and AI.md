### Highlights

- Elon Musk’s Advice for Young People: Be Useful for Society
  Key takeaways:
  - Try to be useful and contribute more than you consume
  - Read broadly and learn as much as possible
  - Find something you're inherently good at, enjoy doing, and will have a positive impact
  - Avoid a zero-sum mindset and work on adding to the economic pie
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Look up to you, millions of people look up to you. Uh, if we think about young people in high school, maybe in college, um, what advice would you give to them about if they want to try to do something big in this world, they want to really have a big positive impact? What advice would you give them about their career, maybe about life in general?
  Speaker 1
  Try to be useful. Um, you do things that are useful to your fellow human beings to the world. It's very hard to be useful. Um, very hard. Um, you know, are you contributing more than you consume? You know, like, uh, like, can you, try to have a positive net contribution to society? Um, I think that's the thing to aim for, you know, not to try to be sort of a leader for, just for the sake of being a leader or whatever. Um, a lot of times people who, who, a lot of times people, the people you want to be leaders are other people who don't want to be leaders. So, um, if you live a useful life, that is a good life, a life worth having lived. Um, you know, and I, like I said, I would encourage people to, uh, use the mental tools of physics and apply them broadly in the way that they're the best tools.
  Speaker 2
  When you think about education and self-education, what do you recommend? So there's the university, there's a self-study, there is a hands-on sort of finding a company or a place or a set of people that do the thing you're passionate about and joining them as early as possible. Um, there's, uh, taking a road trip across Europe for a few years and writing some poetry, which, uh, which, which trajectory do you suggest? In terms of learning about how you can become useful, as you mentioned, how you can have the most positive impact.
  Speaker 1
  Well, I encourage people to read a lot of books. Um, just read, like, basically try to ingest as much information as you can, uh, and try to also just develop a good general knowledge. Um, so you, so you at least have, like, a rough lay of the land of the, the knowledge landscape. Um, like try to learn a little bit about a lot of things. Um, because you might not know what you're really interested in, how would you know what you're really interested in if you at least aren't, like, doing it, peripheral exploration of broadly of, of the knowledge landscape. Um, and, and, and, you talk to people from different walks of life and different, uh, industries and professions and skills and occupations, like just try, you know, learn as much as possible. Man's search for meaning.
  Speaker 2
  Isn't the whole thing a search for meaning?
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, what's meaning of life and all, you know, but just generally, like I said, I would, I would encourage people to read broadly, um, in many different subject areas. Um, and, and, and then try to find something where there's an overlap of your talents and, and what you're interested in. So if people may, maybe good at something, but, or they may have skill at a particular thing, but they don't like doing it. Um, so you want to try to find this thing where you have your, that's a good, a good combination of, of your, of the things that you're inherently good at, but you also like doing.
  Speaker 2
  Um, and, um, and reading is a super fast shortcut to, to figure out which, where are you both good at it? You like doing it and it will actually have positive impact.
  Speaker 1
  You got to learn about things somehow. So reading, a, a broad range, it's just really, read it. You know, one point was I kid, I, I, I read through the encyclopedia. Uh, so that was pretty helpful. Um, and, uh, those are things that have even existed, a lot. So obviously, and it's like as broad as it gets. It's like, here's where it's adjustable, I think, uh, you know, whatever 40 years ago. Um, so, um, you know, maybe read through the condensed version of the encyclopedia Britannica. I'd recommend that. Um, you can always like skip subjects where you, you read a few paragraphs and you, you know, you're not interested. Just jump to the next one. So read the encyclopedia or scan, scan through it. Um, and, um, but I, you know, put a lot of stock and certainly have a lot of respect for someone who puts in an honest day's work, uh, to do useful things. And, and just generally to have like, uh, not a zero sum mindset, um, or a, like have, have more of a grow the pie mindset. Like the, if you, if you sort of say, like when, when I see people like perhaps, um, including some very smart people, kind of taking an attitude of, uh, like, like, like doing things that seem like morally questionable, it's often because they have at, at a base sort of axiomatic level a zero sum mindset. Um, and, and they, without realizing it, they don't realize they have a zero, a zero sum mindset or at least they don't realize it consciously. Um, and so if you have a zero sum mindset, then the only way to get ahead is by taking things from others. If, if it's like, if the, if the, if the pie is fixed, then the only way to have more pie is to take someone else's pie. But, but this is false. Like obviously the pie has grown dramatically over time. So the reality, in reality, you can have the, so overuse this analogy, we have a lot of, we can have this, a lot of pie. Yeah. My pie is not fixed. Um, uh, so you really want to make sure you don't, you're not operating, um, without realizing it from a zero sum mindset where, where the only way to get ahead is to take things from others, then that's going to result in you take, trying to take things from others, which is not, not good. It's much better to work on, uh, adding to the economic pie. Maybe, you know, so, uh, create creating, like I said, create creating more than you consume, uh, doing more than you. Yeah. Um, so that's, that's the big deal. Um, I think there's like, you know, a fair number of people in, in finance that, do you have a bit of a zero sum mindset? I ([Time 2:25:48](https://share.snipd.com/snip/bc7e6dcc-22da-41aa-a325-619248425ef8))
    - **Note:** Find what you’re uniquely good at and leverage that for positive sum societal good.
