### Highlights

- Obviously, resourceful people make great COOs, bug-hunting programmers, and entrepreneurs in the more “operator” mold. But those stereotypically resourceful people are kinda uninteresting. What interests me a lot more is people who are relentlessly resourceful in the larger game of ordinary life, outside of hero’s journeys. People for whom resourcefulness is not just a way of life but the very definition of it, with anything short of an of-course-it’s-worth-it attitude being some degree of deadness. As the world gets ever-more complex, it’s the resourceful who increasingly inherit the future. Anyone who wonders too long whether life is worth living is increasingly likely to conclude that it is not due to the sheer difficulty of thinking about the question honestly. Only those who don’t bother to ask the question will ever choose life at all.

    - **Note:** Don’t be the person who does things that’s not resourcefulness it’s deeper. It’s constantly seeing the world and thinking how you can shape it constantly working and tinkering in all situations. Not thinking too much about the high in the sky stuff but executing on life constantly.
      Resourcefulness as a way of life.
- Most of us have a kind of meta-process going on in our head anytime we’re in a trial-and-error mode. At what point do I cut my losses and quit? At what point do I just toss this frustrating broken thing and buy a new one? At what point do I just give up on a plan entirely and choose to forgo something? The resourceful person rarely asks is this worth it, because by a rarely questioned default, it always is. Resourceful people have extremely stable commitments to extremely stable goals and desires, by default. It’s not specific goals and desires. They’re that way about all goals or desires. If it’s worth doing, it’s worth doing. When you consider that as a revealed Weltenschauung, a life-scale worldview and attitude, you could say that the resourceful person is one who has a remarkable level of faith in the idea that of course life is worth living. Unlike the philosopher who has to examine life to make it worth living, for the resourceful person, the answer is clear without any need for self-examination. The fully lived life is not worth examining. To the resourceful person, if you want something, that’s part of living life, so of course it’s worth relentless trial-and-error to get. To want at all is to want life. There is an endearing sort of infinite-game firmware loop deep down somewhere. The point of the resourceful life is to continue playing. To continue wanting. In a curious way, the superpower of the resourceful person is simply the ability to care deeply and unquestioningly about their own life.
