- Drive Excellence Through Accountability and Direct Confrontation
  Summary:
  To drive excellence, one must be judgmental, hold people accountable, make tough decisions, and have extreme product and go-to-market strategies.
  Confronting problems directly and having honest conversations is key to success. Building a great product is essential, but integrating it with a strong go-to-market organization is where differentiation lies in the industry.
  The focus should be on creating a culture of accountability, intellectual honesty, and executing well, rather than just on the product side of the business.

  Speaker 1
  But in regards to lessons I've learned, one of the big lessons I've learned is that to drive excellence, you need to be incredibly judgmental. And most people, when push comes to shove, are afraid to make the decisions they need to make to be truly successful. They're not willing to hold people accountable that need to be held accountable. They're not willing to be extreme about the product decisions that need to be made, the way products are positioned with a price, and they're not also going to be extreme about the go-to-market Decisions. And what I find is most people fold with the pressure to make hard decisions. And I think that's why there's a lot of very average and mediocre companies out there. And I think really confronting problems directly and dealing with them directly, most people are social animals. Most people don't want to have a painful conversation. Most people don't want to point out the flaws and what people are doing. And so in many cases, you have these very passive-aggressive meetings, everyone nods politely. But in the back of the mind, they said, this is probably not going to work. We work really hard to create a culture where we can be intellectually honest about what's working, what's not working, have fierce conversations about what to do, what not to do, who's Performing, who's not performing, and then really focus on executing really well. I would say we're perfect. This many times when we also make lots of mistakes. But that to me is one big thing. The second thing I've learned is in the B2B business, I find a lot of founders and CEOs focus a lot on the product side of the house, which makes sense because they typically are technical Founders, and they're very, very focused around like if I build a great product, it will come. But the reality is that, and part of the way I grew up was that I grew up early in my career when the best technology didn't always win. You had large vendors like IBM and HP and others who had so much account control that even if you had a better mouse trap, the customer would always pick the safe decision, which was to Go in large organization. And so I realized that not only do you have to build a greater product, but you also have to build a ferocious go-to-market organization. And in those days, it's all about sales, but now go-to-market has become much more sophisticated with sales and PLG and so on and so forth. But to me, the magic happens when you can marry a great product with a great go-to-market organization. And that's where you can really differentiate yourself in the industry. And for example, at BlayLogic, my last company, we had such a great sales force that I think about 35 people out of that sales organization became CROs of seminal software companies In our industry. I don't think another company has ever had that kind of track record. And so as much thought as we put into our product and how we position our products, and I'm not saying products are not important, in fact, it's very important. You don't have business, you don't have a great product, but that's necessary, but not sufficient in building a B2B business. You need to be just as thoughtful about how you go to market.

    - **Note:** Most people are afraid of making the decisions they need to be successful which leads to many average companies. Don’t fold under the pressure of hard decisions. Databases underly everything mongo made databases more ui friendly. Oracle still has lock in because switching providers is impossible. Build great product and go to market. Recruit and develop hungry people. Hates passive aggressive behavior. Raising little capital creates the ability to not kick the can down the road and forces action constantly with problems. Don’t delay on problems. If you see a problem and don’t act on it you’re the problem not everyone scaled at the same rate and you need to be flexible. Problems are solved by inspection and constant monitoring not expectations. Constant inspection shines light on things to see problems quicker. Bad news travels slow and must be acted upon quickly. High on inspection attacks problems quickly go after negatives.
      Make hard decisions with fear database lock in. Critical mass of smart people. Take action don’t delay. Inspection of problems.
- Keys to Building a High-Performing Sales Force
  Summary:
  Designing and architecting a high-performing sales force starts with recruiting hungry, intelligent individuals, developing them in various aspects of selling.
  Organizations should focus on recruiting, developing, and consistently executing to ensure high performance. Forecasting accurately is important in high-growth businesses to prevent cash burn.
  Managing longer sales cycles needs understanding customer pain points, demonstrating why the product is the best solution and creating a sense of urgency.
  The sales process should address three core questions: why the customer wants to act, why the product is the best choice, and why the decision needs to be made now.
  Interim steps involve qualifying the buyer's budget, understanding priorities, and influencing decision criteria. Building champions who advocate for your product is vital, as they have the power and influence to drive decisions in your favor.

  Speaker 1
  I would say a couple things. One, obviously, starts with a leader in terms of how they've designed and architected the sales force. One sign of how good a sales force is is broad-based performance. You can always have one person who's knocking it out of the park, but you don't want the 80-20 rule where 20% of the reps are killing it 80% or not, because obviously that doesn't create A great culture and a great environment. So you want to create an environment where people are performing well. So that's an output. So then what are the inputs to drive that output? So to me, the best organizations are very good at recruiting. They're very good at recruiting hungry people who are very smart and who really want to make a mark. The second thing they're really good at is developing those people. Just because you recruit someone doesn't mean that they're going to be great. How do you develop them, not just on product skills, but how to prosecute a deal, how to qualify an opportunity, how to assess where you are in the decision process and the sales process, And what potential risks there are in closing that deal, how to forecast well. One of the things in the high growth business is your revenue forecast or your bookings forecast is a proxy for your expense forecast. So if you don't forecast well, you can burn through a lot of cash very, very quickly. So those are the small marks to me of a great sales realization and then obviously consistency in terms of execution. They're not like a yo-yo, one quarter of the great, one quarter of the hair and hot. They're consistently delivering their numbers. So if you have those attributes, then that means you're doing something special. And it becomes even harder in a high growth business because not only are you trying to make the number, but you're planning for where the business is going to be two, three quarters out. So you're trying to recruit people because you have to assume roughly a six month ramp for someone to become productive. So how you think about territory planning, how you making sure that the new people join the organization are set up for success and the old guys or gals don't have all the best accounts So that new people are kind of starving for good accounts. There's a whole process around making sure that you're sending your team up for success. How do you think about like one of the things we do is like sell divisions. So once you get to a certain number of reps per manager, you divide and promote or hire another manager and so on and so forth. And how do you do that? And who's the right manager to lead that organization, etc. Are all things that we spend a lot of time on.
  Speaker 2
  What have you learned and this is a selfish question from just a current experience looking at some enterprise companies that have naturally very long sales cycles just based on the Nature of the customer and the buyer and how they work. It's going to be hard to change that. What have you learned about sales cycles, especially if they're longer ones and how to think about and manage those things, especially when the juice is worth the squeeze, it's millions Of dollars per customer or something like that. Yeah, what have you learned about that kind of motion that's not just a demo and a sale?
  Speaker 1
  I hate deals where it's just a very long sale cycle because there's always a chance for something going wrong. But if you think about any sales process, any sales process is essentially designed to address three core questions. Why does the customer want to do anything? I.e. What pain or prom do they have that's going to force them to take action. So that's with the discovery part of the sales process. You try and discover what pain or prom customers have that are relevant to what you can solve for. The second phase of that is why MongoDB. Why is MongoDB the best choice to solve that pain relative to all the alternatives and substitutes available. And then the third part of the sales process is why now. Because you can do the first two things, but the customer can easily kick the can down the road. And in many cases, that's the struggle most sales people have. It's not that you lose a deal, but the customer never makes a decision. Can you create a manufacturer or is there a compelling event you can use to force a customer or induce a customer to make a decision sooner than later? So those three questions, I don't know how you can forecast a deal if you don't have answers to those three questions. So that's essentially how our sales process is broken down. Then the certain interim steps in the sales process that tell you, are you on track to kind of getting a deal? Have you met with the economic buyer? Have you qualified how much budget is available? Have you qualified even that this is a priority for them? And because you're not just competing with your own competitor, you're competing with other vendors and other spaces for budget dollars. And so how do you know is this prom that you're solving for as important as another prom that another vendor might be trying to address? And then obviously, what is the decision criteria? One rule of thumb we have is you should never end the answering RFP. Because invariably, if you're getting an RFP that you've never worked on before, some other vendor has written the RFP. So what that means is you have to set the table on the decision criteria. How is a customer going to make a decision? What features or capabilities are they going to weigh and how are they going to wait then relative to other things they can consider for them to make a decision? Have you educated the customer and built what we call champions who will understand the value of MongoDB and understand why for their own business, MongoDB is the best choice. And then building a champion, a champion, you define as someone who's selling for you when you let the building. You obviously someone who's a change agent has power and influence an organization and is really selling for you after you're not there. There's a big difference what we call between champions and coaches. Coaches want to see when but they're not going to take either any personal risks themselves or they just don't have the credibility or juice to kind of influence the decision. But they can be helpful to kind of give you some insight or radar into what's happening to count. But ultimately, there's a champion for every deal that I close. Sometimes you may not know who your champion is, but there's someone who's advocating for you when you're not alone in the room or advocating frankly for someone else. And you will got to make sure your champion is more powerful than your enemy's champion. And that's all part of the sales process.

- Understanding the underlying psyche in recruiting
  Summary:
  Recruiting should focus on understanding what motivates and drives a person, delving into their upbringing, values, work ethic, and long-term orientation.
  Assessing a candidate's psychological attributes, such as managing grit, ego, and comfort with low status, is crucial for long-term success in a role. Recognizing what truly motivates a person and understanding their underlying psyche is essential to ensuring they are the right fit for the business.

  Speaker 2
  Can you explain your philosophy of recruiting? It sounds like that is a key thing that you've always focused on in your businesses, and I noticed at Mongo2. What do you think is the most important part of how you think about getting the right people into the business? Anything that you've done that you feel is especially impactful?
  Speaker 1
  I think one of the things about recruiting, most people make the common mistake of just focusing on what the person's background experiences, where they work, what skills they had, And maybe what successes that they can talk about. I think a big part of recruiting is trying to figure out what makes a person tick. What is it about them? What is it about their upbringing? What drives them? What motivates them in terms of who they are and where they want to go and what they want to be? I think if you don't really understand that underlying psyche of the person, how do you know what you're really getting? It's one thing to say, hey, do you have experience building product? Do you experience selling enterprise software? How do you assess someone's values? Do you believe in the value of hard work? How do you measure grit? One of your common guests that I love made a statement that I completely agreed with was Jeremy Giffon, who talked about that the only enduring edge in life is psychological as human Nature doesn't change. That was like words out of my mouth. How you manage grit, how you manage your ego, are you comfortable with low status? Are you comfortable being unconventional? Can you delay gratification? Do you have long-term orientation? Those are keys to being really successful, but it's so hard to do because it's so contrary to human nature. How do you find someone who can really do those things and what drives them to do those things? I've heard some amazing stories about people. I asked them the question, what's the most difficult thing you've ever endured? I keep it generally open-ended. Some of the stories you hear about what they had to deal with in their upbringing, they were came from broken home or they came with very few resources and they're so driven about making ([Time 0:37:21](https://share.snipd.com/snip/feec9d23-0487-427e-80b1-a775eb9a6c34))
    - **Note:** In recruiting understand what makes someone tick and their psychological tendencies that make them who they are. Don’t asses someone’s background but their values. The only long term edge is psychological. Importance of having great mentors to help guide you. Having a good mentor where you can be safe to lay out your problems full open kimono is vital investors you can’t always have that. Any leader has to be open minded to problems in a big market. Success of a product is if a customer comes back to buy more. Make it easy to close people and then scale relationships leader should be self-aware know how to recruit and hold people accountable help leaders develop these skills scale middle management. Accountability be clear on expectations, when someone misses an expectation, the leader takes responsibility before blaming the person make it very clear why it’s important, 3 then if happens again, and you can hold them accountable because you’ve made the problem clear. Need to hold people accountable in a fair way. People have the skills and will to do the job that’s the matrix for making success happen. Don’t ignore bad news. You can judge leaders by the people who work for them bs hire cs. Keep as hiring as. Development changes with your peer group when you work with better smarter people you approve exponentially faster.
