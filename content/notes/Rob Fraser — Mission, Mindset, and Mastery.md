### Highlights

- Embrace Failure as a Catalyst for Growth
  Summary:
  Competitive sports serve as a significant training ground for business and life by instilling the values of hard work, resilience, and adaptability.
  Success in sports often comes from substantial preparation, as illustrated by the contrast between merely reaching the starting line of a marathon and the necessity of training for it. The experience of frequently facing failure in sports develops a mindset focused on building resilience; athletes often win only a fraction of the time, emphasizing the importance of learning from setbacks and effectively dealing with injuries.
  Furthermore, managing one's career in sports involves critical skills like negotiation, networking, and logistics.
  Through exposure to diverse challenges, athletes learn to think creatively, communicate effectively, and leverage their experiences to navigate obstacles.
  Ultimately, the core lesson is that achievements are earned through effort and that unpredictability is part of the journey, reinforcing the necessity of preparing for unexpected challenges in both sports and business. This athlete-driven perspective prioritizes practical learning and personal growth over book knowledge, demonstrating that the mindset cultivated in sports can profoundly influence one's approach to business and life.

  Speaker 2
  Last night, you told me that competitive sports is better than business school. Talk to me about that as a training ground for business. Yeah.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah. I think for life as well, honestly. I think, you know, what does sport teach you? Ultimately, sport will teach you that you have to put in the work. If we use running as an example, you can't just show up and run a marathon, right? You can get to the start line. Anyone can go to the start line, but it's going to be pretty clear who prepared and who didn't. But beyond that competitive sport, at least in my experience, you know, as competitive cyclists, I was five times on the national team for about 10 years, traveled around the world Racing my bike. And what that taught me was a bunch of things, most importantly, failure and resilience. Like, like, how do you ever like we would race, maybe, let's say, 10 times a year, and maybe win once or twice. So you're failing more than you succeed. And it's how are you dealing with that and building forward? And how are you dealing with injuries? But more than that, it's how are you networking yourself? So I managed myself as well. So I was negotiating my sponsorship contracts. I was booking worldwide logistics. I remember when I was 16 in high school, I was named to my first national team and I got an email. So I had just won a national race and that named me the team that year. I didn't even know what world championships was. I was so green in the sport, so new to the sport. And I got an email from the national federation. It's like, Hey, you've been named to the world championships team it's in Italy next month like we'd love for you to come and I remember emailing back and being like no I can't I have school And because I had no idea I was so green and then I showed the email to my parents they're like what did you do like email them back like you're gonna go we'll talk to the school we'll get you Out and like we'll support you to go and so I emailed them back I got on the team. And what that led into is like, it was going to Italy. So hop on a plane, arrive in Germany for a layover, having no idea where I am and just being kind of thrown into the deep end like that. Like as a young kid, just hop on a plane, you end up in Europe. I didn't even really know where Europe is at that time. Embarrassingly, if you said point out Italy on a map, I would have had a tough time. And so that's like how kind of, just, but now I'm there and how do you deal with that? And how do you meet new people? And then how do you perform all of these lessons? And we talked about earlier about building a resilient mindset and how do you learn to kind of just push forward when things get tough and sport will teach you that. And, you know, business school, I think is important. I don't want to knock on it too bad, but they're teaching you, you know, all the things you can read about and learn about, right? So all the tactics and kind of just the common knowledge and how you would apply that. But I think ultimately in business, at least what I've learned is like you could know everything, but it's how are you going to react when shit hits the fan, right? And how are you going to talk to people and negotiate and use your network and kind of think creatively? And those were a lot of the lessons that I learned in sport is like, how do you use some of your past experiences to your advantage? Like having the network I did was so incredible. And I just think that sport, if I boil it all down to like a distinct answer, it's really that it taught me that everything is earned, not owed. You had to do the work. There was no substitute for the work that things almost never go to plan and you need to figure it out. And then just built so many skills of performing under pressure, you know, talking to people. It's just, it just, you're immersed in it and there's no getting out of it. And I just thought that was such a formative experience. You know, everything we'll talk about today and everything I've done in business has been on the back of the sporting career. I didn't go to business school. Of course, I've read all the books and I've tried to learn the common knowledge and I have, but the lessons and the actual mindset I take to business for almost the last 10 years is the same Mindset I had when I was competing in sport.
  Speaker 2
  Talk to me a little more about the role of sort of preparation or positioning when it comes to sport and business. Seems like there's a lot of similarities between the two in that.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah. ([Time 0:10:24](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2c0d2f3b-2442-44eb-92d3-68ad4ff7d5cf))
    - **Note:** Failure can either hold you back or push you forward. Failure and resilience. Become thankful for failure. How are you dealing with failure and networking. You can learn everything but how do you behave when shit hits the fan is what you need. Everything is earned you must live in pressure. Focused on preparation and positioning. How can you put yourself in a position to suceed. Take risk be resilient. Prepare to be ready when it matters. All the set up you do is what puts you in position to be successful by the time of the event it’s an inevitability based on past work. There are no shortcuts it’s hard work and tough times always. broke his wrist and didn’t want to miss races so he tapped it to his bike and gritted the pain we’re more powerful than we realize. Excellence is the capacity to take pain. When he finished his career he was lost he tried to go into sports management but felt empty inside and hated it needed to carve his own path. He started with a partner they had a values difference that took awhile for them to figure out and you need to be clear about your values before doing anything.
- Commitment Cultivates Growth
  Summary:
  In entrepreneurship, commitment is crucial for growth and success.
  The initial stages challenge founders to balance fun and serious business implications, often leading to conflicts if values and goals aren't aligned from the start. A clear vision and alignment with partners can prevent misunderstandings and exits.
  Personal investment, including taking financial risks, signifies deep commitment and belief in the venture.
  Support and encouragement from loved ones, especially in critical moments, bolster confidence and determination to succeed.
  Building a network of like-minded individuals fosters encouragement and insight, vital for personal and professional development. However, founders must also navigate potential pitfalls within these relationships, ensuring mutual support and shared goals for effective collaboration.

  Speaker 1
  You know, in the first year we did, you know, multi six figure revenue of just selling socks kind of around town for the most part. The first socks I sold, I just took to school and Tupperware and hand to hand combat and sold them to students, teachers, basically like, you know, not friends if you don't buy these. And so that was how it got started. And so ultimately after a year, it started to get real. The work required nights and weekends is the common stories go. And it became pretty clear that this was out of line with his values. We didn't have those discussions early on of like, what do we want out of this? Because we were doing it for fun. We were friends. We just wanted to have a good time and try something and really kill time and during school. We always expected just to continue with school and kind of continue on. But that for me evolved very quickly into like, oh no, I can do this. I really like this and there's a big opportunity here. And so ultimately over time, that started to grow and the gap between our abilities to have conversations of what's going on, because I was just like consuming knowledge and trying To learn at such a rate because I was obsessed with it. It became very difficult for us to be aligned on what we wanted out of the business, which ultimately led to him leaving the business and quitting. True to form, we didn't have any proper resolution for that. We didn't have a shareholders agreement. We didn't like, just did almost everything wrong when setting up the company, which is really easy to do because there's almost no great resources for helping an entrepreneur. And ultimately, to get the proper legal agreements is expensive. We started the business with $1,000 each, right? So put $1,000 in. That's all we had. And it all went in inventory. There was no money for a legal agreement or a lawyer. And you're in the honeymoon phase of business. Of course, you're never going to fight with your partner, right? Everything's great. It's going to be successful. But once it gets real, that's when those kind of things are super important to have at least a discussion about. And there was no discussion. And so he left the business. There was no resolution. And that kind of led into this period of where I had to figure figure out how to resolve that. And it was super messy and ultimately ended up coming to an arrangement and buying them out. It ended up kind of closing two, two and a half years into the business. And kind of March of 2019 is when he officially left the business and I got full control. And that's kind of what I peg is like the real start. That's where I was like, I'm all in because I had to go take out a personal loan to make it happen of like $150,000, which was insane. I remember we finally agreed on a number and I didn't have that money. I had student debt. I had the exact opposite of money in the bank, but I was so committed around that. We talked about earlier around just the mindset and the willingness to kind of just go all in. I went to every bank in town and I was like, okay, I've got credit cards I'll draw out on. I've got a line of credit. I've got some student loans. My then girlfriend, now wife, she was like, I'll sign on, we'll get some loans. And I was able to kind of put the money together through all these various, very high interest, high risk kind of funding sources. Because I didn't want to ask anyone. I was like, I believe in this, but I don't want to put anyone else at risk. I'm willing to take this on and put it on my shoulders and go. And the act of doing that, actually, my now father-in reached out after. He's like, hey, look, I appreciate that you were willing to do this, but I'll loan you the money. And I'm forever grateful for that because A, it was a vote of confidence and it was, it just, it, it allowed me to kind of, you know, push on. And I was super proud to be able to pay him back in a couple of years too. We paid him out like relatively quickly and the terms are super fair anyways, but it's like, I want to get his money back. And I take that responsibility incredibly seriously. Otherwise there's Christmas dinner is going to be pretty awkward. Yeah, yeah, of course. But I had such high conviction that I would do anything to get that money back. If the business wasn't going to fail, that money would go back first. And I take those sorts of things. When people bet on me or my employees or investors, whatever, I take that incredibly seriously. The number one thing you should be focused on is doing right by the people that believe in you and bet on you.
  Speaker 2
  Who was the first person that ever bet on you?
  Speaker 1
  My mom. Yeah. So I went to university and dropped out. So that was a big riff in our family because going to university was the safe path. That was the known path of my dad sold insurance and my mom, when she had us, stayed at home. And it was super traditional, super go to school, get whatever job, build a family. And so the idea of kind of going all in on this cycling career at the time was just like a pipe dream for the most part. And it wasn't really anything yet was a big riff. But my mom, I could tell deep down, she was like, I know you got this. I know you'll figure it out. Because what I would always say to my parents at the time, and I was telling you about this yesterday, is like, whenever I have these big goals, I kind of hold two beliefs at the same time. One belief is, I'm absolutely sure I'll pull this off. Like, I have no doubt I will figure this out. But I have no idea how I'm going to do it. I could not articulate that, which is very difficult for a parent because they're like, I want to believe you, but I need to see some pathway. What's the plan, dude? Yeah. It ended up working out. And it was the same thing in business too. It's like, I have no idea how I'm going to do this, but I do know I can do it and it's going to work out. My mom being like, you know, kind of just on the side, you know, being like, I know you'll figure it out. That was, you know, so important. She's always kind of been in my corner like that. And certainly the person to kind of bet on me and understand I was different. You know, she understood that like I was intensely passionate about things as a kid. And I don't think also she really had a frame for entrepreneurship, like because it just wasn't a discussion. Like I had all these little things going. I had my own little my own little bike shop repair. I built an office in my bedroom closet. I was always doing these. I just didn't know what it was. I was obsessed with the idea of kind of building business. I built bike teams. I would get all the kids in there, but we built teams. I was organizing people. We had like schedules. And so I was always building teams, leading teams, building little businesses. And I just didn't know what I was doing was entrepreneurship or building a business. That was just what came natural to me and what I loved to do. And so she knew I was different. So she knew when I was kind of going to go on a different path. She encouraged that, which I'm forever thankful for because it's hard to be the only one that believes in yourself sometimes.
