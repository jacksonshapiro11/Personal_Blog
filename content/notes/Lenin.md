### Highlights

- Lenin had previously been in great health always going to the mountains to relax combinded with fits of very hard work. Now he was not making those mountain trips eating worse and his mental health and outbursts as well as his physical health was firmly in decline. Previous the man who had always been healthy got his health mentally and physically caught in a negative compounding cycle. Take breaks mentally and physically. Lenin had a cult of personality that he didn’t embrace nor fully reject. Lenin started to allow free trade an enterprise which led to things like butter being restocked in stores he also derided the communist bureaucracy as 90% were party men who just were red tape so he aimed to reduce red tape enable free enterprise but keep the communist values. Getting foreign money was very hard because the soviets allowed small enterprises but not big ones which remained state controlled. Lenin pushed this through despite a lot of resistance. Late in life Lenin had a stroke wanted to commit suicide but Stalin and Nadia wouldn’t let him. He was extremely weak at this time with many jockeying for power behind him namely Stalin and trotsky. He made laws that would be used against people often in this time. Lenin created the monster that was Stalin and was to blame for his cruel nature.

    - **Note:** Lenin always took breaks physical and mental to recoup and heal you need a balanced life avoid negative compounding and burnout.
      Lenin realized the concentration of power that was communism lead to power vacuums and started to advocate for free enterprise. Most people in the movement wanted power and conditions didn’t change just rulers.
- Lenin sent more money overseas to continue communism than he put toward ending famine i Russia. Lenin would kill anyone who went against him including war heros who turned against him. Prisoners were executed in mass constantly. Better to let 100 innocent die than 1 revolutionary run free. Ruled by unrestrained power and use of force over law. Would sometimes pardon individuals. There was mass starvation the siezing of grain led to no stocks being built up so the farmers grew less knowing it’d be taken and couldn’t be stored. When there was finally a tough winter nothing could be done and many starved 25% of peasants. He denied the famine was happening and banned the word in the press even tried to suppress aid. Rebellions we’re brutally crushed and cracked down strongly on the church. Lenin looted the churches. They used the famine as the excuse to tear apart the church and stole their valuables killing priests.

    - **Note:** Lenin put the mission above all else and was willing to kill anyone and everyone to be successful. This is a sick twisted version of missionary over mercenary control the narrative and issues with communism. process didn’t matter just the outcome.
- Lenin knew how to appoint the right leaders so while he wasn’t a great military mind he had a good military org and knew how to manage his strengths and people. Usually hands off when he didn’t understand. The whites wanted to bring back the past which the people really didn’t want and were very disorganized in their leadership so never had a great fight. Trotsky hired the czar military people because the existing army was a rag tag group and they needed to experience people didn’t like this but it was the right decision. They were ruthless willing to shoot deserters and the us supported the whites in this war. The west never gave enough support to the whites what if of history. Trotsky and Stalin didn’t get along. The whites were losing and started brutally killing Jews. The intelegencia fled the country the whites gave up and Lenin became russias first red czar.

    - **Note:** Lenin was good at understanding his circle of competence and judging others he was great at identifying men who would lead the party going forward and do it well. He listened to others when he didn’t know. Good manager of men didn’t care about them though.
      Lenin just cared about the outcome the ends justified any means to him. Put the right people in the right positions
- There was a murder attempt of Lenin but he survived. This led to an orgy of retribution and violence. Red terror on a grand scale. They just started executing prisoners in mass for no reason. This led to the cult of personality that formed around communist figures in power. Lenin became a godlike person. He was the backbone of the body politic. Lenin lived very modestylt. The communists became the leading class and took advantage of others Lenin didn’t like it but didn’t do much to stop it. Despite people dying the Bolsheviks are very well and had lavish party’s curroption. Lenin could slight and be very good humored. People in the party stopped speaking up to maintain their rank instead of being revolutionaries they became career politicians. Lenin read for function not for pleasure and was not as well read as others like Stalin who were extremely well read. He didn’t have much of an appreciation for the arts either. He hates futurism and abstract art. Like simple realist art. Lenin lead to the great censorship of art and flight of many artists.

    - **Note:** This is the turning of the revolution when Lennon almost gets assassinated. Then it turns into power games people are trying to change. They’re just trying to grab power and people are killed in discriminately. Lennon had no appreciation for the arts and he pretty much outlawed them. this is pure, grabbing power, not helping others or being a revolutionary. Revolutionaries just grabbed. Howard won tower and get corrupted power corrupts.
- Lenin held free elections but they didn’t go their way only winning 24% so they started suppressing it and eventually threw the winning party in jail. Lenin dissolved the assembly thinking the people wouldn’t care only the intelligencia. He was right no one cared. The Bolsheviks turned the rich into poor taking their houses and giving them to poor people and giving them less rations than workers leading some to starve to death. The Russians moved the capital to Moscow from St. Petersburg to be safer but like it so adopted it. There was utter chaos in this time that Lenin supported. There was a horrible famine and inflation many starved Lenin blamed the rich farmers a class he invented. But famine was very bad. He declared war on the farmers paying them well below market for the food and killing those who didn’t cooperate. There were counter uprising that were put down then Lenin quietly and in silent ordered the killing of the czar. The execution was pretty badly done and hidden from the international community for fear of retribution

    - **Note:** Lenin just wanted power and tried to do it the right way but realized he couldn’t and so just took it. He created enemies that fit his narrative dissolved and killed dissidents and created huge famine killing anyone who spoke out. He siezed all the rich people’s money and took it for himself no one else cared. Great example of power dynamics shifting. Controlling the flow of information and power in the real world
- The makeshift government was chaos no one was really in charge or knew what was going on it was like they were still running the revolution only now they were in charge. Lenin wrote many decrees at this time and took central power people who were pretty unqualified were appointed there was no strange hold power was touch and go so he needed Allies. The kgb original organization was founded governed under Lenin with a hardened leader who was ruthless and had been an abused revolutionary it was the most feared organization in Russia. Bershinsky was scared physically from his time in the czars prisons but was very honest and values alligned with Lenin. Did anything for the revolution they basically had a blank check on executions and Lenin’s full support and protection became a state within the state. The Russians tried to negotiate for peace and had no fighting force they dragged their feet and got a much worse boarder line embarrassment of a deal. No one wanted to sign it but they had no choice.

    - **Note:** When the revolution actually won, everyone was a bit confused and lost. They didn’t have a next plan and Lenin needed allies in the government to run it properly overall pretty clueless and ended up executing a lot of people. The fear of losing power led to a lot of the executions.
      Importance of system, thinking planning allies and revolution
- Government was printing money like crazy the people in charge were so lost no direction. This was probably Lenin’s last shot in life to grab power. The Bolsheviks were happy to talk and not do revolution but Lenin pushed them into revolution driving force great people of history. Lenin came back to the city to stir his coup. The meeting was a minority of a minority making this happen Lenin was demanding action. Karensky doubted the Bolsheviks and underestimated them. They didn’t believe they could lose. Lenin was obsessed with grabbing and keeping power. Lenin deeply feared he’d lose power he didn’t need money or women but had a deep lust for power and keeping it. He ruled by terror and censorship and firing squad. Lenin took control and complete lacked morality and power. They needed money and so they robbed the bank. After coming to power.

    - **Note:** Lenin saw his last shot in his life to grab what he wanted more than anything else power. He rallied a minority and the government was so weak he was able to grasp power. Great person theory of history. He did whatever he needed to get things done.
- Lenin promised very simple answers to very complex problems. He just said what he needed to to make people happy. He spoke like a college professor at rally’s but what he said drove people crazy with glee. The government was structured such that Lenin/ the soviets had control over the military. There was bloody revolution in the streets constantly. The German socialists heavily funded the Bolshevik’s. After coming to power they destroyed all the paper trail. Lenins competition was extremely weak. The Russian army stopped fighting. Lenin was exhausted and took a break the July days were near insurrection and fairly violent. Lenin was unhappy with this as he felt the Bolshevik’s were in a place to take over and wasn’t even there to see it. He fan back to calm people down. Lenin was angry wiry this and called off the demonstrations but the party were so confused on what the line was. The reorganized the cause. This lead to the formation of the red guards. They needed we plan for an overthrow. This forced Lenin underground they went out to arrest Lenin. He fled as he was the key to the revolution and may have been killed if found out. He was on the run for 3 months. This is when they planned the the revolution and Lenin fled deep into findland. Karinskys issue was he was very vain and acted like the czar in status not in action though.
- The Germans helped Lenin get back to Russia during the war to start the revolution to hope to destabilize Russia and win the war. Lenin enemy of my enemy is my friend. Lenin didn’t care about morals just getting things done. They left on a sealed train of German soldiers. Lenin was incredibly difficult and nervous during this journey and was horribly despotic many nations let them continue to pass until they had reached Russia again. Thousands showed up to welcome Lenin back and the first thing he did was yell at a lieutenant. Lenin didn’t sleep for 2 days before arrival did not compromise but declared full Soviet take over. He wanted to tear down the government nationalize the banks and restart a socialist state from the ground up. The opposition saw his extremism as beneficial to them thinking it to radical never underestimate your opponent. There was violence throughout the country with no government unity. Karensky who was well liked by everyone came to power Lenin realized although he had helped his family he was his greatest threat and sought to tear him down.

    - **Note:** The enemy of my enemy is my friend the Germans helped Lenin even though they were at war with Russia. This train journey is legendary and Lenin was focused on getting things done and didn’t handle intense stress well. He sought to dismantle opposition by any means necessary
      Both the Germans and Russians thought Lenin’s extremism was too crazy they underestimated his drive to be successful never underestimate your opposition. Mental health and handling stress.
- The Russian upper classes were having a renaissance type explosion but at the same time inflation was out of control the price of bread was 500% higher medicine was 100x the poor couldn’t afford to live. This was the start of the revolution. The Russians had lost or deserted 5mm soldiers in war. The rich lived in excess opulence while the poor barely got by. Soldiers were disalusiomed and poorly treated crammed 4K men into 1k barracks this was the breeding ground for the Bolshevik’s. Everyone from the government to the people to the soldiers wanted revolution things had gotten so bad it was openly talked about in the press. Then in the press it was clear Russia had revolted military took control. Lenin didn’t foresee this but understood it was his moment. He made a claim to power he wouldn’t align with any other parties and held his line against a lot of pushback but he was right this was his moment and these next few months of revolution would be critical. Lenin was desperate to get back to Russia. The czar was at the front when the food ran out and bloody riots started. The czar was too stupid to see what was happening and paid no bother the army didn’t help they were pissed too and Russian government fell. The czar abdicated and the romanovs were dead.

    - **Note:** The anatomy of a revolution the classes were separating the army was lost there was no grip on power but there was awareness of the situation by all and pretty much everyone was talking out loud about revolution. Lenin saw this as hit moment and the czar was too stupid to realize anything was even wrong. This czar wasnt even ignorant of his ignorance.
- War breaks out and Lenin is imprisoned as a Russia spy. He is released after help from the Austrian government going to war was the nail in the czars coffin. The was was such a disaster the Russians had more men then guns and lost all their trained soldiers after a few months. The untrained soldiers deserted in mass with 16 deserters for every one death vs the British who had 1 for every 5 deaths. Lenin was anti war didn’t care how many workers lives were lost. Lenin was a defeatist he wanted Russia to lose so he could grab power from a weak czar and bring peace to Russia. In 1917 Lenin was pretty much broke the revolution had fallen apart and was out of luck.

    - **Note:** The czar was an incompetent leader who had lost the people so the conditions were right but Lenin and the revolution was at its weakest point ever and was very much uphill from here dark moment where all could’ve been lost. These near death moments in every movement.
- Lenin changed the theory when his goals changed. He wasn’t tied to the Marxist rules. Malinowski was the top Bolshevik and was put in parliament as part of Lenin’s plan to embrace democracy to win more members. The issue was he was a greedy double agent but Lenin liked him too much to see this. He was the most important Russian spy at this time. As part of this democracy plot they get to write a paper they call proof or Pravda it’s the most famous in Russia goes for 100+ editions and many key editors get jailed. With the paper getting big Lenin moved to krakow to be close to the Russia boarder. He also let Inesa speak for him at party events. This was a big deal because Lenin trusted no one but soon Inesa and him split up for Nadia’s mental health.

    - **Note:** Lennon would change his minds when it fit him. This is a point where there’s a struggle for control of the party and there’s also a struggle for the party to go mainstream. It’s kind of the middle point in Lennon hero journey. Only trusted a few people did what he had. Landen used newspaper to control the narrative and market his ideas.
- Lenin did everything for money including approving bank robberies and extorting heiresses through marriage the ends justified the means even getting money from capitalists. Lenin was in a fight for the party against the menchivicks and while living a simple life he always had food and money to travel. Lenin while a politician could snooze with the best of them. The communist party was being crushed by the czar but Lenin did not want to give in and partner with the Mensheviks he needed power. There were so many informants the movement was basically dead everyone was arrested no one came in or out. Russia secret police were in very deep with the movement. Inesa armond became Lenin’s side chick she was a revolutionary who adored the man. Inesa was middle class turned revolutionary as a mother of 4 cheated on her husband who would continue to support and love her and was thrown to prison in Russia. She needed life purpose. Lenin moved to Paris but generally didn’t like it but met his mistress there. Most people including Nadia were ok and embraced the love triangle. Nadia may have seen this acceptance as a part she played in the revolution.

    - **Note:** Lenin had a very interesting love triangle. He always believed the ends justified the means. He had a deep desire for control and power and played politics. His organization was very infiltrated. Some people need people to give them a life purpose. Revolution was nearly dead keep the faith. Lenin lived a simple life and loved power.
- The czar Nicholas who was killed with his family was viewed as a simpleton who got everything that was coming to him he was completely incompetent and every decision he made was very wrong. The revolution started after the czar told the army to react with force towards a peaceful protest. They appealed to him and believed in him to help pay fair wages and modernize the government but he turned the cavalry after them and shot them in the street it was the end of his reign and proved his incompetence justifying his family murder. Had he been a better ruler maybe the revolution wouldn’t have happened he ignited it. The myth of the good czar was dead and the international journalist on scene spread news fast. Bloody Sunday threw Lenin the armchair general into action while history would say they were at the center of this very few were even in attendance. Lenin started coming back to Russia the czar grip only got tighter and he started blaming and killing people throughout Russia especially Jews. Lenin would start speaking publicly more but his cowardice was shown many times running from protests to preserve his safety.

    - **Note:** The czar was an incompetent ruler who didn’t understand the people and he created the initial conditions for revolution and ignited it. Weak rulers creating bad times. Lenin was a coward but did so to stay alive. Czar was a weak man who lost the trust of the people. Reputation lost in a day and controlling the narrative.
- There was a schism in the party between the Bolshevik’s and Leninis that lasted for the life of the revolution. Lenin used his political cunning to come up with bad names for the other side and declare himself the majority when he clearly wasn’t. This schism led Lenin to take personal shots at his opponents and this was the underhanded trump like tactics he pioneered. He would work relentlessly and I would cause fits of health issues this schism. He was not worried on keeping the small party together he was ok with the split because he only wanted the most committed and ardent supporters. He was burnt out and took a 1 month vacation trampling around in the mountains. This restored his vitality.
    - **Tags:** #lenin, #genie-vs-gollum, #rest-and-recover, #personal-attacks, #zealot-(unwilling-to-change), #dogma-(resist-it)
    - **Note:** Lenin wanted power and would use personal attacks to get it. He also overworked himself and would take month long breaks. He wanted zealots and made everyone the enemy.
- What is to be done was a great socialist work that Lenin wanted to organize the party around 100 great revolutionaries than 1000 fools. This was the text of the revolution. Lenin when writing something quickly could dash it off but when he was writing something important he’d often reason things out for himself a few times before writing and use Nadia’s counsel constantly. Lenin would talk to himself constantly thinking through every chapter of the book then repeating it and talking through it with Nadia before he wrote it.

    - **Note:** Lenin’s writing was a lot of thinking writing rewriting getting counsel. Iterating and working at it. Thoughtful reflection
- Lenin moved to London where exhiles generally went to seek freedom and were protected. Lenin needed alone time and would rather think and work than drink and debate topics he had already made his mind up on. Here he was able to print iskra and read from one of the best libraries in the world that Marx had also used. Lenin still enjoyed the country and exploring England he visited working class plays. Here he met Trotsky and they became great friends. Trotsky was an equal intellectually and also as strong headed as Lenin.
    - **Tags:** #avoid-distraction, #lenin, #focus, #enviornment-influences-behavior
    - **Note:** Lenin wanted to get away and focus on what was important he had already made his mind up on key issues and now it was just about action.
- These revolutionaries had nothing but the revolution it meant they could be something bigger than a worker a part of a bigger movement this is what raised their commitment above everything including family and spouses they could have no friends but the revolution often living on hand outs but that’s the life they chose rather than the worker. Lenin was oft criticized for not putting himself at risk like the other workers but justified this through his previous imprisonment. They spoke in codes and code names which Nadia Lenin’s wife. The police usually broke their simple codes quickly and Lenin would get angry for the lack or slow progress having no sympathy for the risks his workers took.
- Lenin used many fake names for Vladimir illicic his real name but for one reason or another Lenin stuck. He after exhile wasn’t allowed in the capital he would make formal asks if those in control to get an exemption when they weren’t granted he went anyways. He didn’t believe in listening to authority and did ultimately what he wanted. He was constantly avoiding and sometimes caught by the secret police in doing this. He had to apply to leave Russia at that time and he was granted to go to Germany there he worked for 5 years as a socialist but this was a difficult time away from home. He was very lonely in this time. His wife met him in Europe and this is when the revolution started in 1901 and they started spreading a newspaper called iskra. They sought to fit all events in the wider soviet contextual lens. plekhanov was the most famous Russian revolutionary who had inspired Lenin. Lenin went to work with him on this project the catalyzed the Soviet movement but there was a power struggle between the two. plekhanov was Lenin’s hero but their struggle destroyed him don’t meet your hero’s he held him in esteem but they had different views and goals for the revolution this lead to heart break and schism. Lenin was lucky that there was no printing in Switzerland where plekhanov was or London so they needed to publish in Germany under his guidance. This gave him lucky control and from the first publishing he laid out all the steps for revolution and goals of the revolution that he then executed on. Smuggling the paper in was very difficult and many smugglers were arrest but only 10% actually got through and many people were imprisoned and killed for subversion and the target market was educated workers. Lenin was the chief editor and while very critical he would present ideas so that writers would think they discovered it themselves and they would print that. The circulation of the paper was low but the influence was high a single copy would be passed around many times and read aloud to illiterate people. Lenin was the brains martov was the heart and these men for a time were great friends only to have a falling out later leading to a scism in the party. He was a Jew and chaotic and eccentric where Lenin was controlled and conservative. He was a great writer but weak in action. There were many people in the party but Lenin was the unquestioned leader.

    - **Note:** Lenin left Russia never had much of a care for the law unsurprisingly and started iskra which basically fit all events within the communist framing and targeted the people as a way to grow the audience. He had to run away from home and start the movement and smuggle the newspaper in there was differing beliefs about the core movement but Lenin had the means of production controlled the message by allowing writers to understand his belief and implant those in their heads. He took charge of the situation
      Leaving was very risky and gritty but needed to be done. Don’t deceive yourself about what the game requires.
- Lenin was always running from the police and trying to hide his actions but he was arrested and sent to Siberia in the czar times political prisoners weren’t treated that poorly and was very unlike how the Soviet’s would treat their prisoners but this gave him the street cred to rise in the communist circles. Stamp of approval. I’m prison he stayed sharp physically and mentally. The prison security was really lax such that Lenin basically got banned materials all the time and wrote communications often with his conspirators. Mail and guests were allowed any time without much interrogation. He read a ton during this time. He convinces the authorities to send his future wife to Siberia claiming they were to be married. They spent exhile in Siberia together and in this time Lenin did a lot of reading and writing it was a very productive time in his life. They get married and their relationship while some would agree had little romance did seem at a deeper level to be more than meets the eye. They had a deep quiet love and affection that surpassed the common beliefs of theirs being a purely business arrangement. She did the chores and they were married Russian orthodox something’s the soviets but not them hid. They carved out a life there and the communist party was formed while he was there. While the party was formed without him he helped shape it in his image.

    - **Note:** Lenin got street cred from going to prison but the empire was such late stage and corrupt you could bribe your way anywhere that’s what Lenin did. This time in prison was his most productive and formed the communist party while he was in here. He spent a lot of quiet time in exhile with his wife which allowed him deep focus.
      Street cred = social proof. Communists control of the narrative.
- Lenin’s wife Nadia was a massive socialist as well as ardent and strong as he was. In the communist idea women were equal so long as they stood in line and didn’t have ideas once that came in they were second class. Lenin respected and listened to his wife. Lenin turned his opponents into insults and attacked them personally and with vitriol. He played the man not the ball and this defined communist debate from then on. He did this to win he was very polite with others and wanted to frustrate people so they’d leave the movement and he’d have more power. They played into his hands. He was very direct and clear in his point he would personally attack others then walk through his point but always first degrading then walking through his ideas. Very clear to the point. He loved the alps and being in nature.
- Lenin was expelled unluckily from school and was forced into self education in the country side at this time he read day and night forming the socialist he was to be the rest of his life. He molded Marx to Russian beliefs and made it especially cruel. He read the banned books his brother had and was forced into communism. Lenin’s mom did everything so he wouldn’t be radicalized and eventually he was able to get certified as a lawyer cramming 4 years of studying into 12 months and passing top of his class. This shows both genius and deep irony of the man mastering the law he was subverting. Lenin was mostly focused on becoming more radical and this period was the start of his career as a revolutionary. Lenin always believed ends ends justified the means no matter how many died. He wrote 10 million words in his life very prolific but not amazingly talented and was an incredible debater. He actually went to the people and tried to understand their plight and listen directly to them. Understanding customers.

    - **Note:** Lenin was a genius and very prolific taking thousands of pictures not one perfect one. Path dependence he was kicked out of school but self educated through radical books. Believed the ends justified the means always and actually became a lawyer which is irony. Shaped Marx to fit Russia.
- The critical moment in Lenin’s life was 1 year after his dad died his older brother was hanged for an assassination plot against the czar. His brother took full responsibility and asked for a pardon but it was too late. He was hanged and the family found out the next day. His mother had wrote the czar for mercy but was denied. The family who had been well respected in town before was now shunned people who would visit regularly no longer spoke to them. They were pariahs the many who had been at his dads funeral shunned his brother saschas. The middle class liberal view had proven so fickle to Vladimir and he developed a deep hate for these people. This was his radicalization moment. He was previously happy and middle class but now he had changed and been radicalized forever. He hated the middle class do gooders who shunned his family after this politics became personal saw them as traitors and cowards. Family moved and he read a lot of the books his brother did and was likewise radicalized. Sasha was angry for the backwards anti intellectual policies that quashed the voice of the middle class and wanted to take the country backward.

    - **Note:** The middle class ethic of sticking with you until it’s no longer fashionable this being left by these people changed Lenin’s life this is his turning point when he scorned what these people did to him and he started reading what his brother did and got radicalized himself.
      Middle class ethic decisive moments
- Lenin was generally progressive toward women for his time he enforced gender roles but would listen and often used his wife and mistress for counsel. He struggled to get along with men as he was iron willed and would not entertain opposing views. He had a very progressive love triangle and he was an emotional man. These women were socialist experts who provided great emotional stability. He wrote to his mom constantly and had a great personal relationship with her. She was the only person he never criticized. His mom was a converted jew and his Jewish heritage was deeply hidden by the party. She never talked politics and was a strong willed women who supported her kids financially and would often go to the towns where they had been jailed and plead for their release and better treatment she was the leader of the house a strong woman who didn’t agree with her childrens revolutionary politics but likewise didn’t meddle in them. She provided love and support above all. His dad was a czar loyalist and far from a revolutionary. He grew in a quiet town with no railroad on the Volga river. He learned to walk very late and looked up to his siblings. The kids were encouraged to read widely and Lenin’s favorite pre Marx book was uncle Toms cabin. Lenin was a genius and chess master school was easy for him his parents set strict time aside for silent study and reading every day. He was a quiet but distant kid with no real friends. His dad was a liberal reformer believing in education for all in a school system that was classiest and censored. He died when Lenin was 15 this was a big blow in his life.

    - **Note:** Lenin was a progressive in ways toward women and had a great relationship with his mother. He was not an open minded person and fairly iron willed, and could not get along with men so surrounded himself with women.
      His parents encouraged him to read widely from a young age and he took this reading voraciously his entire life. He was extremely smart, but a bit of a loner. His dad was pretty down the middle but died young, which shaped his life. Events when we are young shape our lives. Big reader/ learner
      Lenin was not an immoral guy directly, but viewed the world as a machine and people as cogs he was amoral
- Before the revolution Lenin was being investigated and wanted by the Russian government and he was in hiding after 20 years of creating and leading the Bolsheviks through fear and grit he was 47 and he was sparking his revolution to grab power. The bolsheviks weren’t attacking and Lenin wrote frantically as he was in hiding to catalyze the attack. And galvanize his men. He snuck through Russian check points in a bad disguise. Had he been caught and killed the October revolution wouldn’t have happened the Soviets didn’t believe in chance but determinism but this they saw as chance. The revolution was far from secret or well organized it had been published in the papers for 10 days before and the people running it were uncoordinated rejects and amateurs the government was just that much more incompetent. Most people didn’t know the revolution was happening the pm escaped in a convertible and the Bolsheviks had guns that didn’t even work. By the time they entered the palace all the defenders had left 12 were killed 20 were injured in this episode all in crossfire. Lenin could explain complex things simply and was shrewd but was not the average galvanizing leader. The government was incompetent and the revolution went unnoticed pretty much all day.

    - **Note:** The Russian revolution was so clear it was written in the newspaper and few knew it had happened until they read about it the next day. It was just not that important to the people. Lenin though had waited his entire life for this and pushed everyone onwards to make it happen this was a world altering moment that no one in the country cared about at the time everything was so bad backwards and curropt no one really cared.
      Intelligence is reducing complexity to simplicity.
- Lenon was a modern offered simple solutions to a complex problem he lied often used scapegoats but as a man he was not evil but a middle class gentleman. He believed in winning above everything and used political terror to justify his methods but he wasn’t sadistic like Stalin or hitler the killing was mere numbers to him. He was a complex person he espoused Marxist theory but would readily bend it to his ends his cruelty was a function of Russia at the time and he was very cruel but the state needed a dictator for the power vacuum post revolution. He also had a gentle and emotional side and loved nature. Lenin was generally a banal man who knew how to command power.

    - **Note:** Lenin knew how to weild power and did it with no consideration or remorse offering simple solutions to complex problems and commanding power. Ends over means.
