### Highlights

- Starting a New Company and Fixing Vehicles: The Porsche Story
  Key takeaways:
  - A new company was started to fix vehicles, similar to Sony's start in Tokyo.
  - Porsche started fixing old military vehicles in Austria.
  - There were not many cars in Gmoond, which led to a need for a new business idea.
  - Ferry had an idea for a small, faster car.
  - Ferry did not enjoy driving the slow Beetle.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 4
  And they're like, well, what if we start a new company and see what we can do around here.
  Speaker 2
  I mean, there's some vehicles we can start fixing. This is literally like the Sony story if you remember when Sony first got started in Tokyo. At literally the same time, they started by fixing radios.
  Speaker 5
  Porsche. The services business.
  Speaker 4
  The second Porsche company, Porsche Construction in GMBH, which is an Austrian company that they start to do this.
  Speaker 2
  They start up fixing old military vehicles that are around there in Austria. Unlike Sony in Tokyo, though, where there were a lot of radios in Tokyo, there weren't a lot of cars in Gmoond. So pretty quickly, they're like, huh, we don't have any more cars to fix up.
  Speaker 5
  Bad business.
  Speaker 4
  Yeah, well, not a large market, shall we say.
  Speaker 2
  At this point, Ferry has an idea, and it turns out it's a pretty damn good one. He definitely liked and agreed with his father's vision for a small car, a car for the masses of Volkswagen. But he always had one major problem with the Beetle, which was that it was slow. And it just was not fun to drive. ([Time 0:25:54](https://share.snipd.com/snip/581bc649-e0ab-4925-bbd8-19343b5029de))
    - **Note:** Porsche family were big nazis and help launch vw which was founded by hitler during the war they liked the beetle as an idea but thought it was too slow so after they went to prison for war crimes they got out and supercharged it. He found that driving a small car with big power was more fun than a big car with power this was his insight which set off the sports car revolution. This changed the entire thinking of making a car it could be sleek and powerful most sports cars which were rare just thought bigger to have a bigger engine Porsche counter positioned. Post war Porsche gets a sweetheart deal to help with the technical design and distribution of vw and get a fee. They got exclusive rights to sell Porsche across all Europe. The German government owned it and Porsche basically got to ride this wave for free because the manufacturer didn’t want to handle the business side.
- The Evolution of Porsche: From the 356 to the Sedan Project
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And what was starting to happen was the 356 was one of the leaders of the charge of the sports car in that era, and what was clearly starting to happen was other sports cars are showing up that we're refining some of the principles.
  Speaker 2
  Yes.
  Speaker 4
  So we're now in the 60s. Ford announces the Mustang. Jaguar's got the E-type. Chevy comes out with the second generation Corvette, the Stingray.
  Speaker 1
  And all these are starting to show up. Yeah, Austin Hill. Everything is like, okay, there's a lot of pressure.
  Speaker 4
  Yeah. So, okay. In 1962, Ferry Porsche makes the decision like 356 is amazing.
  Speaker 2
  You know, rebirth of the company. We got to invest profits and replace it with a new model.
  Speaker 4
  So for a couple of years, Porsche had actually been working on a design for a sedan for a larger model.
  Speaker 2
  Seems heretical now. Right. I mean, people look at the Panamera and they're like, ew, you know, it was actually like going to be the second model of Porsche.
  Speaker 3
  I mean, I feel that way. Every time I see a Panamera drive by, I'm like, why does Porsche make this car?
  Speaker 5
  But I see them driving by, so that's why they make it car. Right. China is why they make that. So that later.
  Speaker 4
  So the next generation of Porsches, Ferry's son Ferdinand, known as Booty named Ferdinand named after his grandfather, the founder of Porsche, was working in the company and he had been leading the body design for this larger sedan that Porsche was going to make.
  Speaker 2
  Ferry decides for a bunch of reasons that to cancel the sedan project. ([Time 0:55:11](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fbd359e6-70d4-4748-8ca2-be4d4035537d))
    - **Note:** Porsche became known as the best car to race and the best to drive in the street. It won Le Mans for its class and established the sports car that was high end but also a normal street legal car. Because tax rates were so high 95% porche basically had to reinvest in the company or lose the money which lead to a lot of innovation. They develop the 911 which becomes the sports car and synonymous with Porsche and pushes them to new heights. Porsche after the family and maybe the best car maker ever left because of family infighting issues they really struggled to the point where they were building fewer cars in the 80s than the 60s. Mercedes gave them a contract manufacturing order to keep them alive. Professional ceos killed them.
- Porsche's Strategy: Streamlining to the 911
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  And when he does, speaking of Apple, he kind of pulls a Steve Jobs return like moment. He cuts the product lines down to just the 911.
  Speaker 4
  So this is the right thing that needed to be done. But it's also kind of crazy.
  Speaker 2
  He kills the 944, 968. He kills the 928.
  Speaker 4
  He takes everything back down to just the 911 and like analysts, people like car magazines ask him, what's your strategy for an entry level Porsche?
  Speaker 2
  And he says, Porsche's strategy for an entry level Porsche is a used Porsche. Such a good line.
  Speaker 5
  Such a good line. Such a good line.
  Speaker 2
  So by the 95, 96 production year, the 911 is the only Porsche model left on the market, which hasn't been the case since the 356.
  Speaker 6
  This is kind of crazy. Also what kind of company makes one product? Right.
  Speaker 3
  Like, I mean, seriously, what do they believe that this is a transitionary period or do they believe like this is the long-term strategy?
  Speaker 2
  No, it's not like we the king was like, I am a cost cutter and I will cost everything down. Like he is much. Like he has big ambitions. Okay. Big, big, big ambitions. This is a transitionary moment.
  Speaker 4
  He does want to expand the Porsche model line as we shall see. He greatly expands it. So I think this is pretty brilliant. ([Time 1:51:20](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3c0797f3-183e-401c-91d4-a61fe4df0a6b))
    - **Note:** Porsche brings in a new ceo who simplified the product line down to just the 911 to do their bread and butter better than anyone and it helps cut ancillary costs so they can rebuilt the company from a new stable position. They turned the entry level Porsche from a second class citizen to a cheaper version that shared the design language when you bought it you owned a Porsche and it leveraged the 911 guts. Shared the look of the 911 but cheaper inside 100 less horsepower. They then got into SUV’s the original cayenne looked ugly but performance wise was amazing. This was before nice suvs became a thing. This hasn’t hurt their brand equity it has helped the other cars. They also came out with a super car which helped legitimize the brand equity. Their market cap went from 400 mm to 32bn in a decade. 100x but you would’ve had to been insane.
- Negotiations, Ovations, and Acquisitions: The Porsche-VW Saga
  Key takeaways:
  - The company was originally valued at 10x the price they were eventually bought for
  - Ferdinand made a bold move by selling the company
  - Vita King was removed as CEO of Porsche
  - VW purchased Porsche in two stages over three years
  - The final purchase price was eight and a half billion euros
  Transcript:
  Speaker 3
  Yes. So therefore we will help them out by what is it buying them for?
  Speaker 2
  They floated a price of three to four billion euros, which remember like a couple months ago, this company was trading at 10x that.
  Speaker 10
  Whoa.
  Speaker 3
  This is literally Ferdinand saying to Vita King, if you come at the king, you best not miss.
  Speaker 6
  Yes.
  Speaker 2
  This is exactly what is going on. Yeah.
  Speaker 4
  Whoa, indeed. So there's a whole flurry of negotiations. This is all against the backdrop of it being October 2008. Within a few months by January 2009, Vita King is gone as CEO of Porsche.
  Speaker 2
  Supposedly, when he exits the building, he exits to a standing ovation from Porsche employees, which I mean, he kind of deserves, even though like all of this craziness, he did go a bridge too far. He did save the company.
  Speaker 4
  VW does end up buying Porsche, the operating company in two tranches over three years. They buy 50% up front three years later in 2011, they complete the purchase. It ends up being about eight and a half billion euros total.
  Speaker 2
  So between that opening volume of three to four and the 32, it lands at eight and a half. ([Time 2:23:34](https://share.snipd.com/snip/56eae7ed-61fb-42a7-90c7-0a1a4012528e))
    - **Note:** Porsche tries to buy vw but ends up getting overlevered then 2008 happens and the vw actually buys them. Vw was the most valuable company because of the buy pressure caused by Porsche accumulation. The family ends up owning 50% of vw and then got 8bn for Porsche. They own 32% of the combined company but have a majority of voting rights. The family comes out like bandits.
- The Role of German Engineering, Reliability, and Branding in the Luxury Car Market
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, the big one. I suspect that the German engineering thing also plays a role. Like I think now not against BMW and Mercedes Benz, but certainly against like the Japanese, I'm sure their margins are much, much higher than the accuracy and the Lexus is the world. And they, even though the week when you really look at it on paper, it doesn't make sense. There is some level of like this is a German engineering thing like you alluded to earlier has this incredible reputation that helps them. Okay, this car is just simply built better. It's European, it's German.
  Speaker 4
  What kind of thing does that, I think for a long time that expressed itself in reliability of Porsche's relative to other luxury car manufacturers today is that as much as reliability as much an advantage for Porsche as it was in the past. Supposedly reliability is still excellent.
  Speaker 1
  Supposedly based on the JD power studies and all that. Now the question of whether it's actually important for people making decisions by the cars, I'm not so sure how many of those SUV customers are leasing and don't really care if things stays reliable. I don't know. But there is some component of just like quality that you just feel. I mean, it's certainly true. So you get BMW or Mercedes Benz and it's just not as nice. It's not the same. Like you have this feel. It's certainly more special. There's a specialness to it. Okay.
  Speaker 3
  So moving through them, branding. Yes, obviously, like especially if you're trying to enter any space and compete with a luxury brand, you don't have the heritage. ([Time 2:56:46](https://share.snipd.com/snip/daeffce4-3f56-42b4-99c7-d29609f2e3e7))
    - **Note:** Porsche has this weird market niche between luxury and high end bmw types that it makes a decent amount of cars sells it at a premium price. They have great brand they’re nicer then bmw and premium but produce 10x more than Ferrari and the brand equity really bleeds into the suv which is the money maker. Great brand they sell the every day super car and compete with Ferrari and bmw. Unique positioning.
