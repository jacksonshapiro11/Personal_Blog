### Highlights

- How to Build and Scale a Company
  Key takeaways:
  - Company building has two phases: building a product with product market fit and scaling that product
  - Improving a product after scaling is different than building the product from scratch
  - Product managers in a scaling company may not be effective in creating new products
  - Founder types may need to be involved in creating new products during scaling
  - Building a company from scratch is known as zero to one phase
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I first I think there are two parts of company building there are two phases one is at least in the tech world in the product world there's building a product that has product market fit so zero to one and then there's scaling that product once you have product market fit you know one to ten million and those are two very distinct pieces and one has almost nothing to do with the other and in fact it's almost a little dangerous like once you have a product and you're scaling it the process of improving that product is radically different than the process of building it product from zero to one so it's almost dangerous product managers in a scaling company don't actually do a very good job of creating new products you have to go back to founder types but I'm getting into too much detail so Building a company is on the zero to one side I mean there's lots written about this the key is to solve real problems that real people have as opposed to sitting around saying oh wouldn't it be cool if I built blank and then building it and then see who buy it that almost never works what works is going into talking to a bunch of people that you'd like to serve finding out what their actual hair on fire problems are seeing okay now I see this comment out of like this hair and fire problems come up among all these heads of marketing and energy companies if that those are the people that you want to serve and then going and creating the simplest possible solution like something can sketch in a piece of paper and putting that in front of them and saying hey does this Partially solve your problem and then they use it and go oh yeah pretty good but it doesn't do this I wish you do these other things getting real feedback so the idea is to get feedback not to create a good solution in fact the idea is to create a crappy solution so that you get the feedback and having a crappy solution may actually give you more feedback and then with that feedback go build a better solution but very quick very short in a week and then with that better solution go put it in front of those same potential customers see what how they react to that and keep iterating that way with prototype prototype prototype prototype until you've got one two three four then say I want to buy this I want to use this now you got product market fit and by the way You never ever ever worry about scaling or writing industrial code until you've got real paying customers because industrial code is just going to slow you down and you want to write spaghetti crappy prototype code no code doesn't even freaking matter in order to create those prototypes because again you're trying to cycle feedback as quickly as possible that's the product market fit stage now from scaling onwards once you actually have those customers who want it now you got to worry about infrastructure now you got to worry make sure your site doesn't go down now you got to make sure you got security but only then and then unfortunately you're gonna have to hire more people because you're gonna have to hire engineers who build the infrastructure and build the security then salespeople who sell it and customer support people who take the calls unless you're rippling And you don't even have customer support people which I think is genius but most companies self scaling by hiring people I disagree with it I think hiring people is the lazy person's approach to scaling I think if you look at companies like linear which I think now has maybe 40 people maybe less notion which up until a while ago had like 50 people these are companies are bringing in serious revenue I think that's the answer is to simply not had people and just create leverage if you need software you software internally but create leverage for your own people just do more and more and more but that's not what most companies do most companies just hire more people and then they have the problem of well how do you get these people to actually do something useful to something that positive because what most companies Experience is once they go beyond 20 people in one location or once they go remote all of a sudden people don't really know what they're supposed to be doing because they don't over hear the conversations the CEO if everybody could over hear the conversations of the CEO they know exactly what to do they know exactly what the CEO what their priorities are but once they can't hear them anymore then they just work on what they think they should be working on with them very limited information they have which is usually not enough information so you're just working on kind of useless stuff and so companies hire better and better and better people and they do less and less and less and CEOs get very frustrated but the answer of course is this information sharing system where the CEO's priorities can get transmitted to the whole Company on a regular basis and the problems that the team members are experiencing can get transmitted back up to the CEO so that she can go unblock them and that system again is very well documented and that's the next phase that's the phase of implementing that system and you can always tell when a company's implemented the system effectively because they scale so Amazon clearly did a good job of implementing the system take another you know thousand examples of companies that hit product market fit and then went like this almost universally the reason they failed was because they didn't implement an effective management system to share information among the team that's it that's company building right there whole thing ([Time 0:41:05](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8c0cbde5-3d3b-4f57-831c-9e311f9dfe35))
    - **Note:** You need to throw shit at the wall to get to product market fit and once you have it you need to scale like crazy. 2 very different phases.
