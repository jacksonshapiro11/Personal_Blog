  Speaker 1
  We have to reckon with a past and we create patterns that allow us to make sense of a very, very complex world and also to try to figure out where we are trying to go. Everyone's a historian, whether they know it or not. And you're kind of putting together all the facts and all the issues that you see. And you're coming to it in light of the way other people make sense of things to try to understand a past, to situate ourselves in a present. So to me, it's quintessentially an extraordinarily human exercise. And I think that's it. But I think as you practice history and as you read history, history does teach us a couple very, very important lessons. They teach us how to kind of do that patterning. It can make us very confident in that patterning, but at the same time, history teaches us that greatest of all virtues, humility, because it's so vast. And because all the that happened, we can pick on this, that, or the other thing, but we're always going to miss something, and we're always going to often glide past things that contradict What we'd like to believe. History's always knocking on our door, telling us things are always more complex than we think. Good historians embrace that, and I think wise people brace it. So I see history as kind of a road to wisdom. Wisdom that we see, I think, that is all too rarely exhibited sometimes in our age, but I think it's something critical for us to flourish and grow as human beings, but also to understand Ourselves as a society. And so because it's so human, but because it teaches this most important lesson, I think it's also critical. There is one other thing, too. It's kind of an intellectual exercise. There's very few things that are like history because history also teaches us to take into account all of that complexity, but yet try to see the simple through it. It's not to ignore the complexity, but it's to kind of take it all in. And because of that, as they say, it's a great intellectual exercise that you're not only dealing with all the facts, many contradictory, all the interpretations, most of those contradictory, But you're kind of taking it all in and using your wits, using your intelligence, trying to say, how do I make sense of what happened? The act of doing so is how we situate ourselves in the present.
  Speaker 2
  I think as people run their families, run their businesses, investment firms, whatever they're doing, they could use some of these tools that you're referring to. What is the historian's toolkit? What are the things that you utilize to unpack a story, unpack a person, unpack a theme? And what do you think those listening could actually use in their lives to you? Well, there are tangibles. I think there are intangibles. Let me cover some of the tangibles first.
  Speaker 1
  Those are the easy ones. They're the difficult ones to master, but they're the easy ones to understand. And that is, first I said master, is that you have to have a basic mastery of a certain period of time that you're going to study. So there's half-assed ways to do it, and there are ways that you can bluff your way through it, but that's never going to do justice to capturing the dynamics you want to capture. And so that you have to have a basic mastery. History is kind of seeing the simplicity through all the complexity. There's an elegance of mind also that is part of the historian's toolkit, that you have to try to make sense of things, and they should be able to gracefully put together in an elegant Way, in a way that is kind of aesthetically pleasing. That's why good history is beautifully written stuff. It's not this wooden prose of social science. We're humanists, and we believe in the written word, and we believe in elegance. And I think that that is also a cast of mind that lends itself to history. There's an interest and a curiosity in kind of what makes us human. I think that's another thing too that's absolutely critical when it comes to the historian's toolkit. That's an arrow you must have in your quiver. You've got to be curious about people. You have to be curious about the human condition and about what makes us who and what we are. Historians are always arguing about this and puzzling over it because we will never figure out what makes us fully human. What is human nature like? It's something that we have argued about since time immemorial, and we will continue arguing about till kingdom come. So I think those are the tangibles. There's an intangible as well. And this, by the way, is not acknowledged by most historians. Every historian comes to his or her task with their own biases, with their own brokenness, with their own vulnerabilities, with their own strengths. That also is going into that process of trying to understand simplicity in light of all the complexity. A good historian, as I say, is first one who's going to be humble. Humility is the most important thing, but that humility starts with self. And now we have to be extraordinarily intentional about who I am and where I sit when it comes to seeing various kinds of things before I can even start stepping into the past. Most people struggle to do it. That's the more intangible kind thing. But to me, that's what separates the very good historians from the very, very best. They know who they are. They have explored themselves because history, because it is the most human of all sciences, fundamentally as you practice it, is an exploration into self. Because of that, we just keep coming back to it time and time and time again but the more that you know about yourself the better historian you're going to be i can't help but smile thinking
  Speaker 2
  About if will and ariel were sitting here right now here you describe what the best historian really is because the backstory on ([TimeÂ 0:07:53](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b1459b86-da6e-455b-9a7c-e74f68054713))
    - **Note:** A gold historian is rooted in deep research and an understanding of self. Seeing patterns and learning from history.

  Speaker 1
  But when he said this, as he says on page 86, when he's talking about the way that we think about the world and the way that we think about the times in which we live, and we can believe living Today, especially in the wake of the long, long shadow of the Second World War, we live in a period of extraordinary really unprecedented peace and prosperity in the united states is What we've been blessed with but the mistake we make is that we tend to think that this is the normal but as he puts it on again page 86 such interludes of widespread peace are unnatural And exceptional they will soon be ended by changes in the distribution of military power. That's true. We tend to think the bubbles that we live in, because we are mortal beings, because we're bound to bodies, we tend to think that our periods of time are those that are necessarily definitive. That's the way that we are, and that's the way that we're wired or programmed. We have to be able sometimes to step away from that and realize history doesn't just work by the rules that we as mortals would have history work by. That you ultimately begin to see these broader patterns. And when you study more and more of it, you say, well, wait a minute. Wow. Maybe the period of time we're living in now is a little bit different than the norm. And that usually means that there's bad things that are going to be in the offing. Just that the onverse is true, too. When things are awful and miserable, you would think that's the way things naturally have to be from this time all the way forward. That's not the way it is too. Things turn and things can turn quickly. That's one of the great lessons. And I think what he offers because of it and why I was gobsmacked when I read it is he just offers beautiful perspective based upon all the things that he's read. So they say history is about seeing those patterns. He's seen them all. And he may not have seen them as kind of an academic historian is going to be delving down into each one of them as we necessarily are trained to do. But he really tries to step back and draw all the various strands together. And based upon that, see what he regards as certain almost rules that we see. They're not only rules about the past, the way the past works, but by extension, they're rules about how we as human beings function and how we work. And that can only be done, I think, with perspective. And as I said before, the other thing is wisdom. I was really struck by there's lots of wisdom in this book, sometimes unwelcome wisdom, but most times wisdom is quite unwelcome.
  Speaker 2
  When you jumped in the classroom, you quoted the end of his prelude. He entitles it Hesitations. I'll just read a sentence that finishes it. It is a precarious enterprise, and only a fool would try to compress a hundred centuries into a hundred pages of hazardous conclusions. Yet we proceed. That's become a mantra for the class, by the way, that we proceed in the face of all challenges and the face of our small place in the cosmos. It still is a nobling enterprise to try to find our way through this.
  Speaker 1
  We proceed. I love that. I love it all different kinds of ways. The crafty writing nerd in me loves it because it's a two-word sentence is a thing of beauty. Pop right in the face. Historians can get other words. On the one hand, we have this, and on the other hand, getting bogged down in the complexity. He's saying, look at all this complexity. We can get lost. It can be a maze to us in what we want to do. We proceed. It's, again, bracing. And the idea, yes, we're going to do. This is a fool's errand trying to make sense of all this complexity that is the human condition. We proceed. And that's what we're called to do. And so there's a great sense of almost vocation in this book of going forward. And it's not only what historians do. All of us can be paralyzed by sort of all the complexity we do. Damn it, we proceed. And that's all there is. Yes, it's going to be stormy seas, it's going to be choppy. We sail. To me, that's the beauty of being human. We're willing to take the risk. Life is about that risk. Get out there and take the risk. Do your best job. Now, you don't want to be a fool about it. And they're not fools. They have extraordinary amounts of perspective to bring based upon all that they saw. Nonetheless, it is still a food's hour. You would have to be a god living on Olympus to really understand everything that had happened in the past and making sense of who we are and how we do it. We proceed. I love it.
  Speaker 2
  There's a lot of tough wisdom in here. Once we get past that beautiful call to action, let's spend some time going through some of these. This is one of two books we have all of our students read every time we teach. And without fail, they're struck by a lot of what they think is life wisdom, but also this undertone of ruthlessness, of harshness, of reality. And that's tough for a 22-year to take when you're brimming with hope, brimming with some experience, and yet ready to go in the world and hopefully have some success, but also, as we Know, hit a lot of failures and a lot of bumps in the road. The way they designed the book is these short, punchy chapters on these big dozen headers. From history in the earth to biology, religion, economics, government. We get into revolution. There's socialism, democracy. What are some of your favorite lessons that come out of this? There's so many. But I think the one thing is the big lesson for me is he knocks us down to size.
  Speaker 1
  We go out in this world with the understandable illusion that we're the masters of our destiny, that we can make and we can shape ourselves. And that's kind of the ideology that so much of us live by, particularly growing up in the United States or in Western Europe. But the United States is particularly heightened because of the strength of the libertarian ethos, that that's the conceit that we believe. He's saying, not really. That's a fiction. Now, for us, it's kind of a useful fiction that we organize ourselves by. And if we're blessed enough to be coming from the background that supports that and sustains that, if we're blessed to have the education that's necessary to allow that conceit to live On, that's going to be it. But he seems to suggest that, hey, sooner or later, you're going to have to come to terms with life as it is, not as you would have it. That's hard for our students. It's hard for lots of us. That's the stuff that like midlife crises are actually made up when you're finally coming to grips with. Oh my God, you mean all this stuff dealt with before is kind of like a fairy tale and now I have to deal with life as it is. And they're trying to say there's a certain kind of freedom to understand life as it actually is, to live without those illusions. Then you begin to see that at the same time, everything chalked through this. This whole book is a refutation of nihilism in some kind of way, because you could just fall into it and say, we're just these biological entities that happen to be on this orb that's spinning At this particular point in time. And we've created packs with ourselves because we're thinking apes that just allow us to live with some kind of modicum of pieces. We all try to scramble for power, for status, for money, and then we're dead. And there's some of that in here. It is a Blake picture. But the fact that he wrote this book puts paid to that whole perspective because he says, yes, that's all true. ([TimeÂ 0:16:27](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ebdc7b10-7938-4b82-add5-1d883d166a15))
    - **Tags:** #uncertainty, #histroical-knowledge, #bravery, #courage
    - **Note:** We proceed in the face of uncertainty and challenges with our best foot forward because we have to proceed itâs our only real option. History provides useful perspective. Come to life as is not as you want it to be. Studying history allows us to claim our humanity.
- Balance Innovation with Roots
  Summary:
  The tension between innovation and tradition is essential for a healthy society.
  It emphasizes the need to value the conservative voices that preserve foundational elements, alongside the radical propositions that drive change. Rapid, unconsidered change can lead to chaos, while excessive conservatism stifles progress.
  A balanced approach recognizes the importance of maintaining roots while integrating new ideas.
  Influential figures in history often act as bridges between these two forces, possessing the ability to navigate complexities and harness the zeitgeist of their time.
  These leaders articulate change in a way that respects historical context and integrates it into their vision for the future. Their roles include grounding innovations in established wisdom, highlighting the importance of evaluating the impacts of change, and ensuring that society does not abandon its valuable heritage for the sake of novelty.

  Speaker 2
  I know you have the 10,000 story of civilization, which Durant calls Lessons of History the small postlude to that, which they spent 40-plus years on. There's a number of other writings from the Durants. One was discovered in the last decade. It was a secret diary from Will, finally letting him share his version of his lessons. He would still say Lessons of History is the amalgamation of what others have said, called Fallen Leaves. We'll put that on your bookshelf for after the 10,000 pages. One of the things that stood out to me from that book is he goes on for a long time about the tension and the tensile strength of the young versus the old. In Lessons of History, he mentions in his chapter on character that so the conservative who resists change is as valuable as the radical who proposes it, perhaps as much more valuable As roots are more vital than graphs. This just hits me. Maybe I'm getting more towards middle age, but I still think of myself as young and someone who wants to build and create. And I know that Rick and I are right on that precipice of turning that over. And probably our kids think we're old and extremely conservative about, not in the political sense, but in terms of wanting to hold on to the roots. How has that evolved for you as an historian, as a person over time, this tension of making sure, and this is for business too, we need innovation. AI is the watchword in Silicon Valley right now, and we need this. And yet the roots of the companies that will use AI are extremely deep. And usually they will just take the new technology and bring it in to the trees that are already being built. It's this tension that we find fascinating. We don't want to spur innovation and risk-taking from our students. But on the other hand, we want them to be realistic that civilization is carried forward by the conservation of the roots themselves.
  Speaker 1
  Without a doubt. And I think you always need a cadre of people, as Bill Buckley put it, you know, standing at Ford history and saying, stop. And it's healthy for a society when we have both. As you put it, it's a tensile strength, but it's also one of those good and animating tensions. If we're ever in a world where one is going to be done away with at the expense completely of the other, that's not a good place that you want to be in. A world of so-called unending change and just, oh, it's going to be better if we can only do this, that. There's always a lot of people who can look back and say, you know what? There were certain ways we did things before that we have to kind of maintain or realize that if we have too much fundamental change too quickly, it's really going to do all kinds of damage. And we have to make sense of all that damage. You look at the age of revolution, for example, that I would study. You have lots of proponents of extraordinarily radical change. You want to change society root and branch. And that's the terms they're going to use. Got to uproot everything as much as possible so that we can start anew and we can plant a new tree of liberty, whatever it's going to be. But at the same time, you have those characters like Edmund Burke who are saying, no, wait a minute, wait a minute. And I think that Burke to a certain extent is misunderstood because Burke isn't a guy who's avowedly against all kinds of change, not at all. He's just like, we have to take into account the institutions and we have to take into account the wisdom of generations that have become before planting certain kinds of things. And we have to be very careful as we go about enacting any kind of change. And it's not that we have to hold onto things for the sake of holding onto them, or it's not that we have to hold onto things for the sake of nostalgia, making something great again, or looking Back or trying to revive a past that in effect never was. That's not what it's about. But it's realizing that as we are going to go forward, if you're going to uproot everything, you are going to be in for a world of hurt, a vast world of hurt. Because if we have a society that's dominated exclusively by conservatives, there's no innovation. If we live in a society that's dominated by all progressives, there's no order. And what we're trying to do, ultimately, a healthy society is one that is trying to strike a balance between the two. It means that the prophets of change, even if they're not themselves going to embrace, if you will, a kind of a more conservative appreciation of holding on to certain kinds of things, There have to be people whose voices are going to be reckoned with who are going to be saying, oh, wait a minute. If I'm not saying stop, I at least have to say every now and again, we have to tap the brakes and realize where we're going. That is a healthy tension in any society. And we see in those cases in the past where one or the other is going to dominate, it's not a very good place to live. Given that, what's the role of the hero or the genius in history?
  Speaker 2
  Knowing that almost by definition, someone who is put into that category is pushing back maybe on the order that has been ruling the day.
  Speaker 1
  The question, do men make the times or do times make the men? The answer, of course, is yes. There are individuals at time who do possess certain kinds of gifts. One of those gifts, too, is what I think is the historian's sensibility of seeing the simplicity in light of all the complexity. I think anybody who's going to be a great innovator, who's a person who's going to make a mark on a time, necessarily is someone who has to, one way, shape, or form, be a pretty good historian. But they also possess a certain kind of charisma. They can only emerge onto the stage during a certain period of time when there's going to be a critical mass. We're going to be willing to listen to them or willing to take advantage of what they have to say. History is filled with all sorts of accidents. History is filled with, of course, all kinds of events, contingencies. These too are shaping what's going to happen. But there's certain kind of people from time to time who are able to not get swallowed up by the waves, but know how to surf on the waves. We see them. These are the people probably that we recognize are the folks who evolve as the leaders in a society, the true leaders in a society, the people who are able to capture the zeitgeist of An age and make sense of it. And it doesn't so much mean that they're the ones who are shifting history. They're the ones who are able to make sense of it for us all and are able to kind of articulate and crystallize what is going on. And then there are some people also are going to be the people who can build institutions based upon the capturing of that zeitgeist. And those are people also that we tend to look on as the true leaders or heroes. ([TimeÂ 0:31:16](https://share.snipd.com/snip/30f82095-8d73-4a5f-a878-c71c4ba7693f))

- Mastery Through Management
  Summary:
  Effective management is hierarchical; those who can lead people have the ability to oversee those who handle objects or resources.
  The capacity to manage finances amplifies this authority, as financial management is a key skill that enables one to oversee all aspects of operations, illustrating the broader impact of managerial skills across different domains.
