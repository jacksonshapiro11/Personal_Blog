  Speaker 2
  We invested in 100 companies this year. It's more than I've ever done. That's the same amount I did in first seven here. So my career and 100% of the time, they are not expecting to raise like some giant seed or series A. They're raising just the amount of money they need. And they're keeping their expenses absurdly low. The biggest trend I'm seeing is outsourcing of talent. And so Americans, and I'm not going to make this like a huge anti-American thing, but the level of entitlement and the effort Americans are putting into jobs expecting 150k, let's say, And then offshoring a developer, Latin America, Portugal keeps coming up Canada. They're all looking for what's the most efficient way for me to build a 10 person team. And then I'll see a burn rate of $30,000 with 10 people. How's that possible? Like, oh, our developers cost 22,000 or SDRs or 10. And like, how's that possible? Oh, we have two people in Manila, etc. Long way of saying efficiency, efficiency, efficiency, but we have to get to break even with the money we just got. We're not expecting a second round of funding. And a lot of them are raising, but 500k to 1.5 million. And if this was 2020, it would be three to 10.
  Speaker 3
  We talk about like AI as like a big disruptor to like the big companies and this and that, but AI may be the biggest disruptor to VC. Big time. In the end. Explain what you mean. I know what you mean, but I want the audience to understand this. Let's say you raise a $2 million seed round. In the past, what you would do to your point, Jason, is you would hire seven people at $200,000 each. So now you have a $1.4 million burn. So you basically have, and let's just say you co-work someplace, you have a year and a half. And so you're a pedal to the metal, right? You're basically trying to throw as much spaghetti against the wall as possible. See what sticks by as many ads, do whatever it takes. The money basically goes to AWS and Facebook and a couple of other companies to Google. And then you hope that there's enough traction where somebody then writes you a $10 or $15 million series H. Now, if you take that same $2 million, you could have a three person team, four person team, half of them offshore, where they also use things like co-pilot, which is like a two to three X lever. Now, all of a sudden, they have the same 10 person team, and it costs $40,000. Exactly. And so now all of a sudden, they have four years. So why wouldn't they do that where they would still own 80% of that company? And all of a sudden, there is a potential to exit it for 50 million or 100 million. And they've made more money than a traditional outcome if you sold it for two billion precisely the case. This is literally what founders are modeling right now.
