### Highlights

- **Engineering-Led Founders**
  - Founders should be driven by more than the allure of the title.
  - A true founder's motivation stems from a deep passion for problem-solving, especially using engineering to tackle business opportunities.

  What was the motivation to like become a founder in the first place? Definitely the nerd snipe. I think for some people, the allure of being a founder could be convincing enough to start something, but I think those people won't last. Once it gets really rocky and rough, like you're going to be pulling out your hair and losing sleep and like having a lot of stress and those people are probably going to drop out for me Is mainly the engineering side. I did a little MEV on Ethereum back in like the end of 2021 and early 20 or any end of 2020, early 2021, and just got really nerd sniped by like Validair client software and trading and all These things I'd never previously got exposed to. And then especially getting into Solana, like I, I was, uh, I studied computer engineering, did firmware, like low level. I think Solana is a pretty, they, they take the performance of the software very seriously. And so, uh, just kind of diving into that and learning more about that. And I feel like I'm kind of getting like re-nerd sniped all over again with Fire Dancer and like the low level engineering stuff that's going on there. So I think it's definitely like an engineering thing. And obviously like you're going to build a company, you can't just be like working on pet projects. There's got to be a business opportunity that you're not getting paid to build code. You're getting paid to solve people's problems. So it was kind of the marriage of like, there's a lot of cool engineering work to do here, but also there's like a massive business opportunity.
