    - **Note:** Jim was often behind at 16 he was kicked out of school and at 40 he has multiple divorce and been fired multiple times. He then founded 3 billion dollar tech companies. He learned hard lessons about control equity in companies and carving out a role that fits your skills innovator vs professional manager. He grew up dirt poor and struggled with having enough. He transitioned successfully from the software to hardware stage of the valley and always worked with the best a players. They’re 10x better. Even after a billion dollar success he struggled to hire Marc andreesen was the only 1 of 12 who accepted the co founder in what became his second billion dollar company. His first vc funder exploited him and go blackballed. What he did was incredibly hard. Grew up poor was mentally flexible failed a lot along the way that led to his eventual success

  Speaker 1
  And so the author, Michael Lewis, is driving into Plainview, Texas, and he's interviewing Jim's mom Hazel and his sister Sue. So his mom said that most of what she knows about her son's illustrious career, she knew from having Reddit and magazines. She has difficulty squaring the boys she raised with the man she read about. Remember, it started the podcast with, hey, he dropped out of high school and he winds up making himself three or four billion dollars. So it says she has difficulty squaring the boys she raised with the man she read about. She has no advanced theory to why Clark became who he became. In the middle of this conversation, they're having the phone rings and his sister picks it up and she goes, no, we're not investing right now. No, no, I said we're not investing and then she hangs up the phone. And Michael's like, what's going on? And she returns and she says, she explained that the shares in Netscape, that Clark had given them, meaning the family, his sister and his mom, right, had made them rich. And I'm going to pause right there because I want to tell you the note I left myself before I read the rest of this paragraph to you. I go, it is worth remembering that your drive, that fire in the belly that you have benefits other people as well. So why would I say that at this point? Because she just said, hey, we get a bunch of calls now and people know that we're rich because of the stock options that Clark gave us, right? And she said, you have to understand, she said, that when this happened, meaning that when we got the stock options, we were poor.

    - **Note:** Jim Clark came from nothing founded 3 billion dollar tech companies. Clarks dad was an alcoholic who after his mom divorced him would still terrorized the family. This lead to Jim taking life into his own hands and standing up to his dad who never bothered the family again. He was a self described loser living on $200 a week for a family of 4. He played the tuba because it was the only free instrument to play. He got expelled from school around the last time he saw his dad around 16. He came back talking about computers to a hometown where computers didn’t exist. Expelled from school then went in the navy. Went from unfit to graduate high school to navy to doctor in comp sci in 8 years. He learned he was gifted and math and about computers in the navy. He used success as a fork of revenge. If you want to understand the success study the juvinile delinquent. Between 1970-78 he has been married twice had 4 jobs moved across the country 3 times and was fired for insubordination.

  Speaker 1
  The delinquent is saying with his actions this sucks I'm going to do my own thing. Jim had a turbulent early career between 1970 and 1978 he had been married at least twice moved back and forth across the country at least three times and held at least four different Jobs he was fired for insubordination at which point a wife and not his first left him. He tried to explain this extraordinary leap in his career from 38 year old unsuccessful college professor to founder of a multi billion dollar corporation. And this is the most powerful paragraph in the entire book. One day I was sitting at home and I remember having the conscious thought you can dig this hole as deep as you want to dig it. I remember thinking my God I'm going to spend the rest of my life in this fucking hole. You reach these points in life where you say fuck I've reached some sort of dead end here and you descend into chaos. All those years you thought you were achieving something and you achieved nothing. I was 38 years old. I had just been fired. My second wife had just left me. I had somehow fucked up. I developed this maniacal passion for wanting to achieve something. The result of this self imposed psychology surprised even Clark. He insists that the transformation occurred overnight and that he cannot really explain it. Okay so let's go into Jim's philosophy. This is going to remind you I just did this two part series on Van Ever Bush if you haven't listened to those episodes are extremely important to listen to Jim's. I don't know if they're the exact same but Jim's whole thing or Van Ever's whole thing is like hey engineers are the engine of capitalism and they should be rewarded as such. ([Time 0:17:20](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b41802ba-4d29-48cb-a6f8-8165e29b799d))
    - **Note:** He at 38 was a failure and a loser. He realized he needed to make a big change and developed a maniacal passion for achievement. Drastically changed his world view. He changed more or less overnight. New growth theory wealth comes from the human imagination and the engineers should be the wealthy ones. Tolerance for non conformism. Jim was part of both the engineering build out of the physical then move to the application building side of wealth. Jim had work that felt like play. Unclear to see where work stopped and measure began. Jim created value from silicon graphics but they sold so much equity non got rich they were one of the smartest groups of people ever assembled. Jim gave up 40% of his company for $800k ended up being worth billions and he learned a massive lesson he would never repeat.
- The Impact of Professional Management on Company Culture
  Key takeaways:
  - The appointment of a professional CEO named McCracken led to a change in company culture, which caused the founder, Jim, to leave the company.
  - Before professional management, the company embodied the personality and vision of its founder.
  - Silicon Graphics in the mid-1980s reflected the behavior and traits of its founder, Jim Clark.
  - The company was characterized by a collection of argumentative, brilliant, and stubborn engineers who prioritized building innovative products over financial success.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  They're like, we're going to bring in a professional CEO. They bring in this guy named McCracken. And I'll get into the environment that McCracken creates in which Jim cannot and will not participate in. So he winds up just leaving the company. And his solution every time, or almost every time is, all right, the solution is we need to start another company. But before I get there, I just want to point out what was the company like before professional quote unquote, quote unquote professional management came in. And it's this quote that came that I read one time about Steve Jobs. And it says he remade or he made and remade Apple in his own image. Apple is Steve Jobs with 10,000 lives. This is something that appears over and over again. The leader, the founder of the company, the leader of the company, they imbibe. They put into the company, the personality. It says one way of viewing Silicon Graphics in the mid 1980s is if an extraordinary willful human being with great technical aptitude is permitted to create a large business. How will that organization behave? By 1984, everyone understood that it would behave like Jim Clark, which is to say that it would behave as no big successful American company had ever behaved. It would be a loose collection of argumentative, brilliant, bullheaded engineers who might or might not make money, but almost certainly would build something wonderful. ([Time 0:30:53](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e977a228-b49b-437f-ac37-bb063b3def63))
    - **Note:** He built the companies in his image a loose collection of incredibly smart and argumentative engineeers who might not make money but would build great technology. When he gets in a bad situation he usually leaves. When Jim had professional managers come in he lost control and left. Clark always believed you need to disrupt yourself but the professional managers don’t listen because they were making billions to him so Jim quiet quits. Jim left to show his old boss he was better than he was. Find a young 22 year old Marc Andreesen who tells him about the internet as the future and he leave to do this. The story of silicon valley was one of constant disruption. Recruiting is the most important thing for a company. Andreesen was 1 of 12 who was being interviewed to start the company and has the only one that said yes he was coming from the most successful start up on the valley so it’s much tougher for literally everyone else
- John's $500 Million Success and the Exceptional Skills of Steve Jobs
  Key takeaways:
  - John cleared $500 million in 18 months or 30 times his original investment.
  - The co-founder of Healthion, named Paulven or Paven, makes a point about Steve Jobs and the technology industry.
  - Steve Jobs believes that the range between the best and average in most things in life is about 30%, but Wozniak was 50 times better than the average engineer.
  - The passage mentions a book from 1997 called 'In the Company of Giants' that features interviews with 16 technology company founders.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  John had cleared $500 million in 18 months or 30 times his original investment. So in this next company, one of the co-founders, I think he's a co-founder. Pretty sure he's a co-founder of Healthion. It's this engineer named Paulven. He makes, or Paven, maybe, he makes the point. I'm just going to read what he said because what's fascinating is if you read about Steve Jobs, he says this at the beginning of his career, the middle of his career, and the end of the career. And he talks about the fact that they're in the technology industry. And I think there's a lot of other things like this. I would argue maybe literature, like authors are definitely like this, movies. I would argue that podcasts are the same thing, but that for most things in life, the range between, this is Steve talking. For the most things in life, the range between the best and the average is 30% or so. The best airplane flight, the best meal, they may be 30% better than your average one. What I saw with Wozniak was somebody who was 50 times better than the average engineer. In fact, yesterday, let me pull it up, I was rereading my highlights from that book in the company of giants. That's Founders Episode 208. If you haven't listened to it yet, I highly recommend you to listen to it after this one. And there's something in this book that I was thought was interesting because that book is published in 1997. It's to Stanford MBA students who are interviewing 16 technology company founders, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, all these people on there. ([Time 0:47:46](https://share.snipd.com/snip/58635bc1-d972-44f3-9198-80d5ae743c34))
    - **Note:** Jim understood his skills and weaknesses he didn’t like big companies so post ipo he designed a chairman role for himself. The difference between A and B players is 10x-50x. Clark was willing to take risk others shunned and this helped him gain agency and write the story he wanted. Turned chickens into pigs. In a breakfast the chicken lays and egg and a pig gives it’s life you need more pigs than chickens. The internet has broadened the scope for opportunities there’s always new opportunities there’s more possibilities than realized outcomes. There’s no special reason for the world the way it is no essentially nature malleable world. Clarke kept moving the number he needed to retire higher and higher which guaranteed his dissatisfaction. He always needed another mountain and someone to doubt him. He never let himself be satisfied.
