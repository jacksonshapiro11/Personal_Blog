- Challenge Fake Rules and Embrace Divine Discontent
  Summary:
  The key insights from the snip focus on challenging the traditional habits of businesses by embracing divine discontent.
  It emphasizes the importance of adopting eight creative virtues while simultaneously replacing old patterns of self-defeating behaviors. Each habit has a corresponding vice, and by focusing on virtues like courage, idealism, curiosity, playfulness, candor, intuition, free-spiritedness, and persistence, a positive company culture can be cultivated.
  The snip stresses that these habits are essential for all disciplines and not limited to a specific industry or craft, urging individuals at all levels of an organization to embrace these virtues and veer away from the corresponding vices for a more innovative and successful business approach.

  Speaker 1
  I'm going to paraphrase, but he says something like, you know, what do you do when you do something wonderful? Like you just wake up the next day and try to do something wonderful again. That is very similar to the idea that David is trying to teach us with divine discontent. And so they come up with eight habits of highly creative communities. And each short chapter is on one of these eight habits. And so before I jump into the first chapter, I just want to give you the overview that they give us to the ancient Greeks. A good habit was called a virtue while a bad habit was known as a vice. Each of these eight habits has a corresponding evil twin. While we work at adopting the eight creative virtues, we have to work equally hard to replace the old patterns of self defeating behaviors. Why? Because there's an old Latin proverb that tells us a nail is driven out by a nail. A habit is overcome by another habit. It is important to note that all these eight habits are required in all of our disciplines and are by no means proprietary to just an advertising agency, meaning it's applicable to any Business, any craft, any discipline. These eight habits belong to the whole church. And so it gives you the virtues that they're trying to make sure that every single person up and down the organizational chart is using and the vices that they want you to avoid and how They and how they relate to each other. So I'm going to start with the vices, right? Because that's a bad habit. A habit that you're going to see reoccur more frequently than the good virtue that needs to replace it. So companies operate out of fear. We do not want to operate a fear. We want to operate with courage. Companies optimize for experience. We want to optimize for idealism. Companies stick to the status quo. We want to be curious. Most companies are boring. We want to be playful. Most companies have a tyranny of politeness, which means we just lie to each other. We want to have a culture of candor. Most companies are run on cold arithmetic. We are going to optimize for our intuition. Most companies fall into bureaucracy. We want a culture of free spiritiness. Most people give in and we will persist. So let's take these habits, these cornerstones of good company culture in order. Habit number one is courage. Under each habit at the beginning, there's usually a short quote that illustrates the idea that they're going for. This sounds like Ogilvy, but it doesn't say it was Ogilvy. There's no shortage of brains in the industry. It's the vertebrae column that tends to be missing. When I read that, it made me immediately think of something I read in Peter Thiel's book, Zero to One, episode 278. ([Time 0:04:49](https://share.snipd.com/snip/bf3bbc05-2175-4d07-9600-f844c1c41a52))

    - **Note:** Devine discontent youre airways a bit unhappy with your performance and pushing yourself to grow. We need to have good habits and avoid vices habits replace other habits must act from courage not fear expediency vs idealism they’re curious not status quo playful not boring candor not politeness free spirited not beauracratic don’t give in persist. No shortage of brains but a shortage of backbone more courage in shorter supply than genuis. Fear is the vice the crowds out courage fear is the mind killer. Fear leads to self doubt which is the worst thing for creativity. Fear is principal adversary and courage is the most important virtue. Only with a spine will we stop double guessing and express a true opinion stand up for what you believe in that leads to trust and trust is the most important force on earth. When our dreams become little we become little people don’t focus on next quarter, and not the future we miss out on growth play offense, not defense. Our success relies on the size of our dreams the people who believe they can change the world are the only ones that do.
- Curiosity is important. We live in this amazing world, and most of us close our eyes to it, but we need to embrace it see the beauty and amazement pause for wonder and ask stupid questions. See the world as new and amazing. Playfulness we’re all born children and the great people keep this playfulness. Encourage playfulness and fun make people purely love what they do and success comes. Only dead fish comes with the flow the tyranny of politeness is bad we need to have candor. If we avoid candor we destroy trust. Choose conflict over agreement. Intuition is the art of listening to the guru inside of us. Let intuition guide you. You need eccentric non conformist people dessenter and rebels hire crackpots. There are no rules don’t become stale beuracracy but infuse life in the busines. Atmosphere is the permission to practice magic empower your people to create.

- Embrace Uncertainty and Ignorance in the Creative Process
  Summary:
  Creating an atmosphere of trust allows individuals to be alchemists, transforming ideas through a seemingly magical process.
  Embracing uncertainty, self-doubt, and ignorance is crucial in the creative process, as it opens up possibilities for innovation and breakthroughs. Persistence is key for problem-solvers, as they navigate through challenges like dead ends, blind spots, and roundabouts, embracing the roller coaster ride of uncertainty on the path to success.

  Speaker 1
  An atmosphere is permission to practice magic. David made the management of these intangibles the principal responsibility of the top man, of himself, right? Inside a company with atmosphere, the people are not servants to the system. They are alchemists, let's define alchemists. That is a person who transforms or creates something through a seemingly magical process. What else is left to do but trust the people we work with and set them free? That brings us to habit number eight, persistence. This is how a problem solver goes to work. Dead ends, cabin fevers, blind spots, zigzags, U-turns, roundabouts, and loop-de-loops are all part of the creative process. You see, those who live by their wits go to work on roller coasters. That is excellent. You see, those who live by their wits go to work on roller coasters. The ride is exhilarating, but one has to have a stomach of titanium. For starters, you're never 100% certain you'll ever get there. And if you even get to your destination, you sometimes wonder where you've ever bothered. Other times, the scenery pleasantly surprises you. Self-doubt comes with the territory, and ignorance, believe it or not, is an asset. Experience and knowledge make a sensible, predictable, and dull, but if you don't know that you don't know, you're ideally poised for a leap across a chasm. So again, there's a million entrepreneurs that'll tell you, hey, if I knew how hard it was gonna be, like they get to the other side of success, right? Build a successful company, like if I knew how hard it was gonna be, there's no way in hell I would have tried. ([Time 0:22:17](https://share.snipd.com/snip/cd94dae8-be3c-44e1-b776-d9c89bff5261))
    - **Note:** When you sell problems, it’s constantly zigzagging and heading dead ends until you reach some answer. Failure is constant idea generation is like being on a roller coaster loop de loop and an uneasy stomach, with a aura of self doubt that you’ll ever get to the answer. Ignorance is an asset because if you know how difficult it would be you’d never try. You don’t assume you look everywhere nature books people ect discovery is seeing what everyone else is seeing and coming up with a different thought. You beg borrow and steal your ideas build on someone’s on ideas and you never give in. Never given in persistence, is key, dog, and determination is what the moderately from incredibly creative. Constant persistence. No quantim leap just constant incremental improvement that looks like a step change. we are what we repeatedly, do so excellence, is a habit, not an act. Only when we stay at it and push toward the eight habits while we keep the underdog, David mentality and be able to stay young and creative. Write a book for the company culture.
