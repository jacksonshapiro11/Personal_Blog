### Highlights

- Financial Repression and the Erosion of Debt Value
  Key takeaways:
  - Inflation erodes the value of debt and is known as financial repression.
  - Financial repression occurs when the interest rate is held below the level of inflation.
  - High inflation and hyperinflation in certain European countries wiped out the value of debt after World War I.
  - Inflation was used to eradicate roughly half of British and American war debts through financial repression.
  - Interest rates have been rising, but a chart of real interest rates tells a different story.

  Well, it's a inflation just quietly erodes the value of debt. It's a thief in the night. The economists have a term for this, financial repression. And financial repression is when the rate of interest is held below the level of inflation. And that serves to erode the value of the debt. Now, for instance, after the First World War in Europe, in certain countries in Europe, France, Germany, Austria, Hungary, we had high inflation in France and hyperinflation in these other countries that wiped out the value of the debt. After the Second World War, you again had inflation in Europe and in Japan to wipe out the war debts. But the British and the Americans went through a prolonged period of financial repression, in which roughly half their war debts were paid off by inflation rather than through repayment of the debts, or by growth in GDP. It was the eradication of debt through inflation. And that, I think, is the norm of the modern world. And if you think about it over the last year, people have been pointing out that interest rates are rising. But if you actually look at a chart of real interest rates, real interest rates ([Time 0:29:07](https://share.snipd.com/snip/56eba479-26f6-4b18-b871-372de6021050))
    - **Note:** Financial repression using inflation to decrease the net amount being paid on debt while services go up with inflation money goes down so debt is net reduced.
- The Importance of Interest Rates in Maintaining Intertemporal Equilibrium
  Key takeaways:
  - Asset price bubbles and excessive risk-taking are indications that the interest rate has been set wrong
  - Intertemporal disequilibrium occurs when there is an imbalance between present and future required activities
  - Interest is the most important invention in the history of finance

  Speaker 1
  But then you see, if the real rate, if the natural rate of interest isn't revealed just by inflation or deflation, then I think, what I say in the book is, you know, when you haven't got the natural rate of interest, when you know when the rate of interest is wrong, is that's when you're getting these asset price bubbles or this excessive risk-taking or this buildup of leverage. So, these are other indications that the interest rate has been set wrong. And I mean, at this stage, I'd just introduce another idea, which we haven't really discussed, which is a point made by a Yale economic financialist drunk, Bill Goatsman. He says interest is the most important invention in the history of finance because it allows transactions to take place across time. Now, Hayek in the 1920s started to play around with this idea of what he called intertemporal disequilibrium. An intertent disequilibrium is frankly when there is an imbalance between the present, your present activities and your future required activities. So, if you have too much debt, you have an intertemporal imbalance. If asset prices are overinflated, that's another form of intertemporal imbalance because the returns on the assets when they're super inflated are not going to meet the requirements of investors who purchase those super inflated assets. They're going to lose money. ([Time 0:44:53](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e6cd7f0b-dbe5-40af-b458-176ff586e674))
    - **Note:** Interest with the tvom allows you to shift capital across time.
- The surreal market of negative interest rates and role reversal of bonds and equities
  Key takeaways:
  - Bonds with negative yields were bought for capital gains while stocks were held for income
  - Negative interest rates made the role of bonds fill the role of equities
  - Central banks borrowed lavishly and issued $8 trillion worth of reserves globally to buy securities
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And so people were actually thinking at a time when say $18 trillion worth of bonds were trading at negative yields that you bought bonds with negative yields for capital gains, whereas you hold stocks for income. I mean, there are so many different areas in which when one looks back on 2020 to 2021, what was happening there was quite surreal. And I think this zero negative rate of interest, the lavishness with which the central banks borrowed, I think roughly so globally, issued $8 trillion worth of reserves during that period to buy securities that I'm pretty sure is the main move for all of these crazy markets.
  Speaker 2
  The articulation that when interest rates go negative, that part of the book where, just like you said, people would buy equities for the revenues that the company would make the value of the dividends and then people would buy bonds for the capital appreciation. So like, well, the negative interest rates are making the clock go backwards. And they're also making the role of bonds, fill the role of equities and the role of equities, fill the role of bonds. Like, everything is just upside down. I thought that was just like a great articulation of the whole book. I'm wondering if you could do a similar unpacking of devil take the hindmost, just as a title. ([Time 0:58:56](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ce94555f-29d1-40b4-82c1-e57e38b76ddc))
    - **Note:** The everything bubble created a negative value of time so people bought bonds for capital gains and stocks for interest perverted money supply. Devil take the hindmost is in speculative bubbles the last one out gets killed taken by the devil.
- Our Failure to Learn from History
  Key takeaways:
  - Human society keeps repeating the same financial bubbles and crises throughout history
  - Authors discuss the lack of progress in learning from past mistakes when it comes to navigating financial markets
  - The speaker questions the ability of the human species to avoid future financial crises
  - According to the authors, society is not getting better at avoiding financial bubbles, but rather, getting worse
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  And one thing that's clear to me after reading both of your books is that we keep on we as a species as a society, run through the same things over and over and over again. And I think by the time when I was going through double take the hindmost, I had gotten to the 1920s. And I was already like face-palming about like, Oh, we're about to do this all over again. And that was the 1920s, right? We still had a number of financial bubbles ever since. And so it's interesting to take the position of a historian and an author and a researcher when looking at these things. And I'm wondering if you could just like, I don't know, audit the human species, the human society as like our ability to navigate these interest rates and speculative bubbles in financial markets. How much have we been able to learn from our ancestors in lessons of old? Because it seems to me, not much.
  Speaker 3
  Are we getting any better at this? Are we getting any better?
  Speaker 1
  It's pretty sad. I think we're getting actually a great deal worse. Oh, no. First of all, I mean, it's a plastitute to say that human psychology doesn't change. Jim Grant, your financial journalist historian, I think he says somewhere that in science, engineering progress is linear. Whereas in finance, it is cyclical. We learn from our mistakes as a society and individually. So that's fair enough. But why might things be getting worse, which is problematic? ([Time 1:02:08](https://share.snipd.com/snip/41475ab9-66da-4ee5-b94a-85b4d342299b))
    - **Note:** Human nature doesn’t change while science may be linear finance is cyclical
- The Everything Bubble and Career Risk in Investing
  Key takeaways:
  - The U.S. stock market was at its highest valuation by the end of 2021.
  - The cyclically adjusted price earnings ratio was the second highest valuation in 2021, after the dot-com bubble.
  - It was difficult for investors not to get sucked into the bubble due to career risk and underperformance if not invested.
  - Career risk is the biggest driver of markets according to Jeremy Grantham from GMO.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And by the end of 2021, by the end of the everything bubble, the U.S. Stock market, as you probably know, was at the highest valuation on any number of different valuation measures. But let us stick with the cyclically adjusted price earnings ratio, sometimes called the Shiller B.E. After Robert Shiller, who collects the data at Yale. And what you see is that that was the second highest valuation of the U.S. Stock market in 2021, except for the just last gasp of the dot-com bubble. And yet, it was very difficult for an investor not to be sucked into that bubble, because if you didn't get sucked into that bubble, you would underperform and your clients would take their assets away, which is why my old boss, Jeremy Grantham, a GMO, says that the really, he thinks the biggest driver of markets, he's not particularly interested in my whole interest stuff. He thinks the biggest driver of markets is what he calls career risk, which is if you try and battle a bubble, you will be sacked. He often cites a comment of Keynes from the general theory, where Keynes says, in the world of professional investment, it is better to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally. I'm just varying a tiny bit away from the original question. ([Time 1:05:57](https://share.snipd.com/snip/892ef6ed-4bf8-4f94-8b63-bc669f7c306b))
    - **Note:** The biggest risk in investing is career risk and fading that career risk is more dangerous than failing conventionally
