### Highlights

- The Philosophy of Logical Analysis - Philosophy had combined an ethic doctrine on how best to live and a theory of the world these have been linked where people are backsolving based on their ethic instead of using science when these 2 things are very different and shouldn’t be confounded this leads desires to invent arguments instead of just searching for truth. You need to pursue truth. When limits are placed that leads to censorship when we maintain doubt and ignore forcing metaphysics there is no higher way of knowing hidden from us just good investigations we can answer metaphysical questions with logic when we ask the right questions we get closer and closer to the truth base beliefs on observations and inferences divested of bias. Lesson fanaticism increase mutual understanding and empathy.

    - **Note:** Philosophy has a ethic and a worldview. Russell argues that people fit the facts to their inherent worldview bias instead of pursing truth and goodness. We shouldn't let bias consume us but rather seek truth over being right. Use the critical approach use science not bias.
      Critical Approach/ Truth seeking vs being right
- William James - Saw good conduct as what was best. Denied subject object relationship where there is a knowing entity and known entity which was key to philosophy at that point throughout history this was a key philosophical construct. This changes philosophy radically. Only one primal thing that is pure experience this is stuff they experience. Experience requires life you can’t experience the tree falling in the forest thinks experiences create habits. We’re compelled to make a decision when the grounds for making it don’t exist. We have the right to adopt a believing model. Believe truth avoid error. He didn’t really believe in probability just absolutes. Pragmatism is true if it is good for our lives. Pragmatism use what is beneficial for you. Ignore the rest. Obligation to seek truth is to do what is best for us. Believing in god is good for humans so it’s true even if you can’t justify it being real. Substituting belief in god for god.
- John Dewey - Dewey does not see truth as static like a multiplication table, but evolving and growing. Thought as an evolutionary process instead of thought as final. No absolutes all reality is temporal. Truth is based on the mental models and beliefs in the statements not the words actually said. False belief is when you entertain it you are surprised by the wrong outcome. Makes inquiry the subject of knowledge thinks inquiry leads to unified wholes. Truth is the logical outcome of inquiry. Relations of an organism to environment is not only satisfactory when the organism adjust to make the environment more suitable for it that is inquiry. Divides beliefs into good and bad beliefs and this is judged based on the future effects of the beliefs. If you get new information and change, but still fail, that was not truth but if you make those same changes and succeed, then that is truth, even if it’s acting on the same information. Judge belief by effects not causes. Instrumentalist and power over environment. All philosophy deeply shaped by surrounding environment intoxication of power and not checking your pride can lead to madness we need humility.

    - **Note:** Truth is an evolving concept based on mental models and beliefs. Truth is the outcome of logical inquiry. Beliefs are good and bad by their effects utilitarian. We need humility this is instrumentalism and using what works. Change your mind and evolve. Manifest truth
      Knowledge is change and evolution rooted in utilitarianism
- Bergson - Bergson rejected rationalism philosophy is based on methods or results aprori vs realism or idealism. Another way of classifying is the predominant desire which causes the philosopher to philosophize theoretical philosophy spured by love of knowledge feeling inspired by happiness practical philosophy inspired by action happiness is generally religious knowledge based is usually systems related and practical is ones that see action as the main good. Revolt of the man of action. World is split into life and matter and life is always fighting the resistance of matter. Like a man cutting through wind. Splits instinct and intellect intellect is the misfortune of man were instinct is the benefit of bees and ants very industrious. Instinct at its best is intuition. Intellect sees the worlds ends if you are cutting a chicken the intellect sees it as already cut. It’s always looking outwards. Universe is a railway with life going up and matter going down. Intellect is a dream sees things move through space time is the essential characteristic of life. Duration is what life is past slipping future is new. We need to grab the past and bring it into the present this is when we’re truly ourselves it’s perpetual becoming never something made. It’s in memory that duration exists. Memory exists in motor mechanism and independent recollection. One direct recall the other is habit. Memory is inside ourselves and matter exists outside ourselves it’s basically stimulus response. The brain is supposed to limit action as we’re always disposed to action. Human beings are a center of action. We’re free when our acts spring from our whole personality. He doesn’t give reasons for his views just his recommendations. The issue with his philosophy is it’s anti intellectual and illogical so it promotes the intuition over intellect and doesn’t really justify it well. Just wants you to accept his priors without thinking this is dogma he makes illusions to math and science and just assumes things that make errors and point out nothing can be learned through reason and patient worship the ignorant instead of using idea. Action for the sake of action without any contemplation.

    - **Note:** There is practical philosophy and then innate deeper philosophy inspired by root causes and thick desires. Sees the world as matter vs life with life fighting matter. Sees life as a perpetual becoming of taking who we were in the past and dragging that into the present. We must fully bring ourselves into the moment to live our best life. Intuition sees as better than intellect and deep intuition is instinct. Humans are the center of action and when we’re free we’re directing our life springing our personality into the moment. Sees action as the main good in life and philosophy is around action. Brain wants to tamp inhibitions we must counter. This is very much a motion base psychology of taking action for the sake of action and motion.
- Karl Marx - Mark used a scientific approach to economics that looked for the best for the wage earner not from a capitalist point of view. Saw sensation as interaction between subject and object. Truth must be demonstrated in practice. Knower and thing known are in constant evolution we only notice things when we act and do any good theory incorporates action. Marx ethic relies on outputs this is the materialist conception of history. Matter is the driving force and man’s relation to matter the most important part is the mode of production. Culture is the outputs of production and distribution. This is partly true, because philosophy comes from existing within the current power structures in the world. Philosophy split into scientific or logical questions and important, subjective questions with passionate interest but no good info to support either side ie you can’t reason the situation. A philosophy is organic whole of the extra rational decisions. Marx saw classes as part of vehicles of dialectic movement. Believed in the law of progress and it was not dependent on the economic system. Believed in the power of classes.

    - **Note:** Marx believes in a blind law of progress and has a materialist conception of the world. Mans relation to his craft and craftsmanship not mechanist living. Culture as an offshot of production and distribution. Culture comes from the system. Law of progress. His philosophy actually makes a ton of sense from his priors his priors are just wrong. There is no law of progress. If you think it's inevitable you view allocation of resources differently because it's going to happen anyways. Doesn't consider competing incentives of people. He's a blind optimist which doesnt make sense. People grow up wealthy thinking good things just happen to people and become communists but don't realize things take work
- 26. The Utilitarians -
  Wanted to create a social system that would automatically make men happy. Associations of ideas in psychology created the idea of a Pavlovian conditioned reflex. The greatest happiness what is good is pleasure the greatest deeds generate the largest proportion of pleasure to pain. The good is happiness in general and the man pursues what is his great happiness, and the legislator needs the balance, the good of the individual. Wanted laws which aligned incentives of individuals with communities like not stealing because taking is in an individual’s interest utilitarian ethic and community civil law and subsistence abundance security and equality but didn’t care for liberty. Advocated security not war. These people didn’t excuse tradition abolished the death penalty for most crimes as it was used for nearly anything and end up advocating for democracy over aristocracy and repeal of old senseless tradition that didn’t make sense. Only utility is the guide of government thought legislation was beneficent which it hasn’t materialized to be. Believed in just pleasure and pain in his ethic one wholly good one wholly bad. Ethic could’ve been more successful if not for the principle agent problem. Ethic is what is ethical maximizes the most human happiness the ends over the means.
    - **Tags:** #utalitarianism, #trolly-problem, #pleasure-seeking-vs-meaning, #expected-value, #traditions
    - **Note:** Utilitarianism is what maximizes pleasure and minimizes pain. You want to create the most human happiness so you need to balance individual wants with good of society. Trolly problem. Change tradition
- 25. Nietzsche -
  Believed in self reliance and spartan discipline but also in the great individual. Has contempt for women and doesn’t respect them think of them as property objects to Christianity doesn’t view men as equal and supports pride, passion, and war, where Christianity doesn’t. Supports the noble man over the Christian saint who is the will for power. His ideas come from fear nitzche his ethic is aristocratic not individual equality for all. He sees aristocrats as the only people to care about not that rule from aristocrats makes everyone better, but that the lives of everyone, but the aristocrats don’t matter because they’re less than people. Doesn’t believe in love but fear and power. Hates universal love.

    - **Note:** Nitzche believes in the power of agency and power of the Superman who exists above and transcends society as a superior person. This is a power based ethic of greatness but also authoritarian
- 24. Schopenhauer -
  Schopenhauer one vast will. Has a cosmic will which is source of our suffering leads to all progress and progress creates all evils. No such thing as happiness. Argues for nirvana and says the cause of suffering is exercising will the less we exercise will be less we suffer. All things are one and that love connects us.
    - **Tags:** #schopenhauer, #connecting-with-others, #systems-thinking, #universality, #love-core-of-relationships
    - **Note:** Argues against happiness and exercising our will promotes a connected world.
- 22. Hegel -
  Hagel viewed everything as one entity not in parts. Dialectic was thesis antithesis and synthesis. Nothing is wholly false or true his dialectic climbs the world from more to less general you start with a specific idea and rationalize it to the whole then rationalize that whole. The absolute idea is pure thinking about pure thinking. Make general beliefs then raise them in the stack get lather and larger with beliefs to get to the large integrated truth. Reason is the substance of the universe. Sees freedom as wherever law there is freedom. Brining control of the spirit into subjective freedom. The state is an end in itself to be great and one cohesive idea not a way to make men free under a commonwealth doesn’t argue for a League of Nations but states advocating for their interest and if needed starting wars to defend their lives views war as positive. Takes whole over the parts. There is no truth but the whole truth and the truth relies in the whole not its parts. Does the state exist for the citizen or the citizens for the state Hagel takes 2 Locke takes 1. If you say John is the son of James you need to know everything about John and James first to make this declaration and you end up knowing everything about the universe from that one assertion to be true. If enough was known about something all else about that thing could be deduced by logic.

    - **Note:** Hagel was a big very philosophical thinker. Saying you need to understand the whole and rationalize the small to the large. Keeps generalizing thing until it becomes the entire world. This logic is almost an infinite regress in some ways. The state is an end in itself. Whole over parts. Top down logic. Sees the citizens existing for the state
- 20. Kant -
  Knowledge is about ideas perception of agreement or disagreement of 2 ideas. Knowledge is demonstrative sensitive and intuitive. Everyman is an end in itself rights of the individual. Analytical proposition one is known by the subject all tall men are men. Synthetic proposition or everything else. Empirical proposition comes from experience apriori proposition can come from experience but no longer need it like mathematical proofs. Outter world provides sensation and inner world of the mind orders that sensation. Apriori concepts include quantity quality relation and modality. These are applied like space and time not innate in themselves. Antimonies are mutually contradictory propositions. The moral law demands justice and since it doesn’t exist in this life it must in another. He didn’t give a purpose to reason outside the individual it must come innate completely apriori to be considered virtuous you must do things driven by internals not externals. Imperative is the formulation of the command of the reason. Hypothetical and categorical imperative 1. You must do so and so if you want to achieve such end 2. Certain kind of actions are necessary regardless of any end these are apriori. Things you must do because you must do them. Act in only ways that are general laws. Virtue isn’t results based but due to the internal prompting. Every man is an end in themselves. This could be a prompt for democracy but is suspicious of democracy sees world federation for piece. Perception is part internal part external and thinks there is subjectivity even in primary causes. Thinks space and time are apriori. Precepts are caused by thinks in themselves events within the laws of physics.

    - **Note:** Kant was such a big figure in philosophy because he merged the physical and the mental saying some truths are empirical and only seen through experiment while others are apriori mental or innate truths that need no proof. There is moral innate truths that create this categorical imperative that outlines how you should behave from a moral standpoint in a situation in order to do the right thing. There is a moral law that is apriori in situations and that follows the categorical imperative. Process not results based and perception is part internal part external. The mind orders sensation. Analytic vs synthetic proposition
      Merge empirical and apriori and categorical imperative
- 19. Rousseau - Rousseau defended religion not on divinity but awe and morality. He thought the heart was key to religion. Political philosophy everyone gives their rights up to the community. Basically a communist state. Everything must relinquish advantages to be equal. When individual rights run counter to sovereign that everyone pooled their rights the sovereign wins giving people the right to be free. The general will is the deepest common will of the people. There is self interest some benefits you some is in common with others the general will ignores what benefits you to emphasize what benefits all. Man of government has 3 wills personal will will of government and general will. Argued against trade unions or small association for the one big state. Believed city state democracy over rule of kings but elected republic of the smart rich.
    - **Tags:** #communism, #free-will, #will-of-many->-individual, #collectivism-to-individualism, #rousseau, #religion-(awe-of-nature), #individual-liberties, #religion
    - **Note:** defended religion not on the right of god to exist but on how amazing the world is and how difficult that would be to create without a god. He believed in a communist state where people government and the general populus has wills and the only freedom comes by supporting the will of the many but sacrificing the will of each person. The general Will rules all and rule of the intelligent few republic.
- 18. The Romantic Movement -
  Romantic period Was the offshoot of what time after war where people wanted peace, but peace had lasted so long it got too conservative and boring so people wanted more life, more interest, and this lead to pushing down utilitarianism in substitution for aesthetic principles. Substituting earthworm for tigers. Preferred the city to the country. Prefer what is grand violent like Niagara Falls to what is normal and calm like a meadow. Like ghosts and scary stuff not ordinary stuff wanted to think of what was grand. The Romantics wanted strong passions, but strong passions are often negative feelings, so this lead to supporting anarchy. person who is tempted is an archic rebel or tyrant. Strong passions are destructive. Through self interest man has become gregarious but we need to restrain ourselves and forgo plus pleasure in the moment for longer term views. So man has become solitary and needs religion and morality to reinforce self interest. Ignore prudent restraints gain a new energy and power through cessation of inner conflict giving them god like powers mystic becomes one with god or a god and thus lose sense of truth and duty, because that’s what they do they are inherently truthful, and have no duty but themselves. If we could live solitary without labor, we could all experiences independence but because we can’t, it’s left for rulers. World of solitary instincts against social bonds is key to romantic philosophy. Need to balance isolation and contribution to society. This opposes capitalism. Because man is not a social animal, self realization cannot be a core or at the core of ethical principles

      World of solitary instincts against social bonds is key to romantic philosophy. 
      Romantic period was a time of long sustained peace when people started to choose the aesthetic over the practical. They had had it too good for too long and they just loved the safe and boring life. They wanted to mitigate man’s strong passions and believe in random things like ghosts. They sought grand passions and self interest. Man has become solitary and needs a new religion or just general religion for a moral grounding. Pleasure over meaning. The moral relativism causing changes with the times.
      We are living through a second romantic period but this one isn’t of beauty but pure gross excess and status. It is beauty but it’s through luxury goods luxury beliefs and whatever else vanity brings our way.
- 17. Hume - Impression versus ideas impressions have more force and violence every simple idea has a simple impression the complex ideas like a wing horse don’t need an impression. Complex ideas come from impressions from memory and imagination all general ideas come from particular ideas that are abstracted. Theory of ideas. Thinks people are just their perceptions but can’t perceive the self. No man perceive self or have an idea of it. Unperceived things can be defined with perceived things so because we can’t know the self we replace the idea of self with perceptions. Says category of subject and object not fundamental because there is no self just a combination of perceptions. Probablistic knowledge is not things known with a degree of uncertainty but knowledge shrouded in doubt coming from inference from data excludes observation and pure math logic 2 things of probablistic knowledge those that depend on ideas only, 2 and those that can be changed without and change to the idea. Says the first is true knowledge. We can only know cause an effect from observation and experience they’re not inherent in objects or discoverable from them it’s experience that we see things connected. Through association over seee an and b joined we assume they go together what appears as nessecwey connection is only connection within the ideas of objects. Hume is kinda saying correlation doesn’t equal causation past association doesn’t apply future. Hume rejects the idea of causes. Even such that an Apple can’t cause a taste. Mere association. Wanted to prove validity of scientific method, but ended up supposing that we don’t know anything because belief is never rational. Always maintain skepticism kinda creates a backwards thing that nothing we believe can be true because it’s not fully logical consistent. It’s tough to be this extreme because you just reject everything get nothing. Destroys empiricism rejects induction.
    - **Tags:** #probabilitic-thinking, #hume, #correlation-is-not-causation, #nature-of-thought, #skeptics
    - **Note:** Thinks people are just their impressions mainly. Promotes a probabilistic way of thinking. Creates a world of pure ideas like math and a world of stuff where you need to alter your ideas to bring in the new world view. He rejects the idea of causes and correlation not being causation rejects a lot of beliefs really and promotes that knowledge is hard to figure out. Generally very classical skeptical view of knowledge. Perception and reality gap. Theory of ideas is same as particular and general forms really. Says ideas can transcend perceptions.
- 16. Berkeley- Barely we don’t perceive material things only colors and sounds which are in the mind. Has the idea things must be material or mental. Things that can’t be perceived aren’t real but this rules out the idea of unthought of infinite numbers not being real because they haven’t been perceived. The idea of smell of taste are in the mind and things cannot be mental or material. These are secondary qualities. Besides spirits all we know and perceive are our own worlds. Precepts are things we can know without interference. 1. We can allow no inference from our precepts or 2. solipsism we can infer our experiences into other experiences we have and connect them. 3. We can also take what we see and infer people can see something similar that we can’t ie others can feel pain we can’t. 4. There are experiences that I don’t experience and no one else sees ie laws of physics if a tree falls in a forest did it actually fall or was it always on the ground.
    - **Tags:** #perception-shapes-reality, #george-berkeley, #perception-vs-interpretation, #tree-falls-in-forest, #understanding-other's-mental-models
    - **Note:** We only have mental and material perceptions anything we cannot perceive isn't real. This creates issues for infinite numbers and primary/ secondary qualities. We can infer but cannot feel others feelings
- 15. Locke's Influence - Liebnotz has a logic principle that creates a vast array of deduction where Locke grounds in observable facts and grows from there this makes leibnetz ideas fall if there is logical inconsistency anywhere. Locke thought of answering questions in a vacuum each on their own merits not trying to make a perfect system apriori. Enlightened self interest led more happiness that ideas of loyalty
    - **Tags:** #bottoms-up-and-top-down, #bottoms-up-not-top-down, #locke, #liebnitz, #complexity, #study-problems-not-fields
    - **Note:** Locke faced problems in themselves not starting with a world view and trying to fit the problem in. This likely makes his life easier because bottoms up is easier than top down.
- 14. Locke's Political Philosophy -Historically believed that kings right came from Adam and Eve. Power in the state comes from king aristocracy and middle class. 2-3 combine against the other to assert power. Political dynasty doesn’t pass down but economic dynasties are passed down. State of nature and natural law doesn’t come from hereditary. Natural law creates leize fair and rights of man. All free subjects are free to inherent land and free exercise of industry and domicile. Everyone by the light of nature will do what gives him the greatest advantage and him pursuing this will lead to the best ev for society. Men living together without a superior judging them is a state of natures. Locke took old ideas that were too before their time and catalyzed them brought them to the forefront and got credit for creating them. Men are free and equal to do what they want as far as the laws of nature not subordinated to any. Law of nature implies you can’t harm someone else because that violates gods nature and we’re all gods property. Freedom of self determination but can’t fuck with anyone’s shit. Men can defend themselves of thieves but once they get away the government has to deal with it. Property rights are key to government right acts promote the most general good. Locke believed rule wasn’t Devine but a result of a social contract between the people and rulers. Argues against absolute government and for checks and balances between executive and judiciary. Believed in the labor theory of value that people have the right to the property they create. Lockes ideas on checks and balances are played out in the us through the constitution
    - **Tags:** #equality-and-freedom, #defending-rights, #rules-for-rulers, #locke, #liberal-mindset, #checks-and-balances, #class-differences, #synthesis-vs-process, #divine-right, #self-determinism, #property-rights, #freedom, #dynasties, #favorite, #right-time/place
    - **Note:** Divine right of kings now power comes from the state with classes that each have their rights which means no political dynasty but still can be economic dynasties. Strong property rights. Everyone is free to self determination and free under nature to do what is best for them. There is no superior judge. Locke was the right time and place for these ideas which were widely held but never synthesized and right for the current time. Men are free and equal to do what nature allows them. Self determination without fucking anyone else. Rule is a social construct believed in checks and balances and people own what they create. Strong property rights and men can defend what is theirs
- 13. Locke's Theory of Knowledge - Locke was the right man at the right time this ideas had immense government support right time and place he put practicality above dogmatism. Truth is hard to obtain so we hold our ideas with doubt held reason over all even religion. Reason is what we know with certainty and our probablistic conjectures. Don’t believe without knowledge but hold ideas lightly don’t impose them. Founded empiricism all knowledge comes from experience we learn through sensation and our mind’s perception the mind knows nothing apriori knowing through sense was new. All things exist in particulars but we can group many particulars into a general concept like man that are applicable to many things. We have intuitive knowledge of our self demonstrative knowledge of god and sensitive knowledge of the world. All simple ideas are evident and complex ideas are made of simple ideas so knowledge comes from intuition reason sensation. Tough to have a system that is logically true and self consistent. Believed pursuing happiness is the grant of freedom and the greatest pleasure is pursuit of happiness. We value pleasure today more than tomorrow interest rate of pleasure. Prudence is the long term general good of self that makes you act positive ev and rationally at all times linked with the idea of saving due to investment investing for the future. Private and public interest are the same in the long run but not the short run so being pias and prudent leads to virtue because god sees all so people just be good otherwise you need laws. Property rights are important mixed with liberty that is limited by the government

    - **Note:** Locke was the right person at the right time for his ideas. Believes in both innate knowledge and sensory knowledge. Founded critical empiricism and put progress in front of dogmatism. Hold beliefs, lightly everything exist in specifics and generalities. Simple ideas make up complex ideas. Believed in pursuit of happiness and individual freedoms. Alignment of private and public interests are the same it’s just long vs short term time delay that causes a perceived misalignment
- 12. Philosophical Liberalism - Political liberalism was the rise of the individual where people were able to have their own opinions and disagree show evidence and come to an answer and be free to do so unlike justified true belief which was the church’s rule.
    - **Tags:** #opinion-(do-the-work), #justified-true-belief, #liberal-mindset, #independent-thinking, #critical-approach-(conjectures-and-refutations)
    - **Note:** Liberalism was independent thinking based on evidence.
- 11. Leibniz - He believes in an infinite number of substances called monads unlike others who believed in 1 god or 3 mind matter and soul. Every monad influences the universe but there really all independent souls. The body is made of monads and the mind directs the lower monads this is basically aggressive free will every small space has a monad that is acting in some way. Ontologic argument is the most perfect perfection. Cosmological argument is that of first cause or unmoved mover. Leibniz says everything has a reason so the core reason for giving is god. God created not the best world but the best possible world doesn’t argue god in infallible. Substance comes from idea of subject and predicate. Substances must be always a subject and persist through time. He wanted to replace thinking with calculation mathematical philosophy he didn’t publish his work because it conflicted with Socrates and he thought it was wrong and because he was worried about the world’s reaction. Based his philosophy on the law of contradiction and sufficent reason. Contradiction says all analytic propositions are true sufficient reason says all true propositions are analytic if you make a journey that journey is apart of you. You can deduce everything from the subject from the quality of king Alexander was you can deduce he would be Darius and die young. Every predicate comes from the subject t. This says free will is a myth determined by god. Composibles 2 things that can exist probablisticly but not together like heads and tails.

    - **Note:** Liebnitz had an atomist theory where all things were made of monads. Had aggressive free will with god at the center. Unmoved mover. God tried to create the best world but isn’t perfect so evil exists.
      Believes in aggressive deduction and no probablistic thinking. Just based on essential nature of Alexander and Darius you could assume he would win. But then his essential nature predisposed him to die early. Aggressive determinism. Were nature vs nurture. Path dependence is clear and deterministic always vs being up to chance.
      Analytic philosophy
- 10. Spinoza - In a state of nature there is no right or wrong because there are no laws in nature. Sovereign can do no wrong opposed to rebellion believes in state over church. Holds freedom of opinion. Believes in no free will. Wanted to find a life dedicated to the good. Finite Things are determined by boundaries what they are not all people are trying to get closer to god that’s immortality oneness with god. Sees no such thing as evil just a lack of mortal knowledge to see gods good grace. We are free due to our internal locus of control and how self determined we can be an in bondage when at the mercy of outside causes. All wrong action is intellectual error and everyone seeks self preservation. Sees past present and future as all one thing because of no self determinism so thinks an ill done in the past is as bad a one tomorrow. He wants to liberate men from fear so they don’t fear death but embrace life. What comes from within can’t be bad only. When a man grasps the external world and the whole he is free. He rejects passions where we are passive to outside forces. He who understands himself loves god. Spinza shows us how to live nobility within the limits of human power. We can’t be immortal so we can’t fear death or else we’re a slave don’t fear death but take everything to avoid death. He believes in loving your neighbor all ills are caused by insufficient knowledge and only love can drive out hate. Sees the world as a larger system of causes and effects and we’re all just a piece of the larger whole.

    - **Note:** Spinosa believes in the wide world and were a piece of it, and all evil is caused by insufficient knowledge. No free Will things are determined by their boundaries. supreme agency of man, despite not living with free will. He believes in internal locus of control and freeing yourself from the external world. What events come come, and you just must embrace them. Live Noble within your human powers to do so. Liberate yourself from fear.
- 9. Descartes - Descartes split mind and matter. Cartesian doubt is doubting everything you can possibly doubt questioning first principles we can doubt physical things but we know we think so we have a mind so we know we exist so I think therefore I am is the kernel of his philosophy and theory of knowledge he makes mind more certain than matter. And your mind better than others. He didn’t invent this but understood it as fundamental to a new theory of knowledge. Separates the soul from the body as something real idea of the mind and though is the basis for the theory of knowledge today. All things are subjective in this idea. Ideas are innate come from outside or are invented by us. Sees our ideas about things like the sun better than our external perception the world of the mind better than body. Then proves god I’d really and good this the external world is real because god wouldn’t deceive us. Brought dualism of mind and matter together and stood in the importance of thought above all. Was a Cartesian and didn’t believe in free will just determinism
- 8. Hobbes' Leviathan- Hobes life is nasty brutish and short humans want freedom but to have safety must give this up and submit to a ruling power. The leviathan is the power of the collective vested in one entity usually a commonwealth or king. Sovereign is in control but his interests are allotted with the people so his incentive is to be good. Monarch create property rights or at least states do and prevent anarchy. He doesn’t hide truth because it will hurt his rule. The people prefer him to chaos. Thinks monarchy is the best but the representative government in his day was hereditary. Liberty removes all impediments to motion. Sovereign have and makes the laws. Men are subject to the sovereign except they hold the right of self preservation. Believed in absolute state power. Dangers are faced by anarchy and despotism and checks and balances in our best solution so far. He believes anarchy is the worst so pushes for a state but things swing and sometimes you need anarchy. Promotes universal government

    - **Note:** Hobbes is anti anarchy and pro order he thinks people should all best their power in one entity which he believes should be a king but this power comes from the people. Property rights over chaos. Men are subjugated to the sovereign laws expect for self preservation. He's anti anarchy so hes pro very authoritarian stuff because the state of chaos in nature is so bad. Create strong incentives but still monarchy
- 7. Francis Bacon - Bacon invented inductivism. Saw knowledge is power mastery over nature through science. Believed people should both collect and arrange data. Fought against idols bad habits of mind. Based in human nature, personal prejudice, tyranny of words difficult of escaping from those over our mind, received system of thought, blind rules can take the place of judgement habit the cave the market place theater the schools
- 6. The Rise of Science -Science is not what someone believed, but wow why and how someone believe that the evidence the scientific belief was new to the world that had previously just had no scientific grounding just astrology. 2 merits immense, patience, and great boldness were the big qualities of this time. Before this no one had both, and Copernicus knew all that could be known using his materials about the heavens. What changed there was a benefit of simplicity making theories more simple better science. Two big things were what had previously been believed, could be false. And progress came from collecting a facts patiently and testing of theories. And bold conjectures that combine facts. Kepler discovered more of patients and analysis of data than genius. changing the motion of planets from ellipses to circles change the idea that these were perfect things as the circle was a perfect shape into something that was more realistic. This changed the frame of thinking. Dial came up with the idea of falling bodies at the same speed. The mob was all the professors of philosophy and their dogmatism, and hated the telescope, because it showed more heavenly bodies than the assumed seven which was a perfect number. The idea of law was in men’s head, and sorcery was dismissed. The unmoved mover was cut out by laws of motion pushing god out of the thinking. Newton believed in absolute space and time we believe in relativity now.

    - **Note:** Science and the rise of science was for the where why and how. It only came about because of patient collection of data and bold conjectures. It distilled carefully collected facts into simple theories. The mob couldn’t reject the obvious.
- 4. Erasmus and More- Happiness best is achieved by brutes not men of reason because it’s easier to imagine yourself a king become one. Said religion comes from folly and true religion comes from the heart not head. Men of the renaissance were incredibly curious and would only take curiosity from books but later would take interest in real people this is the change from pure literary based into the real world and scientific. Some times favor men of intellectual others men of action. More invented the idea of Utopia a place in the southern hemisphere, where everything is done the right way and perfect. In Utopia, all things are held in common and cannot flourish with private property. Without communism there can be no equality. Everyone can enter house no ownership. Government is a representative democracy’s or the smartest men. Everyone eats in halls together. Teach contempt of money and they raise an army they display courage when necessary but view war practically. Believe in usually one god but many religions. Moores beliefs are very liberal when it comes to war dealing with criminals ie no death penalty religious tolerance but no diversity.
    - **Note:** More was preaching utopia and a lot of progressive ideas the issue with utopia is it always looks like communism. Brutes more likely to become great because men of action will trump men of words
- 3. Machiavelli - Machiavelli saw religion as an important social cement. Thought church’s evil actions undermined religion and the closer people were to the church the more curropt they were. He admired skill and cunning. He help skill and unity both in his mind so he respects people who did bad things well but doesn’t admire them. He says that people need to be cunning not always do what is good. Keep faith when it works but then also be faithless. Convince the people of your faith and use the rules that work for you not necessarily principled. It’s not important to have conventional virtue but important to project you have them. Believed in the balance of power. Balance of powers. Political liberty needs personal virtue. Love of liberty and checks and balances can’t from antiquity and stood to this day. Power comes from a man’s ability to seize it there is no Devine power and popular governments are better than divine ones because they need to consider the people political goods are national independence security and well ordered constitution a constitution doles out power relative to that persons status ie noble people common people fir stability skew toward more people. Means are important it’s stupid to try something you think will fail you must choose means adequate to achievement there are no morals other than the goal and it’s good to study sinners and saints. Just about the science achieving success and it’s about power. The idea of virtue helps cement power. Controlling the narrative is vital. Politicians behave better when the people want virtue and news is open.

    - **Note:** Machiavelli believed in ends over means he had personal beliefs of balance of powers and equality and religion as social cement but ultimately if you could get the thing done it mattered very little how you got that done. Virtue signaling was important and keeping up appearances with the people was vital but ultimately terrible people do great things and great people do nothing sometimes and he was focused on great things with the signaling of being a great person but just putting outcome over process.
- 1. General Characteristics -Religion gives an out of the box worldview while science gives no clear picture just conjectures in different areas. Theoretical science vs practical science. The benefit of science to the world led to more practicality and less theory. More individualism. Science while it enables individualism but needs more collectivism than ever. We’ve become to opposed with process over outcome. Justified true belief was important before the renaissance. Later in this time the pope become power focused. The renaissance didn’t foster a ton of thought but broke down barriers that restricted thought which set the table also dug up the greats reading Plato direct and learning became a great adventure not solving for a predetermined outcome which fostered free thought. Renaissance was mostly rich benefactors funding art. When the emancipation from the church happened people opened up to crazy beliefs not necessarily rational but astrological and morally the world took a step back because there was no moral code. Instability and individualism are a pair the more you have of one the more you get of the other.
- 14. Franciscan Schoolmen- 4 courses of ignorance frail and unsuitable authority influence of custom opinion of unlearned crowd concealment of ignorance in apparent wisdom this creates all evil. Individuation with individual things some aspects are essential other ancillary a man wearing a hat the hat in ancillary. Ocams razor choose the answer that makes fewer assumptions all other things equal. Logic is an instrument for the analysis of nature an instrument of discursive science. Science is about things logic is about universals science uses universals but logic deals with them. Logic deals with things fabricated by the mind within itself a word has both a thing and deeper meaning and we must differentiate between the uses to make sense. Terms that point at things are terms of 1st intention terms that point at terms are terms of second intention refer to science vs logic.

    - **Note:** Weak and bad authority. Uneducated masses. Fake intelligence to hid ignorance all evil. Use simplest explanation. Science is about particulars and logic universals. Proximate and root cause in first and second intentions.
- 11. The Twelfth Century - The 12th century had crusades which established and deepened the power of the church and killed Jews that allowed Christian’s to usurp them as merchants and killed them in mass. The scholastics catalyzed the 13tj century into the renaissance these people pushed things forward but relied on reasoning and words even when experiment and action were needed which was a flaw. People were at times still debating the same problems 40 years later this isn’t progress it’s just being happy not making process. The 13th century was the birth of the inquisition and fighting in the church. This was rebuffed but only for a few centuries strong men kept the church together only for the church to finally collapse in the 16th century. People saw missionaries and the opinion of the church was saved. St Francis lived poor and wanted to genuinely help people was a rich kid gave up all possessions but this didn’t last as his successors didn’t commit to poverty only feigned it and the order collapsed became surface level. The issue with catholic philosophy is that it had an answer it was solving for which limited thought
- 10. Mohammedan Culture and Philosophy - The Muslims when they conquered generally kept ruling places in order and recognized Jews and Christians as people not to be persecuted when they took over a charged smaller taxes, and generally were less strict and people welcome that and often there was very little resistance, who there expansion. Avi senna big philosopher and did a lot in medicine. He believed thought brings about generalities in forms. He may not have believed strongly in universals. Universals are before things in things and after things. God creates the idea for cat then the animals are embedded with this concept in their natural cat like nature then we form the idea of cats in our mind. The Muslims philosophy was starting to become vibrant but got crushed by a ruler into rigid orthodoxy. This led to less interpretation and just reading the book as it is. So they proposed taking the book literally and there was more downside than upside to expanding on this thought. Bad incentives. Everoise fought against the dogma of literalism preached and said that the books passed philosophical truth through allegories. The Muslims didn’t like speculation outside of the holy book because it held all truth. Russell saw the Muslim ideas not as an important creator of knowledge but a good transmitters of knowledge that kept the Greek ideas alive and passed down so they could be picked up for the renaissance.

    - **Note:** Muslim culture started out as more open but became very rigid in their adherence to the book which stunted intellectual growth and rigor. They were good preservers of history but bad creators of knowledge because there was no incentive to create knowledge either try and possibly get killed or just keep your head down so most people did. Universals god has a cat perfected form then cat examples. Orthodoxy rigidity and dogmatism. Open minded emergence and self organization allows for knowledge to form.
- 6. St. Benedict and Gregory the Great - The most effective men of action are often intellectually second rate. Times were difficult but confusion offers great opportunities to able statesmen. This allowed Gregory to exercise some authority. Celibacy was part of the moral superiority of the church but this belief and ideal created and held the churches power above men. Ontological object saw god as the greatest object of thought which much exist somewhere default has to be a greatest therefore god exists. Is there anything that we can think of that by virtue of us thinking it can exist outside our thought. Philosopher dream. Then there is a bridge from thoughts to things. Sees reason as below faith. He believes to understand.

    - **Note:** Men of action may not be as smart. Difficult times create opportunity right initial conditions for initiative individual. Subordinates reason to faith. By virtue of us thinking about something it exists
- 2. Christianity During the First Four Centuries- Christian mixes the material and logical with the metaphysical use reason to establish the faith through god immortality and free will but then also how the profits fortold the messiah. The Christians were intolerant of other religions. Believed in the afterlife in the divine nature of the church. Pure and auster morals and the union and discipline of the Christian republic the novel organization of the Christian’s as a voting block gave them new power not previously tapped. Ambrose was the priest who helped the church gain administrative power in Europe over the state. View on time. Time created when the world is created no before or after but an eternal present. Gods eternity is always present. God stands outside time. St Augustine explains time the present is all that can be measured and time does pass. Only the present really is but there is past and future. Sees past and future as present by calling past memory and future expectation. It’s a bit of a juxtaposition. Present of things past memory of things present sight and of things future expectations. Time is subjective and in the human mind. There can be no time without a created being. He also anticipated I think therefore I am understanding that self realization is a proof of being. He attached intent and understanding to sin in reference to rape and sacking. Also created the concept of the city of mortals and city of god. The power of the city of god is it declared the separation of church and state and the state could only be part of the church by being subservient to it in religious matters. This has been the policy of the church since. The weakness of the state allowed the church to grab power.

    - **Note:** The church gained power at a time of weakness of the state where an organized block was able to conquer and take control with good administration. Used intolerance as a way to spread hegemony and morals to take the high road. Admin power. Create power from unusual places like Robert Moses.
      Idea of time present was all there is and relative to observer past and future were special conditions of present one is memory the past in the other expectation the future.
- 1. The Religious Development of the Jews - The Jews innovation was a sole god and the inability to worship idols previously when people were taken over they assumed the conquerors religion the Jew remained separate and wanted to prevent the intermarriage of their group with other groups. Jewish morality was fairly basic do well to your neighbors giving charity have god on your side. Treat slaves not too well or poorly. Be strict with kids. Jews were killed for their beliefs and this led to the idea of a heaven so not all virtue on earth but also in a higher world could justify sacrifice here. The Jews were becoming more Hellenized and there was great incentive to do so but the few that held out set the table for Christianity and Islam. Jews were similar to the Stoics in their philosophy and stood resolutely in the face of torture. The Jews thought their opponents would never be forgiven and go to hell not a forgiving god. The idea of loving the lord and neighbor and seeing hatred as evil. When you study the letter of the law you hurt the ability to innovate and create new philosophy you’re too stuck with technical debt. Jews once Christianity came to power persecuted Jews and prevented them for doing anything the Muslims were generally more accepting and Jews were integrated into those cultures. After the Middle Ages the Jews lost their cultural unity and were stuck to be individual contributors but not a cultural movement/ race. Christianity started as a sect of Judaism Circumsicdon and diet restriction kept Judaism from spreading far/ mainstream.

    - **Note:** Judaism had a simple morality and them being the out group they were persecuted for being different and not conforming which got them killed and led them to invent ideas like heaven to help their believers.
- 29. The Roman Empire in Relation to Culture - The Greeks and Roman’s lost their metal and creativity. The Greeks were conquered and dispirited the Roman’s ruled but excess bled into their rule and eventually the army only took bribes and never fought everything was backward and they got over powered by barbarians. The empire split and the East was alive until 1400s through the Constantine decree on Christianity being adopted while different groups ruled the Christian through line and Greek culture remained more or less honored through the years until the conquest but the western side outsourced fighting to barbarians and made the poor serfs while this worked well for a century the incentive alignment over the long run led it to blow up. Unmotivated citizens led to little innovation. The Roman’s were previously farmers but then adopted Greek culture almost fully. They created little new. People grew rich had grand estates divorce rose morals decayed. Rich had fewer Children. People read and learned less didn’t care as much about culture focused more on military co quest and taking than learning. Romes size allowed culture to permeate through the empire. The vibes of a growing vs shrinking empire are different. In a growing pie there is hope and vigor even with fewer resources in a shrinking environment there is fear of further loss. Humans are relative beings.

    - **Note:** This is how empires fall and a drift in performance overall. There was bad incentive alignment people saw the world as fixed, not growing, and started to take from the pie instead of creating and adding to it. The army was given so much power and outsourced and eventually they just took over. Humans are relative beings that look for growth. Similar idea in mass movements. Unmotivated people don’t create change. Eventually all systems must create. People need motivate hope and growth.
- 28. Stoicism - Stoicism pursuing a life of virtue. Cosmic determinism and no such thing as chance. Believes history was cyclical everything his existed and will exist again history repeats. Everything has a purpose that helps human live and realize their being. Directing will and living within nature. Virtue is in the will which is entirely in the individual so everyone has the chance to be virtuous if they ignore unimportant, external things. Virtue is the end in itself not an earthly good. This takes the idea that you shouldn’t be sad or offput by family death or friends he does good ti be virtuous preached universal love. Freedom from the daily ins and outs to just be resolute and steady in all situations and act with virtue. Brotherhood of man living with nature. The idea of stoicism that nothing in the outside world can effect you yet you have full free will. Virtue and sin are a result of previous causes. Ultimately it creates an ideal life that has some life philosophy that is seen in a perfected state but implemented in an imperfect world so it’ll never be right. Stoics came up with the idea of certain things and probabilistic guesses given facts. They believed in innate ground truth principles this underlies ideas like natural laws and equality of man. Ground truths. Created natural law

    - **Note:** Living a virtuous life which was an internal focus not an external. You can’t control events but you can control your reaction. Every life has a purpose and essential nature and you must live with yours. Cycles in life and history. Virtue is an internal thing and choosing virtue and happiness is the key. Brotherhood of man treat all situations with even keel feelings. Live with the purpose nature set for you. Ideal life ground truths and essential laws. Universal love.
      Perception vs interpretation life purpose/ virtuous life. Separation between action and reaction. Cycles in history innate truths.
- 27. The Epicureans - Epicurious believed in pleasure as the guiding course in life and the pursuit of them but also believed in keeping a simple diet and being resolute in death as he was. His teaching once made were fixed and unchanging. Dynamic pleasures consistent the attainment of a desired end like eating, and static pleasures are that desired and state like the state of feeling full. Static is a state of equilibrium. Regards absence of pain than gluttony. He thought better to eat to be not hungry than eat to be full. Believed in common sense and minding your own business not great philosophical doctrines. Believed all men were focused on selfish pleasures but also in friendship and the power of it. Was focused on avoiding fear and death. Hated and rejected religion very hostile religion in the old times could’ve been different for different peoples like rich and poor that we don’t have good info on poor people in history so we don’t fully understand their lives. believed in materialism and rejected mortality and this was very different from Christianity so non existence as a deliverance.

    - **Note:** Epicurious believed in pleasure to guide him. Moral systems are a reflection of a small subset of rich educated people of the times and may not reflect society. Static vs dynamic pleasures. Thought doing something to avoid that bad was better than over pursuing the good. Selfish pleasures but importance of relationship avoiding fear/ not having it.
- 26. Cynics and Sceptics - The cynics rejected every convention known to man took the other side of any authority or idea. Rejects external goods only for internal virtue. Indifference to good things. Skeptics there was no idea more right or wrong in any school so you could just adopt whichever one you were closet to do really no critical thinking about philosophy said people were pretending to knowledge the issue is that they’re dogmatic in the idea that knowledge was impossible. This was a good idea for a time of deep unrest that gave comfort in everything being bs and no truth. Degrees of probability were invented at this time.

    - **Note:** Cynics rejected all things for internal virtue saw no things as good or evil. Took the other side and rejected things for sport.
      Skepticism saw nothing as better or worse everything was just someone opinion they were dogmatic in the relativity of knowledge. Everyone was pretending to knowledge and true knowledge was impossible this was a time of deep unrest and the fact that everything was bs gave people comfort. Was right for the time and place of hopelessness.
- 25. The Hellenistic World - The conditions for revolution need to be right when the Roman’s took over much philosophical progress was halted environment was just not conducive to it. Environment shapes behavior and waves. Alexander started to create the concept of a more global world. Alexander created the idea of unity instead of city states but it decayed after his death back to original structures. At Alexandria the people were just as great but discovered fewer universal truths due to them being specialists instead of generalists like the older Greeks. There was no clear order and everyone was at the mercy of conquests making less global universal truth due to life uncertainty. There was no great structure post Alexander so people took up faith and comquesting land instead of growth of science and economy. Idea was to avoid misfortune than to do good. People could think but they couldn’t imagine implementing their thoughts.
- 22. Aristotle's Logic - His logic was through sylagisms with major and minor premises and a conclusion. Aristotle used inductive reasoning but thought it was deductive. Yiu cant learn by deduction only induction. What he didn’t understand was that assuming all men are mortal is false because some men have yet to die so this is inductive not deductive. What moves everything from a physical point of view is will. The nature of something is the end it exists for. Things have an internal principal of motion which means change of quality or size not just movement. Alive things have an internal principal of change nature is of form not matter. They had the idea that the world revolved around the earth and space was heaven. Very advanced geometrically. The Ancient Greece had a concept we weren’t at the center of our universe. Discovered 24 hour day. Invented Copernicus hypothesis even though it was strongly against the religion and tenuous.
    - **Tags:** #syllogism, #logic, #inductivism, #arisdotle, #ends-(things-exist-for-ends), #internal-principal-of-motion, #free-will
    - **Note:** Syllogisms were his logical process big then little idea to conclusion. Logic was more inductive than deductive but he didn’t realize that. All things in nature exist for an end. We are moved by an internal will. Internal principal of motion.
- 20. Aristotle's Ethics - Friends can only be made wiry those of the same standing a good men must love themselves to be friends with themselves wicked men cannot love them selves. Pleasure is distinct from happiness but you can’t have happiness without pleasure. Some pleasure is needed for happiness and not all pleasures are wholly bodily. Pleasure is subordinate to things like intelligence that we should seek progress over pleasure at points pleasures are connected with reason. Pleasure is contemplative happiness lies in contemplation and virtuous perfect activity leasure is necessary to happiness. Delight in reason and contemplation that is the key to happiness and virtue. Questions about ethics 1. Is it internally consistent 2. Is it consistent with authors views 3. Does it gives answers to ethical problems that are consonant to our ethical feelings. We can rely on old ideas for ethics because unlike astronomy we haven’t really made ethic progress just movement so they are not more right than us. Purpose governs development due to the idea of final causes virtuous actions are those to lead to better organization and form. He had the idea that everyone has a sphere of happiness and some are bigger than others if they’re wealthier but they’re entitled to that sphere of happiness. Absence of benevolence or philanthropy. Best way to prolong tyrany is to create a shared enemy and keep people busy or make yourself a god. Thought citizens wouldn’t work just leasure and governance. Don’t teach slaves.

    - **Note:** You need to be friends with those who are equal to you and you can only love others once you love yourself. Pleasure is distinct from happiness, but you can’t have happiness without pleasure. Pleasure is a lower form of happiness. Happiness is in contemplation and leisure and boredom is vital to happiness. Ethics need to be consistent and we haven’t made much progress in ethics recently. Purpose governance development. Everyone has a max capacity of happiness, information capacity of happiness. The best way to prolong tyranny is to have others live a distracted life.
- 20. Aristotle's Ethics - The good is happiness Human soul is 2 parts rational and irrational. Intellectual and moral and virtues. Reason is contemplative and doesn’t lead to any action alone. Intellectual comes from teaching moral from habits the legislature makes the people good by forming good habits and other just virtues. By being compelled to have good habits we will eventually form them. Every virtue is a mean between 2 extremes that are both vices. This is the golden mean balancing modesty between bashfulness and shamelessness. He also has a class breakdown where the acting of a man to another man is different than his wife or slave who cannot act certain ways toward him and ways he acts towards them aren’t wrong because they’re his property. He has this magnoamous man who is the perfect example of the perfect mean. Issues with this is it’s only written for aristocratic people not everyone can achieve this. It’s written for the a few great men and isn’t believed to be achievable by anyone like stoicism or Christianity which allows everyone to achieve goodness and virtue. Subordinates ethics to politics to have a great community over heart men. We have this in our western leaders expected to be above the average man. We’re not to blame for things we can’t do. Virtue is the avoidance of sin where we can’t expect unrealistic things from people but Aristotle doesn’t believe that and takes the absolute view of moral virtue virtues are means to ends. Intellectual virtues are ends but practical virtues are means. Virtue is action that produces the goods. Virtues belong to the whole in individual.
- 19. Aristotle's Metaphysic- Aristotle had substances and universals a substance is a this a universal is a such. A universal cannot exist in itself but only particular things like there is only football because there are footballers the dependence of an adjective is based on its proper name but not vice versa the men who played football would still exist without football. Russell rejects this because man would still need a job if it wasn’t football. The difference is between proper nouns and relation words. This may be semantics but developed the world of ideas. He also created the idea of the escense of things this is what you are by your very nature and groups like species have this too, and if this was removed, you would lose your unique individuality. Has the idea of form and matter. Material vs form. Marble is the material the statue is the form the soul is the form of the body. Form gives unity to matter it’s is essence and primary substance they don’t make the form as much as they don’t make brass. 3 forms sensible and perishable then the 3 permutations of the 3. 4 causes material - marble formal essence of state to be produced efficient chisel making contact and final the end the sculptor has in view. Irrational soul is personal beliefs like love of oysters and rational mind is universal truths like math that is god like perfect.

    - **Note:** Substance vs universals Universals are things in it's essential nature which don't actual exist but is the thing you associate with a topic like your ideal bird may not exist and then substances are specific examples like this bird. The substance doesnt depend on the universal but the universal is the example and needs substances. A footballers still exists without the universal football.
      Esence of things are what you are at your nature which is bad of many substances and when you remove these you lose who you are. This is your personality matrix and unique differentiation
      form vs matter the matter is the physical stuff and the form is the representation. There are different forms from the shaping of the sculpture to the highest form which is the end of the art in the mind of the sculpture. Ultimate end highest order bit
      Rational truths are universal truths while the irrational soul is your personal beliefs
- 16. Plato's Theory of Immortality - Socrates saw life as something lived through the physical body but apart from it and above it not giving in to daily pleasures but just living above them. Able to drink as much as possible but never be too drunk. The body blocks our thought of true knowledge when in company with the body the soul can’t have true knowledge believed the soul was freed in death and the afterlife was generally better. Thought all knowledge was passed from the after life. Souls existed before birth. The pure soul after death passes on to the afterlife while the inpure soul goes into an animal. Plato had the idea of creation the world made of 4 elements time and space + eternal archetype mix of necessity and purpose in the world. Knowledge isn’t what is becoming but what is one judgement can’t be truer but better. A wise man is a better judge of the future like a doctor vs layman. The world is always changing and in flux. Knowledge can’t be through perception but must include thinking. We can’t know through senses knowledge consists in reflection not perception knowledge is judgements of perception. Mathematical truth exists without perception through symbols
- 15. The Theory of Ideas - Good creative work requires walking every path of a mountain before stepping back and seeing it wholly. Need to see the necessities of reason and understanding one is ideas in motion with hypothesis it can’t test like in math the other is pure ideas. We need super sensible straight lines in a super linear world. Plato established the idea of objective truth and ultimate form but struggles at times to merge this with examples or particulars like man vs a man. The cave is the idea of the world being illuminated to someone one. That we go through the world blind and illuminate it to ourselves only at times we must use our soul to shine truth onto the world but this is our point of greatest confusion because we open up a bigger world. Struggled with the idea of manyness and the idea that opinion and reality must inhabit different worlds. There are a world of things and form doesn’t explain why god would do both though. Plato creates crazy questions that guide metaphysiccal thinking which are good if they’re disposed of correctly. Plato created the idea of beauty in science which guided it well until it was disproven but people didn’t move on fast enough.

    - **Note:** We live in the cave and as we walk down different paths of knowledge to see the overall mountain of knowledge present in the world we become more informed and illuminate the cave more. Take the wider perspective. We are blind until we use our soul to shine truth on the world. Plato struggles with rationalizing the general and particular. He asks crazy questions which open up his thinking. Blind walk through a forest stuff here
- 14. Plato's Utopia - Justice and government is hard in Plato’s republic because these are arbitrary not definite concepts. Plato’s republic creates rigid culture that stunts art and creation. Ideals vs ordinary object of desire are impersonal not related to the desire of anyone like food then the other is related to personal beliefs. Related to the ego of the person. Ethical disputes create struggle for power to spread propaganda. Justice is the interest of the stronger. Objective truth is impossible but eventually you can accept something is true. Is there ethical fact. Said you can have some ethic ideas of good if it’s widely accepted but you can have non consensus ideas that are true. This rejects one of Plato’s conclusions. Standards and objective fact aren’t true. Knowledge is infallible because it can’t be mistaken but opinion can be mistaken so opinion can be part true part cause opposite characters things can be beautiful and ugly in between being and not being. Opinion is the world of the senses but knowledge is above sense like beauty. He makes a unique argument that things like a cat have an essential nature of cattiness. There are these perfect visions of things like beds then everything wise is an iteration or temporary version of that ideal. Philosophy is the love of wisdom and certainty intense clarity of something then you can see the whole picture.
    - **Tags:** #platos-utopia, #fallability-(of-knowledge), #dynamic-vs-static-systems, #utopia-(issues-with), #plato, #essential-nature, #communism
    - **Note:** Essential nature of things is their purest form a cat vs the ideal of cat seeing the whole picture. Philosophy is the love of wisdom. Plato’s uptopia was very stagnant and communist and the issues Russell has with it is that the world is dynamic and the utopia is a grand place of equality without much hardship but we’re always learning and our knowledge is fallible if everyone is equal no one can really progress. Russell thinks it’s too much the end of history when the world is too dynamic for that. Argues against intellectual hegemony because knowledge is fallible
- 12. The Influence of Sparta - Sparta was a land that was predicated on modesty and a simple life all they had was war and waiting the next generation for war nothing else. There was no philosophy or progress just war. Lycurgus created basically a socialist state in Sparta nazi like that relied on military power and higher birth rate. Saw children as not to a man but to the state and they killed the weak. Spartans had homosexual men and women as normal love. There was no such thing as money or riches. Plato grew up to hate the democracy that had become corrupt and killed his teacher Socrates. Had the idea knowledge isn’t from the senses but by intellect. He created a totalitarian world. Plato said leasure was needed for wisdom. Wanted an oligarchy to run the country. Plato saw 3 classes the common people warriors and overseers. Very small ruling class very rigid. Sees the guardians are a class apart. Wants a culture to create genuine gentlemen and censorship of literature. Wanted the belief in god removal of all negative ideals like cowardice. Sees communism for the guardians and experience of war. No wealth or poverty. Pushed forward eugenics. Outside of the inner circle no one has any power and children are taken away from parents so they never know them everyone is equal.

    - **Note:** The influence on the time is evident in Russell's writing and his immense bias here. Fresh off WW2 with communism on the rise he downplays those aspects of the philosophy and actively rejecting them. Sparta is a miltary power that relied on being a perfect gollum its a weird sort of communism. Athens was a curropt democracy that Russell explains away and argues against the platonic communism. His utopia is a bit dystopian for sure. Many of these are high minded ideals with bad incentive allignment
- 11. Socrates - Socrates idea of life was teaching others to think what he thought and even at his trial he was trying to educate and get the jury to understand his argument. His Socratic method was allowing people to get to his conclusions but this helped him create enemies who thought him vain. He was high minded very sure of himself indifferent of worldly success guided by a Devine voice. Thought clear thinking was right living and thought he was immortal. He was a saint like creature and could get lost thinking for hours. He was a stoic in the way that he believed critics couldn’t harm him and a cynic who despised worldly goods. He was concerns with ethics not science wanted to define ethical terms. Thinks finding knowledge would make men perfect because no one sins on purpose. Socratic method is bad for factual but good for logical ideas to get your thinking out there to expose inconsistencies but can’t create new things.

    - **Note:** Socrates was a teacher through and through which made him friends and enemies who thought he was vain. He was high minded and answered to a higher power. Socratic method bad for facts good for logic. Concerned with ethics not science. He was a stoic in his view of perception vs reality and internals and cynic in his rejection of materialism. Answered to higher power though he was immortal. Thought no one sins on purpose and clear thinking is right living similar to failure only the result of insufficient knowledge this is a moral relativism issue I think.
- 9. The Atomists - The atomists were focused on mechanism not determinism they proved through science not pseudo science. Not focused on theological ideas. There were people who believed in the void and those that argued against it. To some the void was tangible while others it was like happiness in the abstract or to others that happiness needed an objective of the happiness and can’t exist without people. The atomistists created a world of modern day type physics. They saw a place of atoms being unchangeable then voids in between them. The world of the atomists looked at everything from the cosmos to people with wide eyed interest but after this started to be more focused on people and how we knew things not just pushing the frontier of knowledge but investigating the past which lead to the stunting of knowledge. Thought of purpose not just building new knowledge but living in the world of the mind. Took until the enlightenment to gain the vigor of the presocratics for thirst for new knowledge

    - **Note:** The atomists were scientific and investigative. They didn’t only want to investigate nature and be physicist, but they also wanted to investigate the deepest recesses of the mind and humanity. This idea and vigor for knowledge was lost for a while and not recovered until the enlightenment. The idea of the void being reality. Their path to greatness which was rediscovered in society was basically just following their curiosity without bounds. Boundless curiosity is the key to discovery. The loss and recovery shows how important a critical mass of smart people is.
      Atomists were critical curious looked into both human nature and actual nature.
- 7. Athens in Relation to Culture - Athens was built as the product of many neighboring city states giving them money to build a navy and fight the Persians. They parlayed this into being a place of true science democracy and independence. However those in power tried to take too much of the democratic pie and a war with Sparta finished them off. Anaxagoras saw mind as a substance and saw the elements present in all things. He invented the mind and had some advanced cosmic understanding

    - **Note:** Athens had great initial conditions and created a great learning environment but eventually people became power crazy and it collapsed. Invention of the mind
- 5. Parmenides - Parmenediee created some foundational modern logic. He argues that using a word makes it in some sense real and alive but this isn’t true in the actual case. Talking about hamlet doesn’t make him real. After a man dies the meaning of his name changes from something concrete and real to a mental representation of who he was which isn’t fully real. Said the past wasn’t real because when you envoke something like George Washington even if it’s a past memory you’re envoking it now so it’s in the present not the past. While the idea that change doesn’t exists was rejected the idea of substance of a thing being constant or something having a forever substance has lived on.
- 4. Heraclitus - We should in understanding an argument put yourself in the shoes of the argument then try to believe it then after that apply the Utica’s approach. Even if it seems absolutely insane smart people believed that so what do you need to believe to get there what changes for you mentally to believe this obvious false thing and likely you are in the same place with your beliefs obviously wrong where you’re kinda smart on something you believe strongly. Hereclites saw the world in constant flux and opposites as pairs. Thought people had Fire and Water good in evil in balance in them. Believed in war and conflict. Opposites combine to create balance. War common to all strife is justice. Nothing ever is everything is becoming. Eternal life isn’t living forever but living independent of time. Energy replaces matter as what is permanent.

    - **Note:** No one is crazy they see the world different. Smart people can have good reasons for believing something different than you even if that seems insane, so we should try to understand their thought process and what their train of thought is that leads them to this end when it leads us to another. Also recognize you are in the same place with most of your beliefs.
      He saw the world as becoming in constant flux. Everything had a balance and believed in war and conflict. Nothing is. Everything is becoming. Eternal life isn't living forever but living independent of time wow
      This is a great complex topic of smart people being objectively wrong on obvious things and differing views. Good to write about
- 2. The Milesian School - Thales brought geometry and other basic science to the world. The later school saw the world as having one primal substance its infinite eternal ageless encompasses the world. Transformed into various substance. Idea of justice and balance between the substances such that there were balancing loops to keep the world in equal proportions was a core Greek belief. Had an idea that everything evolved from that substance and that even humans evolved from fishes with intermediate steps. Mylesesns had ideas of the world being a cylinder and had different scientific beliefs about air elements and the cosmos. Pythagorean’s were part weird religion part science and geometry. Part mystic part math. He saw all life even animals as sacred and knowledge and property as shared saw the disinterested observer as the peak of humanity seeking truth with no stake. Some people are spectators some are actors in the play then the disinterested investigators sit atop. Pythagoras saw all things as numbers his religion was rooted in part pseudoscience part real science. Pythagoras came up with the idea of going from axioms things we know that are true to conclusions based on those axioms and connections that can then be axioms. Math is a thing that is objectively true the world of thought cleaner than the world of atoms. You can create perfection. These creates idea for objective deep truth in other places like politics but also a great way to structure argument through axioms. Thr idea of objective truth lead to beliefs in Jesus.

    - **Note:** All life is sacred be disinterested, observers, and transcend. Create the idea for objective deep truth in many fields. Developed a lot of the argument and critical approach and had some funny metaphysics.
- Introduction - Philosophy sits in between religion and science with the speculation and conjecture of religion that has not been definitively and logic of science that it appeals to reason. Dogma is theological and truth is science. To understand an age we must understand the beliefs and philosophy of those times. Societies start with dogma and eventually proceed to anarchy striking a balance between these 2 is how you create great societies balance rules and individual freedom. Orphics found churches where anyone could be admitted and that set the stage for the conception of philosophy as a way of life.
