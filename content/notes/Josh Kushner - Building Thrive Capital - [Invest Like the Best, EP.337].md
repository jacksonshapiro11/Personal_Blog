### Highlights

- The Inner Ring: Chasing Acceptance and Finding Fulfillment
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  I promise this is my last preliminary philosophy question. But I think you tweet about once a year, so consistent with what you've said so far. The most recent precious use of one of your annual slots was to share a story from CS Lewis called Inner Ring, which I'm familiar with and love and I think it's just a fantastic little, I don't know what to call it essay story something. Why share that? What does that mean to you? What's the gist of that and why has impacted the way you think about the world?
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, so the Inner Ring is an essay written by CS Lewis. The summarized version is there are rings of people. And when you're on the outside of these rings, you'd want to be on the inside. It's this desire to feel included. It's this desire to be a part of something. And those that actually chase these rings, they do whatever they can to get inside. And once they're inside, they realize that it's not all that they thought it was meant to be. So then they start chasing for the next ring and the next ring and the next ring. And the essay concludes that effectively the goal of life should be to not try to chase anything, but rather focus on your craft, focus on the people that you love the most. And unbeknownst to you, you will appear as if you're safe and sound within a ring to the outside world, but you will have absolutely no idea. And I think for me, I have that framed in my office actually. I try to live my life every day by focusing on the things that I'm passionate about, my family, people that I love, my closest friends, and just trying to get better at the things that I do every day and try to not get distracted about the outside world.

    - **Note:** Rules are assumptions about the outside world that emerge and people follow them inertly but real creation comes by questioning rules. Big internal locus of control and team atmosphere. Inner scorecard good listener. Don’t focus on success but self improvement and interesting problems which leads to success. Inner rings by cs Lewis the idea that people perceive in groups they want to be in and chase that but when they get in it’s empty so better to pursue thick desires and see where you get from there.
- The Unconventional Fund Strategy and Growth of Thrive
  Key takeaways:
  - The idea of having a fund that could build and invest in companies at different stages was unconventional.
  - The fund's strategies have remained the same throughout different periods.
  - The team, scale of brands, and knowledge within the organizations have changed over time.
  - The significance of funds one, two, three, and four in the history of the organization.
  - A pause to discuss fund four.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Yeah. So the idea of actually having a fund that actually could build companies, invest in companies early and invest in companies late was so deeply unconventional. I feel really lucky that he saw it and he understood it. But what has enabled us to do is do the exact same thing from when we started the fund till today. Our first institutional fund was $40 million. Our last institutional fund that we raised was about $3 billion. But the strategies have been exactly the same. The only things that have changed are the team, the scale of the brands, the knowledge and insights of the people within the organizations.
  Speaker 2
  I'd love to talk a little bit about a history lesson using the funds themselves as the timeline mileposts, if you will. Tell us a little bit about the significance to you and to thrive of funds one, two, three, and four. And then I want to pause on four and talk.

- The Power of Visual Art and Vision in Founders' Success
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I think that is something that's really powerful with Terrell. I also think Terrell is also among the artists that I enjoy the most because, whether it be Terrell or Donald Judd or Solowitt, they're visual in terms of the ways in which they created the art, but they don't actually created themselves. It's more of a scientific problem or a mathematical problem that they're trying to solve and ultimately someone constructed for them. I don't know. I love music, but I don't know how to play an instrument. I love art. I've tried to learn how to paint. I'm not particularly good. I love technology, but I'm a terrible coder. So maybe my love for Terrell is more coming from the fact that someone who's visual but has others create for him just being inspiration for me.
  Speaker 2
  Reese's is an interesting question, which is artists literally are manifesting the thing in their brain and takes lack of company. Obviously, incredibly well was itself a pivot. The thing that Stewart was imagining was a game and then it became something very different. How do you think about vision as a key ingredient for founders given the number of companies that have started as one thing and become something very successfully but very different? Does vision matter?
  Speaker 1
  I think it's the most important aspect of what enables companies to realize their full potential. I think the ability to inspire and motivate is just as important as the ability to operate and hire and build. Every company is centered around a mission and that mission has to have a vision in order to determine the north star and those that dream have the capacity to motivate their people to ultimately have something that has yet to exist into world be created.
  Speaker 2
  What have you learned about the conversation and negotiation with founders for late stage investments where pencils can be out, math can be done. There's more to tether. I suspect you've gotten very good at having the conversation with the founders that you end up in a positive someplace where they're happy, you're happy, you're partners.

    - **Note:** Motivation and creating the right incentives to create a positive sum environment.
