### Highlights

- Events as trends and trends as symptoms of underlying system structure
  Relationship between structure and behavior to identify root causes and see new opportunities
  A system is a set of things interconnected such that they produce their own pattern of behavior over time. System may be influenced by outside forces but it’s response is characteristic to the system and usually complex.
    - **Tags:** #complex-adaptive-systems, #root-vs-proximate-cause, #levels-of-emergence, #self-organizing-system, #systems-thinking, #system-construction, #structure-vs-behavior
    - **Note:** Systems are self contained and create their own character over time. Events see as trends and look to the wider system structure for clues. Look at the structure to get to the root cause.
- The world is not that simple oil prices aren’t a function of supply but of demand and the systems built in oil consuming countries that rely on oil
    - **Tags:** #flows-in-systems, #complex-adaptive-systems, #supply/demand
- No one creates or want war or poverty to persist they are symptomatic of the system construction that produce these issues to make a change we must change the system. See the structure as the problem and have the courage to restructure. Negative externalities are inherent in systems.

    - **Note:** This is similar to the idea of entropy in all the energy we expend to make a system ordered. Disordered Energy leaks out and causes chaos. I don't know if you can design a system without this. It's a feature of all systems. Creation leads to chaos at a level of emergence.  
      Negative externalities as features of all systems you must choose and accept them thoughtfully.
- Archetype - common structure that produce characteristic behavior
  Systems thinking is a tool in the tool kit not meant to dominate the thinking but to provide the man with the hammer with things other than nails
  Blind people feeling an elephant shows the systems nature is often more than the sum of its parts. One feels a tusk and ear but the system is interconnected
    - **Tags:** #frameworks-(for-thinking), #understand-big-ideas-in-each-field, #cross-disciplinary, #mental-models, #the-best-of-what-others-figured-out, #archetype
    - **Note:** Systems thinking is a tool to think in archetypes bud you need to draw in concepts from other disciplines to get the full picture. Framework vs interpretations
- Systems are elements that are organized/ interconnected in some way to create a behavior/ achievement. System must be elements interconnection and function/ purpose. Adaptive dynamic and goal seeking behavior. Can you identify parts and do the parts effect each other does the combination produce a different effect greater than the sum of the whole. Is there a pattern in different circumstances. Systems contain tangible things like a schools faculty and intangible things like school pride
    - **Tags:** #systems-thinking, #complex-adaptive-systems, #lolapoloza-effect, #favorite, #goal-driven-behavior, #knowledge-(lies-in-the-connections), #systems-(definition), #emergent-behavior, #sum-greatr-than-parts, #definitions, #writing-topics
    - **Note:** Systems are interconnected elements with a function or purpose that adapt with a goal in mind containing tangible and intangible elements creating a sum greater than it's parts.
- Easier to learn about systems elements rather than interconnections. Interconnections are complex flows of information. A student decides what courses to take based on interests year in school school specialty (ie engineering) expected grade in the class and knowledge about the teacher
- Purposes are deduced from behavior. Show me what’s in your portfolio not your stated interests
  A systems goal is to perpetuate itself
  You can change all the players on a football team or all the cells in your body and get the same output/system but once you change the rules/interconnections you change the system.
  Subsystems within the system often have competing goals that obfuscate the actual system goal Because Of bad incentive alignment
  System may be adaptive goal seeking dynamic behavior more than a sum of its parts
  System vs just stuff
    - **Tags:** #systems-thinking, #purpose/meaning/goal, #show-me-whats-in-your-portfolio, #incentive-structures, #systems-(definition)
    - **Note:** A system is not it’s parts but it’s underlying rules. The patriots had a system that lead to victory even though most of the players changed constantly. Incentive alignment in systems is vital.
      Purposes deduced from behavior not words. Show me what’s in your portfolio
- Can you Identify parts do the parts effect each other is their effect as a whole different than each part acting independently and does the behavior persist in a variety of circumstances
  Storing info means increasing complexity
  Stocks are foundation of any system and they are the things you can feel count or measure over time like the books in a book store the wood in a forest or your self confidence stocks change through flows and stocks are the present memory of changing flows. If you understand stocks and flows you understand supply and demand and you understand system behavior over time. While people look at the stock the flows ie rate of change in a system is much more important. Stocks are point in time but nor progression. Stocks allow projection and gives you a buffer vs supply. Stock allows you to adjust to the flow and create a better system
    - **Tags:** #dynamic-vs-static-systems, #complex-adaptive-systems, #simplicity-(power-of), #whole->-sum-parts, #systems-thinking, #stock-and-flow, #margin-of-saftey, #complexity
    - **Note:** Complex systems are the when the whole manifests to more than the sum of its parts. The more knowledge encoded in the system the more complex it is. Stocks are important in any system and it’s vital to understand their interplay with flows which allow you to predict the system behavior in motion. Stocks are a static and flow is a continuous but there is interplay between them because the flows are more and less efficient at different stocks. Stocks change through flows.
- When a behavior persists over time there is likely a mechanism creating that behavior which is a feedback loop. Feedback loop is a reinforcing behavior that changes the flow corrective process to maintain a stock level. Ie stock of $ in bank account. Balancing feedback loop. When a hot coffee or iced coffee moves toward room temperature. Flow different stock same in the end.
    - **Tags:** #balacing-feedback-loops, #systems-thinking, #feedback-loops, #flows-in-systems, #stock-and-flow
    - **Note:** When a behavior persists over time there are likely forces reinforcing that state. These are feedback loops. We understand where the system is pushing objects like hot coffee to room temperature ect.
- Reinforcing feedback loop. The more something moves in one direction the more momentum it builds. Build factories to sell more products to build more factory ect. These feedback loops compound exponentially. Feedback system causes its own behavior
    - **Tags:** #leverage-points, #feedback-loops, #compounding, #systems-thinking
- Feedback can only change future behavior a flow can’t react to a flow instantly it can only change to a change in the stock. Models that assume immediate response to change in price are misguided so real economy and all feedback loops need time to respond. So when designing a system you must anticipate future flows to maintain a constant stock. Need to have dynamic flows and anticipate all the different flows in order to have the right mental model for the system
    - **Tags:** #leverage-points, #systems-thinking, #feedback-loops, #delays-in-systems, #complex-adaptive-systems, #dynamic-vs-static-systems, #scientism
    - **Note:** Systems have lag in their feedback loops and this is a key that restricts system change and also slows it down.
- When one loop dominates another it has an outsized effect on the system. You can have 10 different feedback loops but one could have a 99% influence so it dominates the system. Seems like domination does mean greatest effect. Those loops that dominate will determine the behavior of the system
    - **Tags:** #power-law, #focus-on-what's-important, #favorite, #leverage-points, #bottleneck
    - **Note:** Find the bottleneck or leverage point that is driving system behavior
- Dynamic system studies model out many factors and then run them to completion in different scenarios where different factors become more likely. Ultimately to asses the model you need to asses the probabilities of the components and the accuracy of the cause and effect in the model. Measure flow and interaction + likelihood. Will the model actually behave how modeled more scientific if birth rate rises and death rate stagnates will population grow. Very likely yes. Model utility isn’t about if it’s realistic because these are usually exploratory questions. Model utility isn’t if situations are realistic but if the response patterns and outcomes are realistic. Then we must ask what is driving the driving factors ie feedback loops. Many things influence outputs and system components. Systems cause own behavior and systems with similar structure have similar behavior. Growth and death loops.

    - **Note:** Models measure inputs and outputs but are you understanding the interaction well enough to model the system. More bridges and roads actually creates a worse and more systemic traffic issue because public transport atrophies faster. Models can remove complexity which when removed in big enough doses leads to the model being useless
- A smart and important part of system design is seeing the signal through the noise. Adjusting to 1 and 2 day flows in a system like a car dealership might be too fast when the real demand signals show after 5-10 days likewise in electronic trading adjusting the system in milliseconds might be too slow in the world of micro seconds. Understanding system design and response is vital when you decide to change input and outputs of a system ie when buying cars you must fully understand supply demand
    - **Tags:** #feedback-loops, #signal-vs-noise, #path-dependence, #systems-thinking, #system-construction, #favorite, #flows-in-systems, #complex-adaptive-systems, #deep-understanding-of-craft
    - **Note:** All systems are different and it's important to understand how each system functions in terms of construction and feedback loops in order to understand how to discern signal from noise. Construct the system correctly. Understand system goals and design system with right feedback loops.
      To understand system you must understand its complex interactions.
- If you over order cars then more jobs for people making cars more money in economy then people who bet on car companies in the market provide more liquidity and that keeps supply and demand high works both ways. Speculators and car dealerships and consumers and car manufacturers all with different feedback loops that contribute to the health and direction of the system. And on top of this are metals and mining limits to growth there is only a finite amount of iron ore to make cars and oil to put in cars so this is towards the carry capacity of the system and further environmental constraints provide a higher level constraint if oil goes up less people buy cars the loop turns toward doom. We must look towards all balancing loops in resource constrained systems. Nothing can grow infinitely in a finite environment

    - **Note:** Feedback loops nothing grows to the moon. Carrying capacity of systems. Supply and demand. Seen and unseen constraints on the system like the environment. There is a catalyst of supply met by an equal and opposite demand this causes gains and losses in prices. Great example of feedback loops
- In renewable resource system you can overshoot and adjust to equilibrium or overshoot beyond that equilibrium and oscillation around the equilibrium or overshoot and collapse of the system. The factors influences this is the activation energy being reached of the point of no return with the balancing feedbacks being too weak or wiped out as well
    - **Tags:** #systems-thinking, #feedback-loops, #system-destruction, #balacing-feedback-loops, #doom-loop, #activation-energy, #renewable-resources
    - **Note:** Renewable resource systems can have feedback loops that balance to a point of stasis or that break the system into a room loop.you can outrun feedback loops and destroy the system.
- Highly functional systems have one of the 3 of all
  Resilience self organization or hierarchy
  Resilience- ability to rebalance with redundancy. Meta resilience. People often confuse stability for resilience but these are not the same. Stability could hide fragility and dynamic systems can be resilient. Animal stocks remain resilient even though population numbers fluctuate. Just in time is not resilient efficiency trades of resilience. Loss of resilience means playing space shrinks and the ability to push boundaries is lower.
  Self organization the capacity of a system to make its structure more complex. Sacrifice self organization and creativity for productivity and predictably. Produces new structure disorder and needs freedom. This can be threatening to systems. Just a few set of organizing principles can create complex structure. Fractals shapes formed by simple rules. Cells divide to create a human through simple rules for complex outcomes. Human lung has enough surface area to cover a tennis court. Agricultural revolution people could stay in the same place own land and cultivate crops

    - **Note:** Systems are defined by their resilience self organization and hierarchy/ levels of emergence. Stability is not resilience and self organization is how the simple rules of complex systems can manifest into behavior. This is really how anti fragile systems are.
      Self organization trading off productivity with creativity these are at odds
- Hierarchy reduces info any part of the system contains and adds to the complexity of the system. One part of the watch does this the other does that if the minute hand stops works that glass doesn’t crack but you need all parts to create the system. When hierarchies break down they usually divide into the sub system. If you have a heart issue you may not need to solve an issue with your liver but maybe you need to change your diet which will help the whole system. Hierarchies evolve bottom up
    - **Tags:** #systems-thinking, #system-construction, #leverage-points, #hierarchy, #levels-of-emergence, #bottleneck
    - **Note:** Hierarchies are emergent properties of systems that create different behavior at different levels of emergence. They act as leverage point but they can also be big bottlenecks or points of failure, but they can also dissolve into smaller subsystems that can either be unaffected or greatly effected.
      Hierarchy allow for decentralization of sub systems functioning independently towards a common goal, but there is some interaction between those that can normally be low but at times grow very large
- Everything we think know and view on the world are models and what’s in our head are mental models. Are models are generally congruent with the world but are models fall far short of full representation the map isn’t the territory. We can only keep a few variables in our head. Take into account long term over short term. The signal through the noise. Aware of false boundaries and bounded rationality take into account confounding factors non linearity and delays. Don’t see events as surprises but view them in the longer trends of behavior. Behavior of a system is performance over time. Behavior level understanding vs event level understanding. Structure stock flows and feedback loops. System structure creates system behavior. Delays cause oscillation in systems as we try to adjust
    - **Tags:** #systems-thinking, #bounded-rationality-and-satisficing, #irreducable-complexity, #mental-models, #system-vs-point-change, #complex-adaptive-systems
    - **Note:** We create mental models of everything in our heads that simplify the complex systems we interact with daily. These maps aren’t the territory but are generally good. We need to understand how the big models play into our day and realize that a lot is irreducibly complex.
- Event event analysis gives you no insight. Behavior based is more insightful. But focused more on flows then stocks.
    - **Tags:** #systems-thinking, #system-vs-point-change
    - **Note:** Look for definitions at the systems level not event level
- Non linear systems don’t allow projections. For traffic the increasing density of cars doesn’t have a linear effect at some point the more cars mean nothing but eventually you hit a critical mass and traffic jam. First 100 cars no effect but then add 10 more at one point and traffic stops. Non linearity change the strengths of feedback loops and can flip a system from one feedback loop to another behavior instantly.
    - **Tags:** #complex-adaptive-systems, #non-linear-effects, #favorite, #feedback-loops, #exponential-vs-linear-thinking-(humans-strugle-with-exponential), #tail-risk
    - **Note:** Non linear effects in systems can result in weird behavior. Much like traffic patterns we must understand non linearity in systems at a deep level to truly understand systems. Non linear step change effects. Non linear systems are hard to predict.
- Spruce spruce worm non linearity. The worm kills the most competitive tree Ik the forest to allow diversity. Sometimes there are outbreaks when this dominant tree ie food supply is high there is an exponential increase in pests despite a linear increase in food. This is a feedback loop in action
    - **Tags:** #systems-thinking, #stock-and-flow, #feedback-loops, #red-queen-hypothesis, #spruce-worm, #diversity-(within-systems)
- Boundaries only exist within models but you must draw them they are completely arbitrary but they are key to differentiating the system. We must understand these are not real and that they are key source/ choke point of the system. The boarder between New York and New Jersey divides state lines but the land is still connected. Most arguments come over boundaries rich and poor boarder disputes ect. We must be mindful to understand boundaries but realize we cannot take into account every small boundary as we are bound to miss the forest for the trees.
    - **Note:** Boundaries exist in simplified models and effect our predictions, but the world in reality is more nuanced and fluid than the rigid boundaries allow for.
- The most import part of a system is the constraint of what is limiting the system most. Understanding what is limiting and what will become limiting is key to anticipating and growing anticipating the next limiting factor is vital to maintaining growth flywheel

    - **Note:** Systems are complex but often there are 1 or 2 areas that are much worse than the rest of the system. Instead of making something that is a 9 a 10 you get more lift turning a 4 into a 5. Find the bottleneck that is the leverage point in the system. Anticipate problems
      What is the bottleneck in your life. It’s always time but it’s never time because time is constant. Why can’t you achieve what you want.
- Delays are a key part of a system. We need to focus on which delays we need to optimize for. We must understand how delays work in order to anticipate and mitigate or even reverse effected. Climate effects only show after decades but we must try to reverse now before it’s too late
    - **Tags:** #leverage-points, #bottleneck, #delays-in-systems, #stock-and-flow, #proactive-not-reactive
    - **Note:** Delays are part of systems that we must understand
- Bounded rationality we do what we think is best but we cannot see the full picture so our decisions are imperfect and often wrong
  The bounded rationality in each actor in a system determined by the information incentive and disincentives goals stresses and constraints impinging on that actor may or may not lead to decisions that further the welfare of the system as a whole if they do not putting new actors in the same system will not improve the system performance what makes the difference is redesigning the system to improve the information incentives disincentives goals stresses and constraints that have an effect on specific actors. The bounded rationality of each actor in a system may not lead to decisions that further the welfare the system as a whole

    - **Note:** Actors in systems do not have the full picture and do what is best for them, so if the goals are such that they incentivize certain behavior. People will do what the system has as optimal for their place and to improve a system as a whole you need to create better incentive structures which come from a lack of perspective. People will do what is best for them so design the system so that whats good for them is good for the system align incentives.
      Bad system construction can foil good actors mich easier than great system construction can be corrupted by bad ones. Behavior is mostly system based.
- System structure that cause problems called archetypes. Addiction is one of these. These systems need to be changed. These are traps and opportunities. Policy resistance comes from bounded rationality when goals of sub systems are different from the goals of the system as a whole. In a policy resistant system actors drag the system where no one wants
  War on drugs government bans drugs prices go up addicts rob more people and drug lords can afford more expensive transit methods. Align goals of sub system with the goals of the system. Harmonization of goals in system.
  To raise birth rate
  Romania banned abortion birth rate tripled but then illegal abortions and mother mortality 3xed and the birth rate stagnated because the system didn’t change
  In Hungary they found that housing space was important so they provided more space for larger family which helped
  In Sweden everyone wanted to optimize for the life and health of the child and with this outcome in mind the system was updated to optimize for this. This didn’t create policy resistance but acceptance because incentives were aligned
    - **Tags:** #systems-thinking, #incentive-structures, #incentive-allignment, #tragedy-of-the-commons, #archetype, #favorite, #policy-resistance-in-systems, #root-vs-proximate-cause, #rule-beating, #unintended-consequences, #allign-skills-and-goals, #writing-topics
    - **Note:** Archetypes are issues or problem types systems create. Addiction is one.
      When you have a systems issue you need to properly align the goals of the system to the desired outcomes. When the lower level incentives don’t match the higher level ones you create the classic tragedy of the commons.
      System archetypes lead to policy resistance because of bad incentive allignment. Systems do what they're incentivized to do so create the right conditions and design for success.
- Tragedy of the commons is when there is growth /escalation in a commonly shared erodible environment. When a heardsMan wants another animals the utility is +1 but to everyone else the fraction on the commons is a small fraction so everyone does this and it erodes because of these incentives. Because the feedback loop leads to erosion then it struggles to come back the tragedy past a point can become self destructive where it once was reinforcing positively. Overexploitation of renewable resources
  3 ways to solve
  Educate and exorsion exploit/ shame people into following the rules
  Privatize the commons
  Regulate the commons mutual coercion
    - **Tags:** #tragedy-of-the-commons, #incentive-structures, #complex-adaptive-systems, #hidden-built-up-risks, #fragility-in-systems, #feedback-loops, #doom-loop
    - **Note:** Tragedy of the commons is when everyone benefits notably but the system is minutely harmed. Eventually these minute harms destroy the system, so you need to create negative incentives to prevent this.
- Drift to low performance actor perceived bad news more than good news best results are dulled abs bad results are elevated and the actual state is influenced by the perceived state. When perceived performance slips the goal slips the lower the perceived system state the lower the desired state and thus the less corrective action taken. Drift is a gradual process. Need to keep standards absolute and goals like that of the best performances in the past. If perceived performance is skewed positive with the down trends being viewed as anomalies the system will drift up not down
    - **Tags:** #perceived-vs-actual-state, #absolute-standards, #feedback-loops, #high-standards, #drift-in-performance, #doom-loop, #favorite, #motivation, #writing-topics, #performance-coaching
    - **Note:** This is a doom loop when perceived performance is slipping actual performance drops and then new lower standards are set and the system drifts negatively. Drift is gradual so corrective action must be quick and decisive and high standards must be scrupulously maintained. Standards need to be absolute to avoid drifting away
- Escalation - comes from reinforcing loop trying to one up each other. So I improve by 1% you improve by 1% this gets out of control quickly not keeping up but playing ahead. This is a runaway loop with the only way out is a bilateral agreement to stop. This can be good and bad but eventually when it runs away it gets worse

    - **Note:** When you keep one uping in an escalation cycle you need an outside event to interrupt and reset the system or else you'll enter a doom loop. To get out of this you need to transcend the system
      Escalatory spiral
- Success to the successful- flywheel when the most value accrues to the most successful people. The rich get richer and everyone else stagnates and the poor get poorer. Same pies easier for the rich to get more % over time. Ways to mitigate diversity so you get out of your niche or there is a great leveling event like anti trust or taxes/ inherentence tax
    - **Tags:** #feedback-loops, #flywheel, #compounding, #balacing-feedback-loops
    - **Note:** Positive effects compound and you need balancing loops to prevent a system from destroying itself.
- Addiction/ dependence loop - could be drugs but could also be economy addicted to excess liquidity or citizens addicted to free/ infinitely subsidized education. Shifting the burden like vaccines from natural immunity to these drugs. Some of these addictions are good but others are traps. In our care based model people take drugs rather than improve health. Fix with withdrawal and strengthening the system to cure its own ills rather than putting band aid after band aid on an ever increasing cut until the band aid isn’t big enough and you bleed out. Enhance the system through investigations rather than quick fixes which over time get much harder to rectify
    - **Tags:** #favorite, #system-construction, #long/short-term-incentive-misalignment, #system-vs-point-change, #leverage-points, #systems-thinking, #addiction/dependence-loop, #medicine-3.0, #build-nets-instead-of-using-a-line, #quick-fix, #writing-topics
    - **Note:** We become addicted to quick fixes when system level change is needed. Doing drugs to be happier instead of improving the core unhappiness in our lives then we become reliant on these drugs ect. Change the system and understand the issue don't opt for the bandaid. System vs point changes
      Fix the system don’t just solve the point.
- Rule beating - evasive action to get around the intent of a system. Abiding by the letter but not spirit of the law. This only becomes and issue when it distorts a system and perverts the goals. Like gov agencies spending money at the end of the year it doesn’t need to in order to get allocated the same or more next year. The way out of the trap is to revise to rules to work more as intended. The best way to influence the system is by realigning the purpose or goals. Seeking the wrong goal is when you overiptimze for a metric or outcome such that you game the system so that moves when that was only a proxy for the problem and the problem stays unsolved. When a metric becomes a measurement it loses its meaning. If the rules aren’t designed well then the system will produce the wrong output.

    - **Note:** Rule beating is when the rules get hacked and bastardized that violates the spirit not letter of the law. It’s very important to align incentives and goals in these scenarios because rule beating is pure incentive misalignment and tragedy of the commons.
      Systems just do what they’re built to do so when they’re built poorly it’s a rules thing. Letter not spirit of the law.
      Bad rules > bad incentives > bad outcomes
- Leverage points the place where you can make the most effect in a system with the least resources. The most highest ev place to intervene. These can often be counterintuitive. 12. The lowest leverage point is numbers. Parameters become leverage points when they trigger a higher up point in the system hierarchy but changing a number fundamentally is window dressing when trying to change a system. As long as you stay out critical parameters a large grey area of fairnesses
    - **Tags:** #leverage-points, #risk-and-return, #systems-thinking
    - **Note:** Leverage points are the best places to intervene that cause the most change vs effort.
- 11. Buffers the size of stabilizing stocks relative to their flows. Buffers too small lead to fragility but likewise big buffers lead to inflexibility to change
    - **Tags:** #flexibility, #margin-of-saftey, #leverage-points, #buffers, #bureaucracy
    - **Note:** Buffers provide a much needed margin of safety but taken to an extreme they become bloated and counter productive like bureaucracy
- 10. Stock and flow structure the physical structure and their arrangement. Physical structure is critical but it’s so hard to change that it’s not often an effective leverage point because it’s resource intensive. Need initial proper design but post design need deep understanding to optimize with the physical constraints
    - **Tags:** #initial-conditions, #system-construction, #leverage-points, #stock-and-flow, #hierarchy, #systems-thinking
    - **Note:** Stocks and flows are part of system design which are a big leverage point but hard to change once constructed so isn’t as beneficial when making changes.
- 9. Delays when you have delays you need great forecasting but even with great forecasting building a power plant with a 30 year life will be unoptimal if population grows or shrinks in 15 years. This is why central planning is tough. Delays are critical relative to stocks and flows. Too short cause over reaction too long cause intense oscillation and destruction. Delays are not often easily changeable you can’t just speed up building time 100x or the pace of discovery. Things can only change so fast before they break even with rapid pace of innovation. If you can make a change do it but generally quicker feedback increases volatility like in crypto ie instant info is bad
    - **Tags:** #feedback-loops, #systems-thinking, #system-construction, #volatility, #leverage-points, #favorite, #delays-in-systems, #complex-adaptive-systems, #learning-enviornments-(quick+good-feedback), #feedback-too-fast-can-be-bad, #signal-vs-noise
    - **Note:** Delays cause a worse feedback association which creates a more wicked learning environment which harms the system. They are often tough to change.
      Sometimes rapid feedback loops can lead to more volatility because people react instead of digesting. Feedback loops can we too fast and too slow. Delays have effects but can be very tough to change.
- 8. Balancing feedback loop When we strip away response time we introduce fragility which leads to destruction ie sleeping less or destroying habitat leads to a big bill that needs to be paid eventually. The strength of the balancing loop is vital to fixing complex system. Self correcting feedback loops are important. Balancing feedback loops just be as strong as the effect we seek to correct. Bigger the issue bigger the feedback loop needed
    - **Tags:** #balacing-feedback-loops, #compounding, #self-organizing-system, #complex-adaptive-systems, #fragility-in-systems, #systems-thinking
    - **Note:** Balancing feedback loops help prevent a system from runaway issues.
- 7. Reinforcing feedback loop - exponential growing loop leads to explosion growth or complete erosion eventually leads to runaway effects and destruction. Usually balancing loop kicks in. Reducing the gain in a reinforcing feedback loop is usually more powerful then strengthening balancing loops. Slowing growth rates.

    - **Note:** A reinforcing feedback loop helps stabilize the system you can limit the growth of the loop exponentials compound quickly or have a strong balancing loop. Lowering the rate of compounding is more beneficial. Doing less bad leads to more success than trying to counter with good remove don’t add.
- 6. Information flows structure who does and doesn’t have access to information. Missing information/ providing new information leads to more awareness to both stocks and flows. Those who had power meters in visible areas used less power. Adding or restoring information flows creates new loops. Set information flows such that it’s accretive not destructive to system structure. Compelling feedback like saying which govt programs your taxes went to or putting yourself on the front line of a war if you felt it was just. People avoid accountability that’s why this leverage point is so effective

    - **Note:** Having strong feedback loops and good information flow is key to creating a good system. Improving these are a key leverage point. It aligns incentives increasing accountability and transparency
- 5. Rules - incentives punishments constraints. When we restructure rules we change the system. How would learning be different if the class got graded as a collective vs individual. Rules are why lobbying exists. Pay attention to rules and who has power over those rules. When these are the same and stake holders are different it’s clear there is incentive im misalignment

    - **Note:** Changing rules and incentive structures of a system will have a key effect in what actors do in that system. Rules shape system incentives
- 4. Self organization the power to add change or evolve system structure. Change themselves utterly by creating whole new structures and behavior. Like evolution or tech no logical advance. This means or describes the ease at which a system is able to change any of its lower level parts like it’s rules or balancing loops. Brain takes in inputs creates new thought. Good rules and simple rules can create very complex systems with good self organizational structure think genetic code is only 4 letters. Self organization is a matter of source or evolutionary raw material with highly variable source/stock of information from which to select patterns and a means for experimentation for selecting and testing new patterns. This is why diversity in systems is vital. A system that scorns experimentation or insistence on one way cuts back resilience a system that wipes out the raw material of innovation is doomed. The intervention point is give up control and let 1000 flowers bloom. You need to let go so the system can work

    - **Note:** Good rules and simple rules can create very complex systems with good self organizational structure think genetic code is only 4 letters, but has a good framework for combining and organizing which is where the power is. Diversity in system is vital. Go long emergent behavior and complexity with good simple rules of self organization. The entire universe is made up of 100 elements self organization in systems is vital.
- 3. Goals the purpose or function of the system. All things lower on the list will conform to the goals of the system. The goal of balance has to trump the goal of runaway system loops. Only very powerful people in the system can change the goals
    - **Tags:** #goal-driven-behavior, #systems-thinking, #leverage-points, #incentive-structures
    - **Note:** The goal of the system is a key leverage point very hard to change but everything aligns with the goals.
- 2. Paradigms the mindset out of which the system rules delays loops structure arises. Shared idea in minds of society the great big unstated assumptions that constitute the societies paradigm or deepest set of beliefs of how the world should function these beliefs are unstated because it is unnecessary to state them everyone knows them. Paradigm are the sources of systems that produce lower level behaviors. Our current paradigms define our system structure and differentiate it from the past. Everyone surrounds themselves with a core belief of what they think. Egyptians built Pyramids because they believed in an after life we build skyscrapers because we believe we can own land and city space is valuable. Hardest to change but this can also happen instantly Einstein and quantum mechanics. To change paradigm you prove the old paradigm is wrong and show why the new one is right. Change paradigms only once we can model the system and step outside of it

    - **Note:** One way we can change a system is by changing the paradigms it's built on this is a core level change and requires a deep understanding of the system existing paradigms and new proposed paradigms. Paradigms are a shared idea in the minds of society and you need to reshape that idea with a completely new idea of what that thing represents.
      Deepest set of beliefs on how the world should function. Bias inherent in all models. To change a paradigm, we must transcend it.
- 1. Transcending paradigms. Keep one’s self unattached to the arenas of paradigms to be flexible and realize no one paradigm is wholly correct and use each and the mental models to create a more accurate view of reality. They’re all limited understanding simplified models. Map is not the territory. Let go into not knowing to become enlightened. People who cling to paradigms. Take one look that everything we believe is nonsense and run from it. There is no power in realizing every world view is uncertain if no one is right then you can use each view more effectively. In this space of mastery over paradigm is where there is true leverage. There is nothing to be valued in rejecting all paradigms but actually rejecting paradigms gives you radical empowerment and choice over what you believe in order to serve your purpose or find a purpose. The higher the leverage point the more it is resisted that’s why society rejects the most enlighten. There are no cheap tricks to mastery you must let go and dance with the system.

    - **Note:** True leverage is such a deep understanding of the system you can transcend it because you know it so deeply. You stand above the system and don't have to exist within the bounds of society; everything is a simplified model and you must rise above. Don’t reject paradigms but play with them for your benefit.
- People think there is a key to systems and control but this isn’t true. Systems thinking is just a map for systems
  How to live in a world of systems.
  Get the beat if the system and observe how it works learn the history. Starting with the behavior helps frame the conversation and starts with background and facts not theories. Starting with behavior gives you a dynamic view. Helps us define the system by its behavior not the preferred solution
    - **Tags:** #systems-thinking
    - **Note:** Systems thinking is a map. Define a system by it's behavior then work toward your solution for the system. Systems thinking is just a guide or map
- Expose your mental models to the light of day. The more you express your thinking clearly the quicker you can see errors and adjust. This makes you more mentally flexible. The ability to redraw boundaries when you’re wrong is vital in a world of flexible systems. Everything is a model and collect as many as possible and then prove and disprove them. Practice the scientific method

- Honor distribute and respect information. Information is power

- Make the cleanest simplest use of language but no simpler. We see only what we can talk about if we can’t find a word or words are ability to understand a concept is lower. Language is the most primal word. A society needs to use the right words. The increase of meaningless language is leading to the denigration of people and communities. People who use words like efficiency without resilience leads to fragility

    - **Note:** Language is meant to be simple and prescriptive and our lexicon bounds our knowledge we can’t understand what we can’t conceptualize. Degradation of language and second order effects.
- Pay attention to what is important not just what is quantifiable. If you can’t measure doesn’t mean it’s not vital. There is no number to measure prejudice but it does effect results greatly
  Make feedback policies for feedback systems.
  Optimize for the good of the whole. The growth and wellbeing of the system. The system needs good footing in order to stand and be robust

    - **Note:** Just because you cannot put a number to something does not mean there is no value. These can be extremely important. Optimize for the system being robust and strong as a whole and create strong feedback loops. We need to value the intangibles more
- Locate responsibility in the system look how the system creates its own behavior especially with regard to outside events. Sometimes outside events are more important but other times increasing responsibility to the correct stake holders. Increase ownership

    - **Note:** Embrace failure stay humble keep learning.
- Celebrate complexity
  Expand time horizons when you look forward you see the longer term effects played out. We experience issues created from yesterday and 100 years ago. See short and long term
  Defy the disciplines don’t get siloed. Systems lead across traditional boundaries. To understand the system you need to learn from chemists and theologians understanding their jargon but not being limited by their biases. Interdisciplinary thinking works when they admit ignorance to each other.
  Expand the boundaries of caring implications of moral and practical rules are often the same in the wide view

    - **Note:** To truly understand a system we must step back consider all stakeholder and be open minded to everyone. We need to think interdisciplinary admit ignorance and crave learning and being right over the long term
