  But this is a great tweet on how to ship fast as a small company looking for product market fit. Product market fit is the is the holy Product market fit is everything as a tech startup, as a startup at all in general, and all efforts should be oriented toward achieving product market Fit as fast as possible. As an anecdote or even as just a simple sort of data point, is like I have never once seen a company achieve product market fit that has failed and I can't think of one. So if you can think of one share with me because that would be a very interesting case study. So that's why it's like it's really like if you want to reduce all existential risks that's the most important thing. So how do you do that as a small company with limited resources? Five tips avoid side quests, focus on coding, focus on selling and talking to users. That's it. No process. Don't add sprint planning and off -sites and recurring one -on -ones. Just gather, talk about what needs to ship and ship it. Hire people who love to ship fast just like you. And if they can't do this, most people cannot do this, so don't bother working with them. Don't hire people who can't ship fast. It's tempting to be like we need an EA or we need a business development person or we need a social media manager. All this really does for the founding team. Typically, I agree this is true, is it creates more work for you. You have very limited time. You got to focus on shipping product, talking to users, and selling. And then have a simple and fast tech stack. So a new hire should be able to write a feature in a day and deploy to users in 30 minutes. That means you're deploying multiple times a day. And that's something really awesome to strive for. By the way, this is for the crypto people. ([Time 0:36:16](https://share.snipd.com/snip/33850bfa-47a2-48de-befd-b50861524b1e))

- Exploring the Conscious and Subconscious Aspects of the Self
  Summary:
  The balance between the conscious and subconscious aspects of oneself is a crucial question, with a spectrum ranging from deep self-awareness to being consumed by the unknown subconscious.
  The journey involves making the unconscious conscious, shaping all behaviors and interactions. Identity is malleable and controllable, allowing for external changes, although core truths may remain unaltered internally over time.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 4
  That was very helpful. I love that and I agree. So back to Nick's question is like how much of that within us four do you think is subconscious versus conscious? Because I feel like we're pretty conscious guys. That's what it tells. I feel like we're pretty like self -aware guys so like we're attempting to be right we've like we've moved a lot of our subconscious into consciousness I would assume larger than the
  Speaker 1
  Mean it was what I presume so is it like an iceberg situation where 10% of it is known and like 90% of his unknown yeah I mean like if you put I't know, you put Jesus at the top of the most like Conscious person who conquered all of his, you know, human subconscious, you know, traumas and traits, and then you have a spectrum that exists all the way down to the person that's Existing in hell, and is just completely just destroyed and living in hell and everything that and they're on the brink of suicide. Like that's the spectrum. And so where are we at? And a lifelong journey of making the unconscious conscious. I think that no one will ever make everything conscious. But I think the question is really, really interesting and really, really powerful. Like, back to your original like, you know, question, Nick, I think it's a really interesting and important question because that identity ultimately makes up like all of your behaviors, All of your actions, how you interact with people and your friends, how you interact with your wife or your boyfriend or your girlfriend. Like everything is encompassed by that like set of beliefs of who you are. And you asked the question early on, how fixed is it? I think it's super malleable. It's so much more malleable than so many other things in life. It's one of the only things we control. Yeah. I could wake up tomorrow and decide I'm a different person. I could. Can you? I don't. But I could. Ooh, I don't know if you can. Can you? I don't know if you can. I think it's a practice.
  Speaker 2
  It's not necessarily something you just do and absolutely change. It's a practice that you try to work on and over time.
  Speaker 1
  Can you? I don't know. I think you can change who you are externally facing very rapidly. I think that there might certain truths that you hold inside like that you are near and dear to your heart and your identity but you don't necessarily show as part of your identity. But I think your identity in from an external sort of like perspective can change rapidly. ([Time 1:46:48](https://share.snipd.com/snip/78362ba7-00a2-4872-9338-98f610fbb688))

- Affirmation and Identity
  Summary:
  The speaker discusses the practice of affirmations to shape their identity.
  The affirmations were a mix of current self and aspirational self, leading to becoming what was affirmed. They believe in the power of affirmations as a rational concept based on energy and physics laws.
  Affirmations are seen as a way to brute force one's identity by repeatedly putting it out into the world.
  The speaker suggests that affirmations initially done in private can later be verbalized for leverage.
  They emphasize the subconscious's role in recognizing authenticity in affirmations, leading to genuine change in behavior and identity. The speaker gives examples of how affirmations can impact confidence and behavior, creating a feedback loop with the external world.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  But like, can you - I used to wake up every day and my alarm was a recording of myself telling myself who I am. Ooh, I like that. Wow. Years of that.
  Speaker 3
  That's the most, that is the most Armand thing you've ever said in the history of Armand. I get it. I memorize my affirmation. I love it so much.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, a series of affirmations of who I am and what I am doing and what I am creating in the world.
  Speaker 4
  Can I ask you about that? Was it who you currently are or who you, or who your vision of yourself is? I love that.
  Speaker 1
  I's kind of your aspects of it now you better be to be that in the future. But so much of it was aspirational. And guess what? I became that. It's funny because it's so many ways. It doesn't come on the deadline. Think you can achieve in one year is always wrong. You always overestimate what you can achieve in a year and you always almost certainly underestimate what you can achieve in a decade.
  Speaker 2
  But it sounds like maybe you two haven't gone down this path, but do you? I don't do this weird stuff. Well, no, I don't. What do you think about it? Could you brute force your identity? Like you just said over and over again.
  Speaker 3
  Yeah. Like I think there's like an act. There's like an intersection between me and some of the WUWU people in this regard, like the affirmations people, the secret people.
  Speaker 2
  I've never been in the WUWU camp because I think to you we're WUWU, but we have other people who are more WUWU.
  Speaker 3
  I think there's a non -WUWU explanation for this. I think the whole universe is built on laws of physics and energy. One of the main laws of physics is you know for every action there's sort of like an equal and opposite reaction like when you when you push on something you get a pushback like so I do think Like if you put stuff out there either mentally or energetically or physically or whatever like you you do get some sort of like that's what he's describing yeah like I think it's totally Rational that's what he's describing. And I don't think it's really that cool at all. I agree. Yeah. I think you totally can brute force your identity.
  Speaker 1
  It goes right back to like you put it out, you think it, you talk about it, you do it, you put it out.
  Speaker 4
  People comment on your abs and your leaning and your 4 .7. You have to follow up. You can't just write it down and then it happens. You have to follow up.
  Speaker 2
  That's why I think it's better to do the affirmations in private rather than verbally do it, at least until you have some kind of momentum. Like, you already have to.
  Speaker 3
  If you're in private, though, I think there is something to actually just really putting it out there in the world, literally, verbally to getting leverage on yourself is what you're Talking about yeah and I think like when you tell I think people in the world too are largely looking to react to things and to be guided and so like if you go out in the world and be like I am This person like you will just be that person and then like most people are like, okay. I agree. Yeah, you're that person. No, I see like, I think your subconscious is smarter than that, right?
  Speaker 2
  So let's say you are someone who's never ran before and you're like, I am a marathon runner. I am going to run a marathon. And people be like, oh, that's nice. Like, that's great, good job. Your subconscious realizes that they just repeated back to you, They just mirrored to you. They're like, eh. You know, like I kind of pick up that you're not there yet. You know, like, and it's not it's not good.
  Speaker 3
  But like, like another example of this is like confidence, right? Like, if you truly go out into the world and like, I am a confident person. Like, if you and if you actually kind of sell that, even if you aren't confident, you get a reaction from people that will be this like feedback loop because they will sort of treat you As confident and they will. And you will become more confident based on that. And then you create this like push and pull thing. ([Time 2:02:37](https://share.snipd.com/snip/72fd95e9-eaba-4a22-ad1e-f4a25b3fef4f))

    - **Note:** You overestimate the immediate changes in identity but underestimate the long-term implications. Choosing to live up to who you want to be. Repeat to yourself who you are and who you want to be and you’ll become that. Put it out and follow up. Manifest who you want to be. Create yourself
