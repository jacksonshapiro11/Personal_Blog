  Speaker 1
  And then I took that 80 million and I gave it to Li Lu and he turned it into 400 or $500 million. So Li Lu is known to have this cult-like following. He's known to have fantastic financial returns, but that is not what this book is about. Li wrote this book in his early twenties when he fled communist China for the United States. When the book ends, there is no possible way for Lee to know or predict what his future holds. And so I want you to keep that in mind as we go through what is going to be one of the most remarkably difficult childhoods that you and I have ever studied together. And so the book starts with Lee Lu when he's in preschool, and I need to tell you up front, this book is really hard to find. There's only two copies available on Amazon right now. One is for sale for like $300, the other for $600. So I need to think Kenny Lee and my friend Moses Kagan. Kenny lent this book to my friend Moses and then he allowed Moses to send the book to me, which in turn allows me to make this podcast for you. So let's go ahead and jump into this unbelievable story. The last three year old besides myself was crying in the big room of the kindergarten, a boarding school for preschoolers. But soon even he would go and I would be left all alone. And then the hunger. I dreamt of eating lizard meat. The only thing I could do was drink water to fill my stomach so full that it hurt and made me briefly forget about my hunger. And so at this boarding school, this kindergarten, Lee is the only one without a family. ([Time 0:02:40](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f3582ee9-246e-407d-a57a-6596261bea04))
    - **Note:** Li grew up at a boarding school in communist China without a family and he would dream of eating lizard because he was so hungry. He’d drink water just to fill his stomach. The children in kindergarten would call li a bastard without parents. The teacher would pit children against each other to manipulate and control them. Teacher beat the children constantly. Li realized he didn’t need to listen to others and grew in confidence. He realized it was indoctrination and did what people never did in China thought for themselves. This made him a truth seeker and fighter he questioned his reality and was rewarded. There were kids called officials in elementary school who were given power from the teachers and used it to bully and intimidate other people. Li when he was intimidated punched the kid in the face stood up to him and gained very high status was never bullied again.
- Knowledge Unlocks Potential
  Summary:
  A child's intellectual development, particularly the ability to read, can dramatically alter their life circumstances and self-worth.
  Despite achieving a significant status boost, the child's profound sense of inferiority stems from isolation and lack of external knowledge. This lack of contact with the outside world stunts personal growth, leading to feelings of inadequacy when compared to peers who engage in broader social interactions.
  However, innate instincts and skills, invaluable for future success as an investor, begin to formulate even within constrained environments.

  Speaker 1
  Which completely crushed his position as the number one leader. The second and third officials looked at each other and then ran away. This greatly enhanced the status that Lee had with his other kids in our small society. It rose from the very bottom right to the top. Yet, I retained a deep sense of inferiority from my lack of contact with the outside world. Wait till he learns how to read. That changes his entire life because at this point he's completely, he has no family, no money, no resources of any time, of any kind, doesn't leave. He's the only child not to leave the walls of the kindergarten. Everything he does, everything he learns is completely controlled by others. He has no idea what's going on with the outside world. And you see right from the very beginning, he develops these instincts and these skills that become very valuable if you want to be an investor, right? When other children were talking about what they saw and heard on Saturday night and Sunday, I felt inferior. I had no way of acquiring information. ([Time 0:07:00](https://share.snipd.com/snip/106c9236-1c8c-4eb8-b599-1b6c8f47ecfd))
    - **Note:** He never left the kindergarten and had no concept of the outside world. He was always curious asking questions. His parents were intellectuals and this was the lowest class in China. They couldn’t have kids and own a house. His mom owned land which made her an enemy of the state and her dad was overheard listening to foreign radio and accused of being a spy. He never knew his dad. When you give people power they abuse it is the meaning of the book and many stories. He is taken in by his dads friend who is a poor coal miner with 6 kids already. At 6 li needs to work to survive getting food and supplies off the streets to help feed the family. The zhangs were the people in charge and gave out the food and would regularly starve people.
- Evil and Loss: The Weight of Family
  Summary:
  The Zangs symbolize the corrupt and cruel power dynamics in the community, leveraging their government connections to control resources like ration tickets, which they manipulate to harm others.
  The devastating impact of a mine explosion leads to the collapse of a family, stripping them of their primary breadwinner and plunging them into poverty and despair. The emotional toll of losing a family pillar forces the mother and her six children into survival mode, resulting in a rapid decline into hunger and helplessness.
  This trauma is compounded by the protagonist's feelings of estrangement from his parents, illustrating a fractured family dynamic where living with multiple families leaves him feeling like an outsider.
  These experiences underscore the harsh realities of their environment, marked by loss, instability, and the struggle to find belonging amidst adversity.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And so there is a family in the community called the Zangs. And he says, when I think of the Zangs, I think of true evil. So these are people living in the neighborhoods, but they have close relationships with the government. And they call them the director of the neighborhood committee. And so the government sends the directors of the neighborhood committee ration tickets. Ration tickets were required to buy such things as meat, fish, and vegetables. But if the Zengs did not like you, they could simply tell you that they didn't get enough tickets from the district government and it's such a star view. They also had close connections with the local police, which gave them further power. And this is his description of Aunt Zhang. She was cold and cruel and always found a way to hurt people. And so the neighborhood he's growing up in is inhabited. It's really close to the coal mines. It's inhabited by coal mine workers. That's what Big Dad does. He says one day there had been an explosion in the mine. Dozens of miners were trapped. Big Ma looked stunned. Her husband was among the dozens of miners stuck down there. So Big Ma and Leeloo go to the mines and this is what happens. We saw about 10 miners emerge pushing carts. On the carts were bodies. We found Big Dad on a cart. His face was blue, his mouth, nose, and ears full of coal. He was cold and hard. Big Ma collapsed. This family had lost its pillar. And so did Li Lu. Remember his dad, who he thinks is his dad, said, Don't worry, I will protect you. I am here for you. The family had lost its pillar. What would they do now? A family of six children and a mother. The family collapsed. We had nothing left. Very soon the family had nothing to eat. I could no longer stay with them." Think about that. That's an entire story in four sentences. Everything I'm reading to you happens over many, many pages. But those four sentences tell you an entire story. The family collapsed. We had nothing left. Very soon, the family had nothing to eat. I could no longer stay with them. Remember Big Ma and her six sons. We'll go back to them in about three years from now. Now he's about seven or eight years old when this is happening. His parents are being, quote unquote, rehabilitated by the Chinese government. And so for the very first time, he's going to live with his parents. They live together in a single small room, no bigger than a room in a student dormitory, is the way that Lilloo describes this. My family finally had space of its own. Every few weeks, my mother would come in from the commune, where she's living and working, and I guess being rehabilitated, and we would get together. I called the days when we were together the days I have a home, but I felt awkward with my parents. They were strangers to me." And so Leda is the math for us. He says by the time he's almost nine, I had lived with at least nine families. ([Time 0:11:57](https://share.snipd.com/snip/22eca7e7-b622-417b-93da-ff69b533ffd3))
    - **Note:** How a family can fall apart instantly and the worst parts of humanity. His parents are being rehabilitated he lived with 9 families by the time he was 9. He wanted to learn and have agency his parents were strangers.
- The Power of Generosity and Learning
  Summary:
  An intense desire to learn emerges from a challenging upbringing marked by instability and feelings of inferiority.
  This longing is fueled by the aspiration to support loved ones financially. Despite facing neglect and the looming absence of family, a teacher’s generosity provides a lifeline.
  The teacher’s willingness to offer shelter and encourage education highlights the critical impact that compassionate mentorship can have on a young person's future.
  This pivotal moment ignites a love for reading and sets the stage for future success.
  However, the recurring theme of authority figures abusing their power underscores the complex realities of the environment surrounding this journey of self-improvement and resilience.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And this is the beginning of this intense desire to learn, to learn how to read and to make money so he can support himself and the people he loves. I felt superfluous, being shunted from house to house and gradually inferior. Perhaps the world did not welcome me. I wanted to grow up fast so I could make money and support Big Ma. One day my father's institute told him that he would be sent away for six months. My mother was still living in the Orchard commune and none of my parents' friends could take me in any longer. And he is saved by the generosity. He's got a of a teacher. He's got a bunch of atrocious teachers, but he's got a few that have great hearts and that actually care about him and want to teach him and help him. One day at my school, teacher Wang said to me, I hear you're leaving us. Do you still want to learn to read and write? I told her I want to study. She said, you cannot leave here. You can live in my home if your family cannot take care of you. And this is going to be one of the most important sentences of the book because it's going to be the foundation upon which his future wildly, wildly successful career is going to rest Upon. I had begun to love reading. And yet in every new environment, he finds the same reoccurring theme that those in authority, that those in power routinely abuse the people that they have power, control and dominion Over. And so there's this kid in the neighborhood called Fatty. ([Time 0:14:39](https://share.snipd.com/snip/730077a6-c00b-4e1d-a65f-71028fdc039f))
    - **Note:** He always sees people abusing power. He has a teacher take him in and teach him to read when he has no one and nowhere to go. He survived the deadliest earthquake ever. Can’t catch a break. Grew up very fast and wanted to provide for himself. Learned how to read and loved learning. When he’s 10 he sees the family that took him in the dad big pa had died earlier the other 7 just died in the quake. He passed out. This dude had so much loss. The people preach equality but those in power just abuse it. Hypocrisy is constant by the exact people who preach equality.
- Education: The Path to Paradise

  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  The national college entrance exams have resumed. I asked what is a college entrance exam? He said any young person who wants to enter college has to pass an exam. It's kind of a competition. What is a competition? I asked. Competition means you work hard and society will give you a reward. I still didn't quite understand it. Is competition a good thing? Of course it is, he said. Little Lou, you should work hard to prepare for your future. Go to college and study hard, he said. Now I remember this talk and the last sentence repeated itself constantly. I now knew what I wanted to do. I want to go to college. I had found my road to paradise. I kept saying to myself, I want to go to college. I want to study. This book is going to end with the Tiananmen Square Massacre and Li literally being on the run from the Chinese government. He's put on the list, I think, of like the top 21 most wanted student leaders for the Tiananmen Square demonstrations and protests and everything they did. Some of them did not escape to other places like Li was able to. And as a result, they spent nine years in prison, 13 years in prison in China. And so when Li tells you in the book right now, I found my road to paradise, I kept saying to myself, I want to go to college, I want to study. He moves to the United States, he can't speak English. He learns English in a summer. ([Time 0:24:42](https://share.snipd.com/snip/267cf669-f043-4b5b-9c4f-6c85434fcfb2))
    - **Note:** Li learned his parents were revolutionaries he went to college when mao died he was one of the the most wanted people in China had to escape to America got 3 degrees at once. At Columbia. He does such deep research because it saved his life. When he looks at a company he talks to that persons butcher. He gets literally everything hates lazy unprepared people. He came to America to save his life knowing no English this dude is a tank Jesus. He discovers a library and sees books are his way out. His grandma was a teacher and was sentenced to 20 years. Li finds all his friends are in books. Books change his life. Students were slaves and he had a free thinking club in private. He was a non conformist rebel and had to leave China to save his life. He must go to the us. He worked so hard it’s insane. He became politically active and was there at tienamin square this forced him to flee from China. He was most wanted in China he uses a smuggling route to escape China.

  Speaker 1
  The second half is about becoming much more politically active. And then it ends with the Tiananmen Square Massacre and Lee having to flee for his life. So I'm going to pick it up right there. Television, radio and ubiquitous loudspeakers all kept repeating. Citizens of Beijing, stay in your homes tonight. Students return to your colleges. The army is going to clear out Tiananmen Square tonight. Citizens of Beijing, stay in your homes tonight. I saw the army start to march towards the square. People tried to stop them with their bodies. Soldiers pushed their way forward, bayonets raised. A girl student from Beijing University went up to the soldiers and said, the students aren't rioters but patriots. A soldier thrust his bayonet into her chest and she fell down dead. People ran over to her. The tanks kept coming and coming and opened fire. Everywhere people were dropping. People could not believe that the government could have shot at its own people. The tanks never stopped and they ran over the bodies. The soldiers were mad. They killed whoever was in their way. Hundreds of armed soldiers charged the crowd. Gunshots created chaos. The north side of the square was a sea of fire. Dozens of tanks entered the square. All the tents were being smashed under them. There were still hundreds of people in them. They had gone to sleep, thinking the worst would be that the police would haul them on to a bus and send them back to college. Now they were being ground to pieces. People shouted names, parents trying to find their sons and daughters. My mind became stone. Only one thought was chiseled on it. Why am I still alive? And so now everybody's fleeing and trying to run from Tienan Square. And Li says over the next few days, I stayed at a different place each night. The government put my name on the list of wanted people. Our descriptions were issued to customs, railway stations, bus stations, neighborhood committees. Our photos were posted all over the country and shown on television. And so this time, Hong Kong is still British colonies. So Lee actually uses a smuggling route that was established to bring contraband of Western goods from Hong Kong. And so he uses that route to escape China. And he describes the last day in China, Don was approaching, I came out of the basement, it took a deep breath, I would not go to prison, I would escape. I looked back on my life so far, I had grown from an unwanted child to a fighter in Tina Minh Square and now I was a criminal wanted by the government. I had experienced oppression and rebelled against it. I didn't want to give in. I wanted to escape. I didn't know what kind of life awaited me. I just knew that I was on my way. That is how the book ends. This is when he starts a new life in New York at 23 years old. 23 year old Leeloo had no idea, couldn't possibly have known what lay ahead in his future. ([Time 0:32:38](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8d6cd13d-da25-432d-826e-ad7ed64d4103))
    - **Note:** Tienamin square description. He leaves China and comes to America.
