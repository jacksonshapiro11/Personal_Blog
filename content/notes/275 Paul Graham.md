  Shit because it's extremely exciting when some of the most formidable people in in history that did not know each other that did not weren't even alive at the same time worked in different industries in different parts of the um lived in different parts of the world and yet they came to the same conclusion through you know trial and error and building their not in building their company and and doing their work and so it's again paul has like this almost like a if you ever played video games like um i don't know if they said this but when i was a kid there's like this god level view right where you could see everything going on in the game i think paul has a lot of that because he's just sees thousands of them very few people are going to be exposed to the same Stuff he is right so he's like there's very very very clear patterns and responses as remarkable so how often several people have been surprised by exactly the same thing number one be careful with co-founders this was the surprise mentioned by the most founders think about that that is crazy what people wish they paid more attention to when choosing co-founders was character and commitment not ability i think paul says it here but if not uh the best way i heard to describe it's like you pick your co-founder like you pick somebody you're going to marry to it's not like a light decision right well people wish they paid more attention to when choosing co-founders was character and commitment not ability this was particularly true when the startups with the service of field the lesson don't pick co-founders who will flake here is a typical response so Um you have paul writing i'll tell you when it's paul speaking and then in the essay he has quotes from these emails that he got back from the founders so this is an example this says he doesn't tell you who the founder is but he tells you what they said you haven't seen someone's true colors unless you work with them on a startup so then paul says we've learned this lesson a long time ago if you look at the yc application there are more questions about the commitment and relationships of their founders then their ability paul continues founders of successful startups talked about how hard they work to maintain their relationship this is an excerpt from an email that paul includes about a founder answering this question and this founder says one thing that surprised me is how the relationship of startup founders goes from A friendship to a marriage my relationship with my co-founder went from just being friends to seeing each other all the time fretting over the finances and cleaning up shit and the startup was our baby i summed it up once like this it's like we're married but we're not fucking back to paul several people use the word married it is far more intense relationship than you usually see between co-workers so this relationship has to be built of top quality materials and carefully maintained it is the basis of everything so when i got to this section it made me think of this text conversation so i became friends through the podcast with this founder he's actually a two-time founder yc founder's name's john kugen he's awesome my favorite uh educational youtuber he makes excellent videos on link below with one that price center doesn't people it's called The entire history of silicon valley but anyways john text me because he was working on a video he's got this idea and he was asking about like is there historical precedence of two successful founders working together on a new project after an acquisition and based on his research he seems he said it seems like it always failed and i went through every single episode like the episode title is just trying to see if i come up with anything so i'm just going to read you this long text like thought that i that i sent him and it's not specific to you know founders one founder buying another company's another founders company and then working together it's kind of clear uh theme in the history of entrepreneurship and it says my get my initial guess is no because it tends to evolve into one clear main Founder and even if the co-founder or the partner stays it's usually and it's clearly in a subordinate role i immediately think of angi karnigee and henry kate fic both two super successful founders andrew buys henry's company the episode 73 is on this what happened i ([TimeÂ 0:45:26](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5d30b844-3943-415a-853e-3825bc5224c1))
