### Highlights

- Founders would rather make 100k on their own than 10mm working for someone it is a mentality not a job title. Working for yourself
  Focus internally and control what you can control anything outside of your power is useless to consider you need to push through it depression setbacks will always happen you just need to keep going. – Internal locus of control and maintain the right mindset
  Commit to being the best and run like hell towards it.
  Weigh opportunity cost don’t try a turn around business but put the throttle down on a successful one to be a world beater. – opportunity cost
  Only a fool tests the depth of the water with 2 feet always need w a back up plan and ideally creates it ans nurture it when you don’t need it so it’s there when you do need it. – maintain your optionality
  The greatest thing you could do to help your competition is hiring poorly – Hire A players

    - **Note:** Founders have a deep desire to work for themselves even if it’s not a point of max leverage.
      Hire a players and maintain your optionality while doubling down on what’s working not trying to revive something that isn’t attention and capital is finite.
      You will have failure and set backs but you need to keep pushing forward and running like he’ll through the issue.
