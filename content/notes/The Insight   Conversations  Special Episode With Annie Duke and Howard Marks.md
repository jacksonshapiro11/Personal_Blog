### Highlights

- Episode AI notes
  1. In order to make better decisions, it is important to separate outcome from decision quality and focus on what is not known, objectively analyzing facts from different perspectives and considering others' knowledge.
  2. Treating decisions as bets can help assess probabilities, uncertainties, and the possibility of others having different information or perspectives, thus improving decision quality.
  3. Short-term outcomes should be ignored as they are unreliable due to luck. Decision quality should not be solely based on short-term outcomes.
  4. Embracing uncertainty in forecasts is important, and it is better to make precise point forecasts with specific percentages instead of using vague terms like 'likely'.
  5. Great forecasters speak with confidence but acknowledge the possibility of being wrong. They update their forecasts as they gather more information, maximizing accuracy and understanding of uncertainty.

- Separate single outcomes from decision quality. Mind the same size of a decision set. Think about learning environments everyone is a genius in a bull market. We don’t like to think our successful decisions are luck based. Scientific method. Understand base rates when splitting luck and skill and understand the drivers making $100 through arbitrage and a radon stock gave different causal factors so that helps you understand luck and skill. Look through alternate histories and somethings are unknown unknowns. Know what you know and not know. Have a forecast and probability that you’re right. Too much confidence leads to issue not measured uncertainty. We want to think we’re smart and don’t look for the factors that can lead to our success and failure. We hate hearing we’re wrong.

    - **Note:** process vs outcome keeping in mind law of small numbers/ sample size and learning environment be scientific. Understand base rates and process to split luck from skill. if you design a perpetual motion machine that'll work better than making the same on Doge more objective truth.
      Thinking probabilistically and about your known unknowns and unknown unknowns. We need to look objectively to why we were successful dont think youre smart we overrate luck and underrate skills but be objective. Make clear predictions this is popperian epistemology
- Embracing Uncertainty: The Power of Point Forecasts
  Key takeaways:
  - People prefer language that has a broad target area when making forecasts.
  - Making precise point forecasts can help embrace uncertainty.
  - Using terms like 'likely' is a way to avoid being wrong and communicate uncertainty.
  - Great forecasters use specific probabilities to express their beliefs.
  - Forecasters update their forecasts as more information becomes available.

  Speaker 1
  One of the interesting things about forecast and that that brings up is that people like language that has a broad target area. Let's put it that way. So we love to say that things are likely or probable or will happen more often than not. Because it just allows us to completely get out of that problem. But by transitory, I meant something totally different than what you said. I think it's interesting because one of the ways to embrace uncertainty that might be a little bit counterintuitive is to actually make real point forecast. Don't say likely. Say, this is 63%. Do that across a lot of different forecasts and you can find out when I say 63%, how close to 63% of the time does this thing occur. So it's like when we say something like likely, it's a way for us to say, well, I know it's uncertain, but I also don't want to be wrong. And I don't really want to communicate what I'm saying precisely because I'm afraid that I'll be wrong. It's understanding that there's some uncertainty, but trying to get out of that bind. Whereas it's much better to say, I believe that there's a 63% chance that inflation will resolve by November of 2024. And this is the way that great forecasters speak. And then they update their forecast as they go along. And it sounds weird because it sounds very certain, but it's not because you're saying there's some percentage of the time that I believe this is going to occur.

    - **Note:** Toss out probabilities associate with forecasts even if those may not be very accurate it’s important to quantify certainty and uncertainty. Improbable things happen and probable things fail to happen but that doesn’t mean either are right or wrong. Don’t have a crazy opinion of yourself. Debate disagreement not agreement more. Do this independently. Figure out ev and if there are any wipe out tail risks. What happens if I’m wrong is an important question. You can’t recognize the ev if you’re dead. It’s not just the likelihood it’s the odds and the total bet. Paramutual betting. Important to quantify your subjective judgement. Probablistic thinking is tough in a deterministic world that we need to recognize it’s still probablistic just because the end state is deterministic
