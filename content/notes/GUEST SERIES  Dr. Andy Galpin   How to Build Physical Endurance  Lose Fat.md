### Highlights

- Exercise Snacks: Improving your health bite by bite
  Key takeaways:
  - Exercise snacks can be done in as little as 20 seconds and can be done multiple times a day.
  - The mode of exercise does not matter, only the exertion.
  - The details to pay attention to are the frequency and duration of the exercise snacks.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  There's a whole bunch of things you can do in under one minute that are convenient to do. And there's a wonderful set of papers out of a couple of laboratories in Canada that championed this idea that's called exercise snacks. So there's a bunch of, there's a series of studies that have been done here that are really interesting. And they've looked at a couple of things that are noteworthy. One of them is a 20 second bout of all out work. And this is actually done in workers in an office. And so what they had them do is run upstairs. I believe it was about 60 steps is what it took them. Something along the order of 20 seconds, exactly. And they repeated that about once every four hours. So really, you go to work, you get, you know, put your coffee and your bag down or whatever. You run up a flight of stairs 20 seconds later, then you go right back to work at lunch. And before you go home, you sort of repeat it there. And if you repeat that, that's multiple times a week, you're going to do that. I think they, in one of the interventions, it was three times a week for six weeks, 18 total times you did that. And what you'll see is a noticeable improvement. This is statistically significant improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness, specifically VO2 max, as well as a number of cognitive benefits, work productivity, et cetera. That can happen in as little as 20 seconds. You don't have to go to the gym. You don't have to shower. You don't have to do anything like that. Just find the stairs, run up and down them a few times. Now you may have noticed you actually sort of caught me yesterday. I did that right here, right? I was just, I, we had a little bit of a break. I was feeling an energy law. I ran up the stairs three or four times. Felt a lot better. So that can actually also help. They ran another study where they looked at that following a giant high glycemic index meal. And what they saw and then they took insulin measures and a whole bunch of other biological markers associated that you want to be paying attention to the high glycemic index meal. And they looked at those immediately an hour, three hours, six hours as opposed. And it was very clear that same intervention was able to improve post-plandial glucone. Coase control, insulin and a whole bunch of other factors in addition to that. So if you are the sort of type who's like, wow, I'm in an office all day, maybe also had a giant high glycemic index meal. Not the best approach, but a little bit of mitigation there can just be running up a flight of stairs or doing something like that for as little as 20 seconds. So there's a lot of magic and power and maximal exertion.
  Speaker 2
  If one does not have access to a flight of stairs at work, could they do jumping jacks? Absolutely.
  Speaker 1
  I mean, you could do anything you really wanted. It's not the mode of exercise that matters here. It is simply the exertion. You just get up as hard as you can. You could do burpees. You could do any number of things. You could sprint down your road, down the hallway back and forth. The mode is just something that was easy for the scientists to control. X number of steps, people could do it and you're going to fall, hurt yourself, things like that.
  Speaker 2
  Just to remind me, it's once every four hours, one minute of all hours. 20 seconds. Oh, 20 seconds. 20 seconds of essentially all out exertion while remaining safe, not going so fast up the stairs or doing jumping jacks. Certainly not down the stairs. Up the stairs, please. Resculators don't count. Well, I suppose they count if they're, if you're moving, if you're not remaining on the same steps. In fact, in an airport recently, I saw somebody walking against the conveyor while talking on the phone, while waiting for their flight to take off. I thought it's genius, right? It looked a little awkward. Who cares? Yeah, but it was very cool.
  Speaker 1
  I have looked awkward in every airport I've been in for the last 15 years for these exact reasons, doing wild stuff like that.
  Speaker 2
  Well, nothing's more awkward than not being able to walk to the end of the terminal simply because one isn't familiar with walking that far, carrying a couple of suitcases. There you go. Yeah, that's the other fit test. This is the case carrier in the airport. I love this. So once every four hours, 20 seconds, so maybe once when arriving to work, once four hours in and then four hours, I must be able to probably work somewhere eight plus or minus two hours.
  Speaker 1
  Now, one thing I actually really want to make clear because your audience is so incredible. They tend to be really excited about these protocols and they follow them exactly as written. That's not exactly how science works. So it doesn't necessarily have to be every four hours. It doesn't have to be three times a day. It doesn't have to be 20 seconds. They literally built that protocol because it was really trying to replicate a real-life scenario. Maybe you're in an office building, you're generally there for eight hours. Let's see if you did one every sort of. So if you want to do it four times a week, great. If you can do it only 10 seconds, amazing. You're probably going to get the same benefits. Those are not the details to pay attention to. The detail to pay attention to is every so often, multiple times a day, try to get your heart rate up really quickly. It doesn't require sweating, doesn't require anything else. There's no warm-up associated with it. Again, you need a minute break in between meetings or whatever and you can sprint up them. I do this all the time in my house when you have those days when you're on like seven straight hours of zooms, et cetera. You can get out of 20 seconds. I run to my garage, which is over there. I hop on the airbike and I will just smash out 30 seconds as fast as I can and then walk right back in.
  Speaker 2
  Love it. Yeah. I'm going to start. ([Time 0:08:51](https://share.snipd.com/snip/99351584-81ce-458f-a4ed-421c4aad31bc))
    - **Note:** A little bit of maximum exertion in the middle of a day can help you reset your mind and re energize you. 20 seconds max exertion every 4 hours
