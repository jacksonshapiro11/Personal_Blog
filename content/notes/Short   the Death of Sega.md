### Highlights

- Confusion and Flops: The Strange Release of Sega Saturn
  Key takeaways:
  - Retailers, third-party companies, and the market were not prepared for the Sega Saturn launch
  - Recent market confusion with past Sega products led to consumer confusion about the Sega Saturn launch
  - The lack of marketing and groundwork severely impacted the success of the Sega Saturn launch
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  This makes no sense. There's no Sonic game ready. There's no third-party games at all. The retailers aren't prepped. They don't know to expect this. There's been no marketing. None of the groundwork has been laid. In fact, everybody thinks this thing is coming out in September.
  Speaker 2
  It's really weird because it's like everyone's sort of recent hero, the David versus the Goliath of Nintendo seems like they should be firing on all cylinders, but you have the market confusion with the 32 X and the Sega Saturn. And now Sega Saturn sooner? What the heck's going on?
  Speaker 1
  Right. On top of this maybe forgivable Sega CD thing that happened, you know, a year or two before, like this whole thing is just weird. So on the back of this, the Saturn flops. ([Time 0:12:58](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d650b0dc-db3d-4944-8ec9-68756f9f7254))
    - **Note:** The next console flops and really the strategy was rushed and poorly executed. From the CD adapter instead of a new console to the Saturn being rushed and coming to market early without any games. The company had no direction.
- The failure of Sega Saturn and criticism towards Japanese management of Sega in Console Wars
  Key takeaways:
  - The Saturn flopped and only sold just over nine million units compared to the Genesis, which sold 30 million units.
  - Tom Kalinsky, the CEO of Sega America, and other Sega America executives spoke diplomatically, but criticized the Japanese management of Sega during this time.
  - Sega of America fought against all of the Japanese parent company's decisions and were jealous of Sega of America's success with the Genesis, which only sold really well in America, Europe, and South America.
  - The author of Console Wars draws an analogy that Japan is the parent and America is the child in this situation.

  Speaker 1
  Right. On top of this maybe forgivable Sega CD thing that happened, you know, a year or two before, like this whole thing is just weird. So on the back of this, the Saturn flops. It sells just over nine million units compared to the Genesis, which sold 30 million units. And if you read the book, Console Wars by Blake Harris, he spends a lot of time with Tom Kalinsky, the CEO of Sega of America and interviews him and Tom and the other folks who were at Sega of America at this time, like they're somewhat diplomatic, but they just kind of lambast the Japanese management of Sega at this point in time. They say that they at Sega of America fought against all of these decisions, that the Japanese parent company was jealous of Sega of America's success with the Genesis because the Genesis sold really well in America.
  Speaker 2
  It didn't sell as well in Japan.
  Speaker 1
  No, all of the Genesis's success was in America, Europe and South America. It basically did nothing in Japan.
  Speaker 2
  And in Console Wars, the author draws this great analogy of Japan is the parent and America is the child. So shouldn't the parent be proud of the child's success? But in reality, the way that it actually was going on is that Japan and America were sort of sibling markets and the parents favorite child used to be Japan. And as the parent showed more favoritism toward America, the Japan leadership sort of retaliated and found ways to kick and scream and say, hey, you need to pay more attention to me.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, and Sega at this point, of course, is a Japanese company and the board is Japanese and at the end of the day, Japan wins here. ([Time 0:13:33](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5b69b3c3-c3d6-49ad-ad67-46bdeba06f68))
    - **Note:** There was also power games and infighting between sega of Japan and sega of America.
- CSK Holdings: The Investors Behind Sega's Buyout
  Key takeaways:
  - CSK Holdings financed Sega's buyout and became its sponsor.
  - Holly bought Sega for only $38 million despite its $214 million revenue in the previous year due to the home video game crash in America.
  - Sega's management bought the dip and knew the arcade business was still viable despite the crash.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Yes, actually.
  Speaker 2
  There's a transaction in 1984. It looks like the investor name is CSK Holdings. Yes, that's it.
  Speaker 1
  So CSK Holdings was a public Japanese company that Rosen and Nakayama knew the management of they financed this buyout. They were like the PE shop. They were the sponsor of this transaction. Oh, interesting. And this is how Sega becomes an actual Japanese company, even though they were started by Americans to serve military bases back in the day. Right.
  Speaker 2
  OK, so holy bought out by Gulf and Western, then holy spun out. Yes, they bought the whole thing for only $38 million. Like this is ridiculous.
  Speaker 1
  This company, which is legendary in the arcade industry, did $214 million in the year ended six months before this.
  Speaker 2
  Why did they value it so little?
  Speaker 1
  This is the thing because of the home video game crash in America. Video games in general just became this toxic asset that nobody wanted to own, especially Paramount and Warner Brothers was divesting Atari. So the arcade business got hit by the crash, but it actually was fine. And so this was just an amazing deal.
  Speaker 2
  Management bought the dip because they knew that they weren't actually really affected by this boy. Did they ever? ([Time 0:25:38](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7f930d7b-0679-49c2-9c71-09436d9f0727))
    - **Note:** Michael Eisner and we’re involved in sega in the early year gulf and western owned it who owned paramount but sold it in the video game crash for $38mm despite sega doing 260mm in revenue the year before. Market psychology toxic asset. Sega was a top player in the arcade space.
- The Innovator's Dilemma and the Differences between Arcade and Home Console Technology
  Key takeaways:
  - Arcade technology and hardware worked in constant iteration with every game being its own proprietary hardware cabinet based on designs called boards
  - Nintendo and the home console business were not a threat to the arcade business because the types of games and cycles were different
  - Sega's R&D team worked with a core base, such as the System 16, which they based the Genesis on
  Transcript:
  Speaker 3
  And on the one hand, it's an innovator's dilemma.
  Speaker 2
  On the other hand, I have to imagine arcade stayed a very good cash flow business for a long time. It's not like that was actually going away.
  Speaker 1
  Well, let's get into it. So Nintendo and the NES and the Super NES and the home console business turned out was never really a threat to the arcade business because the way arcade technology and hardware worked was very different than the console cycle and the types of games were different in the arcades. It was all iterative. It was constant iteration. Every game that came out was its own proprietary hardware cabinet and they were based on designs are called boards. There are arcade boards, but you could tweak it each time. You think about what Sega is pushing with all their add-ons to the home console. Of course, that would make sense to them. That's the way their R&D team worked. They'd have like a core base, you know, call it the system 16, which was Sega's kind of base 16 bit arcade platform that they based the Genesis on. ([Time 0:28:59](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d2b0dbdb-0031-45ff-b34b-69a82f4240b6))
    - **Note:** Sega was an arcade company and the console market came up as a passion project offshoot that ended up being very successy
- Sega's Innovation in Arcade Games: The Virtual Series and Virtual Fighter
  Key takeaways:
  - Sega was a leader in arcade gaming in the early to mid 90s
  - Virtual Fighter was a significant innovation in 3D polygonal technology
  - Sega's virtual series predated Super Mario 64 as the first 3D video game consumers found popular
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So coming out of this era and then into the early and mid 90s, Sega's arcade unit is just killing it. They've had those hits in the 80s. Everybody got super wealthy. And then they start really pushing the envelope on technology. There was a ton of innovation coming out of Sega. They developed the first real modern great 3D games. We all think now of Super Mario 64 as being the first 3D video game that consumers used and loved actually years before, Sega put out the virtual series in the arcades. So this was virtual racing, virtual a cop, and most importantly, virtual fighter. Now, this game, virtual fighter, which was a fighting game, it used 3D polygonal technology. If you think back to 16-bit Super Nintendo games, they're flat. They're 2D 3D games like think Mario 64. You're running around in a 3D world. All of the environments and characters are built using polygonal math. We talked about this a lot on the Nvidia episode. Right.
  Speaker 2
  Triangles. Triangles.
  Speaker 1
  This is new. Sega is the one that actually brought really good games to market with this. And it was all in the arcades. So virtual fighter, when it comes out in 1993 is so popular. Sega sells over 40,000 virtual fighter cabinets worldwide at a price of like $10,000 plus per cabinet. ([Time 0:31:26](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2fc4a143-c606-4bb5-a67c-557f0c8a9515))
    - **Note:** The arcades was where the innovation was much more iterative and fast paced. The 3D polygonal math set the scene for the tech that the play station would be based on.
- The Birth of the PlayStation: Bringing Arcade Technology to the Home Market
  Key takeaways:
  - Sony entered the video game market in the mid-1990s with the PlayStation
  - Sony convinced non-Sega arcade manufacturers to bring their new games to the PlayStation
  - The PlayStation was an arcade killer when it first came out, offering technological firepower in the home market
  Transcript:
  Speaker 3
  And they have the balance sheet to subsidize it.
  Speaker 2
  So they can take a strategy of coming into the home with very, very good technology at a price point that consumers could afford. Yeah.
  Speaker 1
  So here we are now the end of 1993 into 1994. Sony has announced that they're coming out with the PlayStation. They're all in on entering the video game market. They start going around and talking to all of the non Sega arcade manufacturers. Namco midway in the US Konami and they start convincing them to bring all of their new arcade games directly to the PlayStation. When it first comes out in end of 1994 in Japan and then 1995 in the US, it's an arcade killer. That's what it is billed as. It becomes so much more than that over time. It's Grand Theft Auto, it's Final Fantasy, it's all that. But in the beginning, the vision for the PlayStation was we're going to take the technological firepower of the arcades and we are going to bring that in a way that Nintendo can't and Sega won't into the home market. ([Time 0:34:48](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6d287005-3071-4c9f-9054-76294a0f12f7))
    - **Note:** The play station rode into the living room as an arcade killer. Nintendo couldn’t invest the money and take the losses to establish dominance and sega wouldn’t because it cannibalized the core arcade business. Innovators delima. Sony also partnered with segas biggest competitors to make games.
- The Battle of Consoles: Sega vs Sony in 1995
  Summary:
  Steve Kielinski was the CEO of Sega of America. He announced in May 1995 that he would be leaving his position to work for Sony. The PlayStation came out four months later on September 9th, 1995. Steve: This is probably the greatest moment in video game industry history.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  And he's basically doing this because Japan has said either you are doing this or we will find a new CEO for Sega of America who can do this. Yes, three ninety nine. That is the Sega Saturn price point available today, May 11th, 1995.
  Speaker 1
  So Kielinski finishes his speech. He walks off stage. They usher everybody out of the room. They turn it over. They get ready for the next keynote of the day, which is going to be Sony. Sony keynote starts a couple hours later. Olaf Olafsson, who's the president and head of all of Sony America. So like not just the PlayStation, all of Sony's businesses. He gets on stage. He starts giving his presentation. He says that the PlayStation will release in the US on September 9th, 1995. So say it goes like, whew, great. They're not moving it up. We're going to beat him to the punch. We're live today. We got a four month head start. Let's go. And then Olaf invites the new head of Sony computer entertainment. America won Steve race, formally of Sega of America up to the podium to give a quote unquote brief presentation. He walks slowly up to the podium. He's got a large stack of notes. He places them down on the lectern. He shuffles them around. He waits a beat. He's ready to give his big speech. He looks up, he looks at the audience and he says two ninety nine. And then he picks up his notes and he walks off stage. And this is, I think, most people in the industry, I think, would agree that this is the greatest moment in all of video game industry history. ([Time 0:41:39](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d69bd33e-7288-4b70-8df5-bae508926753))
    - **Note:** Sega sees Sony about to crush them and scrambles the jets but don’t undercuts them on price by $100 with better tech it was the death of sega in the arcade and home business
