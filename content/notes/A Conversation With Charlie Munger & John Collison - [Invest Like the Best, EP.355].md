### Highlights

- Episode AI notes
  1. Selling what one would personally buy and working with reliable people are simple yet highly effective principles that are often overlooked. Consistently applying these principles throughout life can lead to significant advantages and the building of trust with others.
  2. Cheating and dishonesty can be found in various aspects of life, but win-win scenarios based on voluntary transactions contribute to the success of civilization. Capitalism promotes these win-win situations and the development of society. One example of a business that exemplifies this concept is Dairy Queen, a Berkshire enterprise that offers affordable treats to parents and children.

- Follow simple advice well. Nothing is too complicated but just master and stick to the fundamentals without getting too out of touch. The map is not the territory a business could have the same income statement but one could be more honest or better. Understand the games your playing and stick inside your circle of competence. Natural capital efficiency is vital in a business not manufactured capital efficiency. Business is choosing the customers you want and don’t want. Different fields aren’t multidisciplinary enough and become dogmatic. You need to keep your eyes open and learn from the best of what others have figured out. There’s always white space to learn and the current world is stuck in their dogma that creates opportunities ([Time 0:09:51](https://share.snipd.com/snip/950b43da-0e6f-4381-bd95-51129f0e89ec))

  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  All kinds of people, if you're a carny operator, you're trying to cheat people on the little gambling games. And they do it all day. If you're selling drugs, that's another way of cheating. And your whole life you want to be on a win-win basis. Because it builds and it's like capitalism. It gives these effects that multiply. And there's so much of it we have. That's why civilization works as well. It does as so much of it is win-win. But there are all kinds of people that are looking for ways to cheat people. We had a guy with us when I was in the military. Everybody called him Honest John. And of course, they called him that because he was totally crooked. And if it wasn't dishonorable and crooked, he didn't, they would sound. He wouldn't consider any proposition that wasn't sleazy in Neverland, everywhere. He was trying to screw people out of money. But how much better if you have a voluntary transaction where both sides are happy on a win-win basis? That's perfect. And capitalism in such a system causes this flourishing civilization. Of course, it's the way to go.
  Speaker 2
  Which Berkshire businesses do you think are most emblematic or everything is win-win?
  Speaker 1
  Take Dairy Queen. We have all these little shacks. Pretty real North where they're just open in the summertime. Because you're doing it in so much ice cream in the winter. All the parents come and get their cheap hot dogs and ice cream cones and so forth. ([Time 0:55:11](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b5ab6e89-944e-4e38-b6d8-d67957e5321d))
