  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  The mark to it. And then the mark to it. I've had so many problems and very good actually ever happened. And I think it goes back forever.
  Speaker 2
  We have the, the Milton quote that I was just talking to someone about yesterday. The mind can make a heaven of hell and a hell of heaven. Right. Like it doesn't matter. And I think this is part of what you talk about in the books, but it doesn't matter how successful or unsuccessful you are, how great things are going or how terrible they're going. If there's something wrong in here, if there's some misalignment in here, it will be awful. Meanwhile, if there is an alignment here, you can figure out a way through that because it's just a temporary external thing. Yeah.
  Speaker 1
  And, you know, and it just makes sense. And this is how it works. The more the inner game is better, the faster you can get through the bad times, you know, or at least the bad times seem like you're getting going faster. And in the end, that's, yeah, it's like, you know, we both know people who are written miserable. We'll think why.
  Speaker 2
  I would say most of them.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah. More often than not. No matter having extra resources, but it's the inner game and it is the most important game there is.
  Speaker 2
  We I think what happens is the misery or the unpleasantness or whatever, it, instead of dealing with it, it manifests itself like you go, well, I'm going to focus on this thing over here, right? I'm going to really learn how to play the guitar or I'm going to really throw myself into building this company, right? Or I'm going to do X, Y, or Z. And that energy, that misplaced energy is so forceful. Like there's a Stephen Pressfield as this joke about how no one's ever seen Hitler's art that basically it was it was easier for Hitler to take over Germany and try to conquer the world than to be an artist. That's hysterical. That's so funny. And although actually it's the joke is funny. It's not actually true because you can see Hitler's art. The US government owns almost all of it. It's in this vault. They seized it after the war. They didn't want there to be a market for Hitler's art afterwards. But the idea is that like, you know, dealing with your shit is really hard. Getting good at stuff is hard, but it's easier than dealing with your shit. So what happens is people get really good at something. They make a lot of money. They spend a lot of time on it, always hoping to never have to deal with the shit, but that can't go on forever eventually you come to a moment where it's inescapable that the shit is there. Your wife is telling you you have to deal with it. You know, some public scandal is telling you you have to deal with it. You know, some haunting misery is telling you have to deal with it. Your kids are making you what whatever it is. There's something that forces you to reckon with it. And then you you are forced to stare at this enormous thing you've built essentially as an escape from the thing you've been putting off doing and dealing with.

    - **Note:** Importance of inner alignment of the mind to conquer anything. As long as you’re mentally ok you can do anything but if you’re not even the best days suck. The inner day or game is the most important game. Misplaced energy. Dealing with your shit is hard it’s easier to do or build something then deal with your emotions but eventually the bill comes due.
