  Speaker 1
  So snipers, there's one guy out there alone practicing his craft over and over and over again. The target is 400 yards away, four football fields. He has to get in his truck, drive to the target, set it up, and drive back to where we're standing. He gets his gun with the scope, takes aim, one shot. Then we get in the truck with him and drive back to the target. He hit it dead fucking center. Michael asked him how many people use that target range, and he said, just me. He was alone working on this one shot over and over again. So when people in the military need someone who can hit that kind of target, they call him. No one knows what this guy does every day to be this good. People just know that he can deliver results. Figure out what you do, then do it and do it better than anyone else, and then let everything else you do build around that. And that's something Michael talks about because now, you know, obviously he's one of the greatest, if not the greatest basketball player of all time. But if you look at what he's done and he's one of the best entrepreneurs too. And his whole point was like, his game was his best endorsement. He said, my dedication to the game led to all this other stuff. You know, the fact that he made, I guess, like a billion or $2 billion selling his NBA team. The fact that he's got this crazy deal with Nike, that he's been getting 5% royalty. I think he's going to make something like $300 million this year.

    - **Note:** Figure out what you do better than anyone focus deeply on it and that creates leverage. Be the only deep focus and commitment the best sharp shooter in the world would spend hours just firing his rifle no one knew what he was doing to be so good but he always got the call for missions deep commitment to craft. You need to keep it simple and focus on fundamentals over everything so the basics and do it better than anyone master the fundamentals. They never stoped learning constantly learning from the best and trusting intuition. Build then trust intuition. Seek difficulty and pressure. Most people run from pressure but these guys embraced it. Held people to absolute high standards didn’t let the bar drop put more pressure on himself then the outside world ever could. Hire the best absolute people even if there’s is no spot because talent is key. Talent is the best asset class a players only. Yiu need to be uncompromising in your commitment excellence is the capacity to take pain. Jordan was up between 5-7 every day after games in the gym as people were sleeping. Kobe was at the gym the night he was drafted while everyone else was partying. These people were relentlessly consistent over time.

  Speaker 1
  It's not making the podcast or growing the podcast and he's right about that It's very similar to what Michael Jordan would do every year on Labor Day So every year on Labor Day Michael Would shut our by Labor Day Michael would shut down everything outside of basketball and just train three workouts a day workout golf workout lunch golf break Workout dinner bed every Day no commercial suits No promotional tours no events just work because he knew better than anyone else that all the outside stuff was the result of hard work on the Inside not the other Way around shoe deals and commercials don't make you an icon being unstoppable Makes you an icon and being unstoppable only comes with hard work My game was my biggest endorsement my Dedication to the game led to all the other stuff Another trait that Tim observed in both Kobe and Michael is the fact that they have a hard time trusting other people are Maybe not maybe We put this is like they trust themselves more than anybody else There's a great line in Michael's biography on episode 212 or says Jordan mostly believed in himself in Mike He trusted All others were open to question and so Tim has some ideas on why this is Maybe the case trusting others is the same as giving up control and they usually have a painfully hard time with That They have this in common at some point they learned that they can only trust themselves Maybe it was a lesson they learned in childhood or something that happened later in life But It forced them to rely on the sheer power of their gut instinct and they realized that their survival and succeed They could never take their hands off the wheel And finally the last story From this book I want to share with you as this is a story about Kobe. ([Time 0:35:09](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6e44ea67-74aa-474d-976e-e8002a8e55b1))
    - **Note:** These people were only focused on winning they realized that everything came from their success so in the offseason Jordan shut the world out and practiced. He realized the shoe deals came from performance not the other way around. Focus on one thing only they do whatever it takes. Super competitive Jordan at 50 went to a bob cats practice and beat the starters with the 2nd unit as the owner. Jordan and Kobe bullied players and were assholes but this also led to their dominance this was their mentality. They would push people and respect those that stood up for themselves and pushed back. Winning to Jordan was pushing people farther then they could go challange people when they didn’t want to be challenged earned the right to do that. He made people live at a certain standard if they were on the team it was who he was he couldn’t play any different. Winning is the punishment you take before it it can be glorious but it can really fuck you up. Everyone wanted to be like Mike Mike wanted to be himself. He knew how to think and didn’t want to be told what to think like all the greats before him. <— important. Kobe would text Mike in the middle of the night with questions always learning. The greats figure out what works for them without caring what works for others. Michael had the most disciplined game day routine ever. He outsourced decisions that weren’t important his routine being so consistent allowed him to focus on the complexity of the games.
- Unshakeable Confidence and Relentless Self-Belief
  Summary:
  Having an unshakeable confidence and relentless self-belief is crucial for success.
  Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant displayed this through their insatiable work ethic and unwavering belief in themselves. They were willing to work at any hour, prioritize their training, and bet on themselves without a hint of self-doubt.
  Their confidence was so strong that it became a self-fulfilling prophecy, propelling them to greatness.
  In contrast to those who wait for direction and lack self-confidence, Jordan and Bryant took charge of their lives and careers, inspiring those around them to have the same level of belief.
  Their approaches were exemplified in Michael Jordan's quote to a potential teammate, 'We're winning with you or without you,' showcasing their absolute certainty in their abilities and the outcomes they aimed for.

  Speaker 1
  He was insatiable for game film He also never slept so he said you know Kobe would text him work And they would he'd want to work out from like two in the morning four in the morning three A.m. All different times And so Tim says I never slept during those years I just napped because you never know when he'd be ready to go back to work MJ knew when to stop Kobe didn't you would never Find MJ on a court at 4 a.m. He slept at night because he knew sleep was part of his training But above all they had this in common they each possessed an unshakeable confidence in themselves that never wavered And You see this in this recruiting call the Bulls asked Michael Jordan to be a part of remember I said remember that phone call between the Portland Trailblazers and Bobby Knight Hey, Should we draft Sam Bowie? Should we draft Michael Jordan? He's like playing at center the Bulls management asked Michael to be part of a conference call with Sam Bowie It was a free agent at the time everyone made their pitch to Sam about why he Should join the Bulls and etc Etc and then it was MJ's turn and he just said Sam you comment or not. We're winning with her without you His belief in himself was so powerful that he never doubted the outcome And that's something that they share with a lot of greats inside and outside Of sports In fact, Sam Walton talked about having that same exact mentality when he was building Walmart He said in his autobiography shortly before he died He says it never occurred To me that I might lose to me It was almost as if I had a right to win Thinking like that often seems to turn into some sort of self-fulfilling prophecy And I think that relentless self-belief Is important and avoiding the following very very few people are willing or able to bet on themselves They become the assistant manager of their own lives waiting for direction and Approval from some higher authority Because they don't feel confident enough to make decisions and take action on their own Kobe and Michael where the opposite of that and Everybody Around him knew this this is one of my favorite Michael stories from early in his career in the early days of Michael's career A reporter asked his coach Doug Collins about his strategy For coaching the greatest player in the game It's pretty simple said Collins give him the ball and get the fuck out of the way Michael elaborated on this mindset in the last dance My mentality Was to go out and win at any cost if you don't want to live that regimented mentality Then you just don't need to be alongside of me because I'm going to ridicule you until you get on the same ([Time 0:56:28](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f305b498-b4cd-4d4f-96b8-fba544e1e0c2))
    - **Note:** Deep belief in themselves. They felt they had a right to win. Jordan on a FA recruiting call after the pitch was made just said we’re winning with or without you so are you in. Relentless self belief don’t become the assistant manager of your life waiting on higher approval. Make decisions and take actions on your own. Win at every costs. They never ask someone something they would never ask of themselves. It’s not being an asshoke it’s just asking a lot from yourself and asking the same from everyone else around you. Quality of the work is more important than anyone’s feelings. Mind more important than feelings. Champions behave like champions before they’re champions. Mike believes in deep loyalty and winning you can’t ride the fence need that deep commitment. He ripped up a team mates puma stuff with a knife abs threw it in the dumpster then told him to call his guy at Nike tomorrow for new stuff he told his trainer he had to wear Nike not converse. He’s loyal or not. Never goes down to your level. Keep up he was unapologetically extreme. He had no off switch he would compete relentlessly in exhibitions. Focused on simplicity over all stop adding start deleting. Never complacent with achievements.
- Embrace Self-Doubt and Time is Limited
  Summary:
  Education is invaluable and can't be taken away.
  Self-doubt is common among successful people, but they don't succumb to it. Kobe emphasized having self-doubt and fear of failure but not giving in to it.
  The biggest mistake is assuming there is plenty of time, as time is limited, and it's crucial to seize wins without delay.

  They can take everything away from you your house your money or clothes your car But one thing they can't take is your education and what you've learned and the one thing you can count On if you do indeed lose everything is that education and I mentioned earlier that Michael and Tim would talk about the self-doubt the butterflies You know the nervousness that would Happen before game those people are performing well not be in absence of fear But in spite of it and so there's another example of Kobe saying the same thing Kobe says I have self doubt I have self doubt I have insecurity. I have fear of failure. I have nights where I showed up to the arena I'm like my back hurts my feet hurt my knees hurt. I don't have it tonight. I just want to chill We all have self doubt you don't deny it, but you also don't capitulate to it. I love that You do not capitulate to yourself doubt you embrace it And Towards the end of this book Tim is reflecting on his relationship with Kobe It was written after Kobe died and I think This is a very important lesson He says Kobe's impatience was legendary the biggest mistake we make in life is thinking that we have time The longer it takes time to capture your wins The less time you have to enjoy them And that's the biggest thing we don't know how much time we have the biggest mistake we have in life is thinking We have time you can see this in one of The last interviews Kobe did he's talking about the next 20 years of his life He had no idea and I hate even saying those words I hate the fact that ([Time 1:10:01](https://share.snipd.com/snip/39af62d4-f85a-414f-b16b-ee1cf4e93854))
