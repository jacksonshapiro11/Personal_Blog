### Highlights

- History and geography
  We live in a world that has been shaped by geography up until this point but due to technological advances the world is getting smaller and geography less important
    - **Tags:** #geography, #technology-(reducing-geographic-impacts)
    - **Note:** The impact of geography is getting less important and this is helping shape the world.
- History and Biology
  Life is driven by competition and selection through that competition (Darwin) which leads to selection with the ultimate goal of breeding and being most fit to live and pass genes on. Competition is the frame in which selection and further breeding happens and competition does not mean you vs the world but it can actually be helped in competition by cooperation, so cooperation is key to competition.
  “Freedom and equality are sworn and everlasting enemies and when one prevails the other dies.” Unchecked freedom leads to inequality of outcomes and then different status (US) while totally equality leads to communist Russia.
  “Only the man who is below average in economic ability desires equality; those who are conscious of superior ability desire freedom”

    - **Note:** Cooperation is key to competition in the evolutionary sense and may give an insight into the value of altruism . freedom and equality are sworn enemies and you need to balance the two but optimize for freedom. Only the less talented want equality.
- History and Race
  The environment makes a civilization and anything attributed to “race” is a non-sequiturs and complete nonsense. Attributing things to race is a method of substitution.
    - **Tags:** #race, #subsitution-(in-psychology), #surface-vs-conplex-issue
    - **Note:** Race is a substitution for a deeper issue. In the south it was class struggle that was hidden by race and kept order.
- Character
  Most of human evolution is socialization. Chesterton’s fence argument in that 99% of new ideas are crap so the barrier to entry (burden of proof) for a new idea should be high and rigorously tested before replacement and you should understand why something is done that way before you change it.
    - **Tags:** #favorite, #socialized-into-society, #human-nature-remains-constant, #chestertons-fence, #social-creatures-(humans)
    - **Note:** We should change our minds but we need to rigorously test new ideas.
- Morals
  Morals reflect the time we live in. History has been writing through a lense of moral superiority showcasing only the most noble and neglecting all the negative immoralities. Morals go in waves some times are extremely moral met by a time of high immorality, but generally speaking the barriers of morality are very fluid and change with the time often, so things humans do that are considered immoral may be adopted from another age when that trade was not only moral but selected. One should be very careful to judge morality because history is a lot clearer in hindsight and the beliefs or morality society currently holds is apt to change.

    - **Note:** Morals are a mosaic not a rule and they adapt and flow over time. You cannot judge someone by their actions as morals are a dynamic system. Human nature is cyclical and views fade in and out of fashion rarely do humans find deep truth. History biased by victors and morals are relative
- Religion 
  This argument takes a more abstract view of religion that I agree with.
  Religion is an important part of a well-functioning society as it is an easy way to imbed meaning in someone’s life. It gives people hope when all seems awful, but when it becomes manipulated the power it has can lead to bad ends. Religion and the values it has around morality are good grounds for a society, but the underlying nature of religion is bad.
  “As long as there is poverty there will be gods”
  “Even the skeptical historian develops a humble respect for religion since he sees it functioning and seemingly indispensable in every land and age. To the unhappy the suffering the bereaved the old it has brought supernatural comforts values by millions of souls as more precious than any natural aid. It has helped parents and teachers to discipline the young. It has conferred meaning and dignity upon the lowliest of existence and through its sacraments has made for stability by transforming human covenants into solem relationships with god. It has kept the poor from murdering the rich. For since natural inequlity of men dooms many of us to poverty or defeat some supernatural hope may be the sole alternative to despair. Destroy that hope and class war is intensified. Heaven and utopia are buckets in a well; when one goes down the other goes up; when religion declines communism grows.
- Economics
  “We conclude that the concentration of wealth is natural and inevitable, and is periodically alleviated by violent and peaceful partial redistribution. In this view all economic history is the slow heartbeat of the social organism, a vast systole and diastole of contracting wealth and compulsive recirculation”
  “Perhaps it is one secret of their power that, having studied the fluctuation of prices, they know that history is inflationary, and that money is the last thing a wise man will hoard. The experience of the past leaves little doubt that every economic system must sooner or later rely on some form of the profit motive to stir individuals and groups to productivity. Substitutes like slavery, police supervision or ideological enthusiasm prove too unproductive too expensive or too transient. Normally and generally men are judge by their ability to produce- except in war where they are judged by their ability to destroy.”

    - **Note:** Men are judged by their ability to create to create enduring value mixed with a small time of destruction.
      Concentration of wealth and redistribution is inevitable and ever present. This concentration distribution is a cycle.
      History is inflationary and you should never hoard money but put that money to work in productive assets because money will always inflate. People need good incentives to work.
      concentration and redistribution of wealth inevitable invest in productive assets because cash inflates away
- Socialism
  Capitalism and socialism lead to the same end. Socialism has been very successful but there is more key man risk and neither can purely work a balance is needed, but the key regardless is that those in power of good and just because absolute power corrupts absolutely.

    - **Note:** Key man risk vs centralization of power. Checks on power in all systems because power corrupts. Good rulers are vital. Balance of powers
- War
  Due to natural competition between humans some form of war is inevitable and peace is the exception to the rule. (Check this against Talebs view on the subject in skin in the game_
  “There can only be peace when there is acknowledged supremacy or equal power. The causes of war are the same as the causes of competition between individuals”
    - **Tags:** #favorite, #hierarchy, #similarity-and-conflict, #war, #competition, #power, #supremecy
    - **Note:** Conflict is the natural state of humans and a hierarchy needs to be set clearly otherwise there will be a struggle for power.
- Government
  Governmental systems flows from authoritarian to democratic
  “Power natural converges to the center and it is ineffective when divided.”
  “The first condition of freedom is limitation make it absolute and it dies in chaos”
  “violent revolutions do not redistribute wealth but destroy it. There may be a redistribution of land but the natural inequality of man soon recreates in equality”…
  …“The only revolution is in the enlightenment of the mind and the improvement of character, the only real emancipation is individual, and the only real revolutionists are philosophers and saints”
  “The excessive increase of anything causes a reaction in the opposite direction”

    - **Note:** history is cyclical and divided power is basically not power
      True freedom is chaos and good government strikes the balance of correctly limited freedoms.
      Violent revolutions destroy wealth and redistribute land but the only revolution that creates progress is improvement in character and knowledge creation leading to the emancipation of the individual any wealth distribution concentrates over time. Revolutions don't work we just need to allow people to become themselves
      Freedom and equality are enemies power must be concentrated only revolution is emancipation of mind.
- Growth and decay
  Growth and decay is a product of human psychology. Growth happens through strong willed creative and adaptive people. Decay happens from people unable to live up to challenges. There are many reasons for cyclical growth and decay, but to succeed the best one can do is be resilient in the face of all challenges and adapt to the environment the best he can.
  “When a group or civilization declines it is through no mystic limitation, but through the failure of the leaders to meet the challenges of the changing times.”
  “Nations die. Old regions grow arid or suffer other change. Resilient man picks up his tools and his arts and moves on taking his memories with him.”

    - **Note:** Growth and decay happen in the cycles of life. First the innovators create then the optimizers exploit and the system as a whole suffers and this cycle continues to repeat.
      Growth happens through strong willed creatives who look at challenges with a smile and seek them.
      We fail because we can’t solve our problems then the strong just pick up and move on. We need to use good explanations and high agency to solve problems
- Final thoughts
  Men have not physiologically changed so any technological changes are just new means to the same ends, but are we making progress. There is still high inequality but we are controlling our environment more and making the world more fit for humans and better for the species overtime so progress is real.
    - **Tags:** #progress-(from-wrong-to-less-wrong), #human-nature-remains-constant
- “The historian will not mourn because he can see no meaning in the human existence except in which man puts into it; let it be pride that we ourselves may put meaning into our lives and sometimes a significance that transcends death.”
  -we embed meaning in our lives
  “Consider education not as the painful accumulation of facts and dates and reigns, nor merely the necessary prep of the individual to earn his keep in the world but the transmission of our mental, moral, technical, and aesthetic heritage as fully as possible to as many as possible for the betterment of the live of humans.”
  -learning the great models from others. Learn how to think. Von Bismarck fool learns from his experience.
  “Have we really outgrown intolerance or merely transferred it from religious to national, ideological, or racial hostilities?”
  -human nature is unchanging the lenses just chance.
  “History is so indifferently rich that a case for almost any conclusion can be made from a selection of instances.”
  -selection bias.

    - **Note:** We must put meaning in our lives
      Learning is developing frameworks and mental models. Meta learning and understanding mental models
      Intolerance and scapegoats are ever present morals are relative. Human nature is consant
      History written by the victors selection bias
