### Highlights

- The Framework for Evaluating New Skills and Initiatives: Uncapped Upside and Zero Downside
  Key takeaways:
  - When evaluating potential activities to spend time on, they should have uncapped upside and a worst-case scenario of building a transferable skill.
  - Writing on Twitter is a good example of an activity with potential exponential upside and low downside risk.
  - Playing a game with both exponential upside and zero downside can help build transferable skills that can be reapplied later.

  How I think about building new skills and taking on new initiatives right now is a framework from Tim Ferriss, which is when you're evaluating something to potentially spend your time on, it should have two things. It should have in some way uncapped upside such that if you do it, there's a chance of a lottery outcome, whatever you decide that lottery outcome is, but it's some kind of exponential upside. And the downside worst case is that you build a skill that then you could reapply elsewhere. And so I look at writing on Twitter as the perfect example of this. The upside is every single time you publish a tweet, it could go viral. Anyone on the world could see it, Elon Musk could see it, you could reach the most powerful people in the world. So if you publish 100 tweets, 200, 500, 1000, you're putting all those lottery tickets on goal, or in your pocket, worst case, you write 100 tweets for 100 days and you become a little bit better of a writer and no one reads them at all. And so I think for anyone thinking of how am I, what am I leveling up on right now? Make sure you're playing a game that has both exponential upside and zero downside because you would build a skill that then you could reapply later.

    - **Note:** Exponential upside and zero downside.
