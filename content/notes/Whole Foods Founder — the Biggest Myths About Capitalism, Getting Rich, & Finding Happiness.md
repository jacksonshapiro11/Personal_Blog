### Highlights

- Embrace Change, Remember Community
  Summary:
  In reflecting on past experiences, the importance of recognizing stakeholders, such as customers and neighbors, emerges, highlighting a communal spirit that once characterized smaller cities like Austin in 1981.
  There is a sense of loss regarding the awareness and willingness of community members to engage and support one another in times of crisis as society evolves. This underscores the need to balance progress with the retention of communal ties and proactive engagement in local issues.

  Speaker 1
  It was only in retrospect later that I realized we were onto something, that I could see the patterns because I hadn't really been exposed to any kind of stakeholder thinking before. But then later when I got exposed to it, I realized, yeah, they were stakeholders. They were our customers and neighbors. They cared about us. It also says something about that. This we're talking about now, May of 1981, literally 43 years ago. And the world's different back then than it is today. I really wonder whether people would come in and help clean up. Maybe they would. But Austin back then was a much smaller city than it is today. It was much more neighborhood based, much more, and it was just a different consciousness back then. It's, you know, as you make progress, you also lose certain things.

  You didn't want to give up after the flood. I mean, a lot of people, I think, would have just thrown their arms up in the air and sort of tried to walk away. ([Time 0:15:04](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b5c32cdf-0d88-49fb-a5cb-4020027d58f3))
    - **Note:** Meet customers where they are. He found a vegan grocery store first, but no one came needs to be right time and place. After 100 years flood his customers helped him clean and he never realized his banker personally guarantee his loan to save Whole Foods because he believed in him, and he only found out after he was dead. Little kindnesses love everyone. Never listen to criticism only builders. Always be serving your customers, especially when you’re in it an differentiating area. Take care of your employees and rewards them. Build and optimize the system. Some people don’t want to be ambitious and are happy to exist in their small sliver of the universe and some want to conquer the world. All the health food stores sold out to Whole Foods who wanted to conquer. Early on its mission driven but eventually you hire people and they see it as a career not a mission and you lose it.
- Embrace Competition to Fuel Resilience
  Summary:
  Facing challenges and skepticism from others can ignite a competitive spirit, driving entrepreneurs to persist against the odds.
  The experience of being told that a venture won't succeed often serves as a catalyst for determination rather than resentment. Embracing competition is not just beneficial but necessary for resilience; entrepreneurs must be prepared to endure setbacks and rise after each defeat.
  The essence of entrepreneurship lies in the continuous struggle against doubt, fostering a mindset that views challenges as opportunities for growth and increased capital.
  This resilience is crucial, as many people give up too soon when confronted with obstacles.

  I count four different coup attempts that occurred over the history of the company that I was able to beat back. Does that come from, like, is there a chip on your shoulder, or was there at the time that was sort of like, I'm going to prove you wrong?
  Speaker 1
  You know, I don't think I had sort of an inherent chip on my shoulder. It's just in some ways I'm a very competitive guy. And when people will tell me it won't work, you're going to fail. It's just I just, is it a chip on my shoulder? I think a chip on a shoulder is just something that you're just kind of mad at the world about. But when people would say what we were doing wasn't going to work, it just made me more determined. It's kind of like you get a competitive challenge from somebody. You could see I was talking about Erwan when we were off camera that I would love to be competing more aggressively with Erwan if I was still the CEO. But in general, I just, I love games. I love play. I love to compete. To me, it's really fun. And so when people would tell me that it's not going to work, it's like, I'd look at it and I would, you know, maybe they're, are they right? No, they're not right. I'm going to prove them not right. And as I would hear about a competitor, I just, I feel like that's not unusual for entrepreneurs. They're constantly being told what they're doing is not going to work. And so I think you have to have resilience. And that resilience, in my case, comes from kind of my competitive spirit, which is like, it would just make me more determined. I think that's a healthy thing, by the way, because too many people quit. They hit a roadblock or a setback. An entrepreneur gets set back so many times, you get knocked down and you got to get back up again. It's like if you're a fighter, eventually you might have to admit defeat eventually because you're going to die if you don't. But in general, you just want to keep getting up and see if you can get the next punch in. Anyway, that's how I'm sort of wired. Growth meant more money, more capital needed. ([Time 0:28:16](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a6df64a6-0819-4b76-bad4-60099f51fb65))
    - **Note:** Be a dog and just keep fighting. Doubters fuel you.
- Seize the Opportunity or Lose It
  Summary:
  Recognizing and acting on opportunities is crucial for success in business.
  The narrative emphasizes that significant opportunities may not present themselves frequently, and hesitation can lead to missed chances that competitors will seize. In this case, despite concerns about capability and resources, the decision to acquire a successful brand was essential to prevent competitors from gaining an advantage.
  The key was to leave the acquired entity largely independent, allowing it to thrive without forced integration.
  This approach demonstrates an effective strategy when facing growth opportunities—embracing risk and making decisive investments in strong brands while recognizing that the opportunity might not come again.

  Some of the acquisitions you made, you had choices. And one of the early ones was, what was the California chain, Mrs.? Mrs. Gucci's. Mrs. Gucci's. You didn't have the capital at that point to do the acquisition. You weren't ready for it.
  Speaker 1
  But we were public. And so we did have our currency. When my dad was objecting to that merger, he was saying, John, you have your hands full with bread and circus, which was still less than a year old. You don't have the capacity to take on the opposite coast. You're just, you're going to, you can't handle it. You're going to dilute your talent down. And he was right. But as I kept pointing out, it's like, you're right, but this opportunity is not going to come again. This is the crown jewel natural food store chain on the West Coast. If we don't take them, somebody else is. We'll have to figure out how to do it. And we did. And we did acquire them and we did figure out how to do it, mostly by leaving them alone. They were already, we didn't have to integrate them. They were Mrs. Gooch's. They already had great management. We pretty much just left them alone for the first few years and didn't try to integrate them into our company or culture. Just let them operate independently. That was the solution and it worked.
  Speaker 2
  That's a clever solution. I like the fact that, you know, often we're not ready for that next leap, that next level. We just finished, you know, maybe we just finished our position or something, but it doesn't come up again, right? If you didn't buy that, you weren't going to get another chance.
  Speaker 1
  One of the secrets to success in life and business, you have to seize the opportunities when they're there. These great opportunities, they don't come around every day. And he who hesitates lost, if you're not willing to seize that opportunity, somebody else will. You have to know when to go all in. It's, you know, when to make the bets. I knew they were very profitable. They had a great brand, very successful. Did not want to lose those guys. And plus, if we didn't get them, somebody else would, and they would end up being this great competitor for us down the road. We just had to make that deal. We paid a really rich price for it too. ([Time 0:39:05](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5c7f8d0f-eafe-4413-9f1e-5d1ecf8d3528))
    - **Note:** You need to take opportunities even when you’re scared or the time isn’t right you just need to send it. Nothing is ever perfect. Properties become available that will never be available again and you need to be reckless enough to act.

  Remember, 44 years is a long time. So there was a nice, long, creative run. And it didn't, like, change overnight. It just slowly, as the bureaucracy got bigger, as I was dealing more with problems rather than opportunities, my enjoyment of the business began to shift.
  Speaker 2
  Are there things that you said yes to that a more professional manager wouldn't have said yes to? I'm thinking things that don't make sense on a spreadsheet, but make sense for the company.
  Speaker 1
  Well, of course. I mean, that's the job of the entrepreneur is to see things the professionals would not see, or the professionals are making a more calculated decision on, is this good for my career Or not? Or if this succeeds, will it really help my career? But if it fails, will I end up getting fired? The entrepreneur is just going to – they're going to take a more of a let's try it. Let's see what happens. And if it works, we'll give more money to it. If it doesn't work, we'll discontinue it. I've never had a problem. It's always been pretty easy for me to try things, make mistakes, and admit that it's a mistake and discontinue it. It's like, we tried that. It didn't work. It's okay. Professionals sometimes have trouble letting go of that because they worry that this loss is going to be a blemish on their resume. An entrepreneur, I don't think, quite thinks that way.

- True Wealth Lies in Love, Not Power
  Summary:
  Corruption arises from the pursuit of money, fame, and power, which many believe will bring them love and satisfaction.
  However, these pursuits can lead to dissatisfaction and addiction, detracting from meaningful existence. The true fulfillment comes from creating and connecting with others rather than comparing one's achievements.
  An awareness of mortality fosters a desire to focus on love and impactful relationships rather than superficial markers of success.
  The realization that love is paramount often surfaces in moments of deep introspection or life-changing experiences, leading to personal acceptance and unconditional self-love.
  Ultimately, reflection on one’s life reveals that regrets center around relationships rather than material accomplishments.

  Speaker 2
  Throughout this, you had, I think, four coup attempts at your leadership at various stages. Talk to me about what that felt like and how you dealt with those.
  Speaker 1
  You know, I use a good metaphor, but it's only for the people that know something about The Lord of the Rings. Fortunately, the movies came out, but those books had a big influence on me when I was younger. I think I read those, the three books, five times before I got out of high school. It was kind of like my cult reading thing when I was a teenager. And then, of course, the movies came out. I've seen them multiple times. And in The Lord of the Rings, there's this one ring. The Amazon now has the rings of power show on, and they're showing how these rings were made, which is not actually in The Lord of the Rings. So it's really, really interesting stuff. And the one ring, the ring of power, it's a great metaphor. Because there are three things that I found are very corrupting for most people. Not everyone, but most people could be corrupted by money, fame, and power. Because what people want is love, and they think those things will give them love if they have enough of them. If you enough money or power or fame but in fact those things do not satisfy the soul and most people can easily be corrupted and addicted by those things if you have money you you start To compare yourself to people that have more money than you and you're dissatisfied. If you have fame, you have certain Instagram followers, or you see who has more and you want more. It doesn't really lead to happiness if you get more. And power, you see this with politicians, they want more power. And these things, again, do not satisfy the soul. So these are rings. The ring of power is corrupting. Well, in this case, I'm the CEO. I'm getting the most money or the most fame and the most power. And other people's coveted those things. And they always felt like they could do a better job. The coup attempts were always, I think, well-intended, or people doing them thought they were well-intended. They thought they really would do a better job than me. And if I could just get out of the way, then they would be able to wear the ring. And I wasn't going to just get out of the way, so they did what they could to get me out of the way. I think that's where the coups came from.
  Speaker 2
  And I just think partly human nature. As you acquired more wealth and power and fame as you guys grew, how did you stay so grounded?
  Speaker 1
  Well, of course, other people might tell you that they didn't think I stayed that grounded. But I think I did stay pretty grounded. And I think it's because I have this whole background in philosophy. And my book is just kind of about my own spiritual journey. And I got really clear at a pretty young age, like back in my existential days, back when I was in my late 20s, and then the psychedelics took it to another level. I got really clear about death. What I mean about that is that we're all going to die. I got that at a varying age. And most people, they're always in denial. There's this big denial of death that when you're young, it's like, well, that's what old people do, but I'm not old. And then I got my whole life ahead of me, and they just put it out of their mind. I was just aware that I only had so much time. So my big question is, what do I want to do with the time that I have? And so I always had this awareness that time was running out and that I needed to get on with stuff. And so the successes I had, it's like I once heard that somebody asked Picasso what his favorite painting was, and he said, the one I'm working on right now. And so I don't think that stuff corrupted me because I didn't care about it. To me, it was creating the next thing. It was the next thing I was doing that was fulfilling me. I didn't think money or fame or power would really be very satisfying. And they weren't. It was, it was, well, not the second time I met him because I'd met him at this conference and we'd hit it off. But when we were going up there to talk about maybe Amazon buying Whole Foods, you know, we were meeting at Jeff's boathouse, which was next to his mansion on Lake Washington. And, and, but when we, they wouldn't tell us who the meeting place was until we landed. And then they gave us an address. When we got there, we were searched. Our car was searched because they were worried about somebody trying to kill Jeff. And I was thinking to myself, I would never want to be so rich and so famous and so powerful that I couldn't live a normal life, that I didn't have any anonymity. That was like a real wake-up call. It's like, I'm sure Jeff's one of the most envied people in the world, but I would not want to have to live my life like that. So a little bit of fame, a little bit of money, a little bit of power to a certain point is gratifying to the soul. But past that point, you get diminishing returns. It's no longer bringing you any kind of happiness. It's now a burden. So I got clear about death at a pretty young age and I just wanted to accomplish things. And I didn't think my accomplishments were that big a deal. Other people are accomplishing stuff as well. So I didn't spend a lot of time comparing myself to others, either people that had less or had more. I was too busy creating the next painting because that was what was fun. That was what was exciting. That was where the joy and the love came. And then the relationships with the people that you're doing it with. That's the real satisfying part.
  Speaker 2
  When did you realize that love was the center of everything?
  Speaker 1
  I think I've had glimpses of it many times. I mean, I talked about it the first time I had that ego death and LSD, that I had this realization that we were all, it was just the one being. It was all founded ultimately on play and love and games. And then when I did MDMA for the first time, Adam, MDMA, Ecstasy, Molly, when it was legal back in 1984, that just burst my heart open. And I wrote it down. I was like, never forget this. There is nothing more important than love. And of course, you will forget it. But once you have that deep connection to it, you never quite forget it. And then my spiritual path took me, you know, studying the Course in Miracles, doing breath work, doing meditation. I wanted to go deeper into love. And so that's just sort of been a life, part ([Time 0:54:54](https://share.snipd.com/snip/04b3e1c4-b8f0-4128-a469-8b5adfd59fd4))
    - **Note:** Love and how to live life. Live without regrets. Love is the only meaning of life.
