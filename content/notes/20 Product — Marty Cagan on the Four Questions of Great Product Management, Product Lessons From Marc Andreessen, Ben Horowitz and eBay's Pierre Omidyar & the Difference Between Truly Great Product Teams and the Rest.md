### Highlights

- A Successful Product Needs To Be Valuable, Usable, Feasible, and Viable
  Key takeaways:
  - If a product is not valuable, it will not be successful.
  - It is important to have a product that is valuable to the market, and to be able to identify the needs of the market.

  Speaker 1
  So we had this discussion he showed me stuff. And literally, they had not changed their MVP in a significant way in three years. He figured, I know this is a great idea. There must be a market somewhere. They were trying different pricing strategies. They were trying different like premium strategies. And I'm like, look, dude, the problem is you don't have a product. Your product is not valuable. That's the issue. They had basically been dancing around every other risk and not tackling this head on, which is unless the product is right, you've got nothing. It's worth double clicking on one part of that, which is when we talk about getting the product right, there's really two sides to that. The first side is, does anybody have this problem? Does anybody need this thing? It turns out though, that's the easy one. People spend all this time on that one again, because it's easier, but they spend all this time. That's not hard. Honestly, we have very good tools. Most of the time, there's no doubt. All you have to do is look at the competitive marketplace and see how much money people are paying for solutions in that space. Most of the time, it's not rocket science. But if it is a little different, we have very good tools to test demand. The issue is rarely demand. The issue normally is the solution that you've come up with is not significantly better than the alternatives that are out there. And if it's not significantly better than the alternatives, people won't switch to your product. And then none of the other risks, none of the other cool marketing strategies, none of the other cool sales models, none of the other cool monetization, none of these things matter, because people don't really want your solution.
  Speaker 2
  You have to speak to customers and you have to put yourself in front of them.
  Speaker 1
  When you know that product discovery process, what are the critical questions that we need to answer in determining whether our solution is right with the customer? I do not know how to do product without intense immersion with customers. Everybody says that today, but usually when I describe what that really means, they're going, Oh, wow, I need a lot more time for that to your question. And this that you'll see why you need to go to customers in product discovery. There's really four questions that we always have to consider. Now, sometimes it's easy. Any one of these questions might be easy. Some are hard. You never know. But we always have these four questions. The first one, is it valuable? In other words, will people buy it? Or if they've already bought it? Or if it's a free service, will they choose to use it? That's the value question. Usually that's the hardest one. Second, assuming they want to use this, because it does something that they need or they want, can they figure out how to use it? That's the usability question. There's very rarely an excuse to do bad on that one, unless you just don't realize you need product designers. So normally, if you have the right skills in the startup, that one we can address if you just do the basics. The third is it feasible. Now, this can be a very big one, especially with things like machine learning technologies. Feasibility means, do we know how to actually build this solution? Do we have the skills on the team to build this solution? Do we have the technology stack available in order to build this solution? Do we have enough time? All that is feasibility. And the fourth risk is, can this sustain a business? This is viability risk. In other words, is it legal to actually do this? Can we afford to pay for it? Can we actually get this to market? Do we have the marketing mechanisms, the sales mechanisms? Do we have the channel setup so that we can effectively get this to market? These are all viability questions. A product to succeed needs to be valuable, usable, feasible and viable. Any one of those, of course, can kill a product if they're not. On the valuable side, I think the biggest problem that founders often may say is they're building features, not products. I see this a lot in people management solutions. And it really puts into question whether it's valuable or enough.
  Speaker 2
  Are you going to switch off something for another feature? I constantly question my own definition of features versus product. What is the difference between a feature versus a product? And how should I think about it?
  Speaker 1
  At one level, it's very superficial, the difference between a feature and project. And a lot of times, we'll just have a definition around the level of effort. So that's not really helpful. The way I try to get people to think about it, it's the difference between output and outcomes. So the difference is, features are just output. We can crank out features faster than we've ever been able to crank out features. If you notice though, the percentage of companies or products that do better is not really going up. So it's not about cranking out features. We call those feature factories. It just, that's all they do is optimize for features. What it's really about is solving problems for customers and for your company. And that's what we mean by outcomes. So when we talk about a product, we mean solving problems for real people. And again, could be meeting a need like in the entertainment space or the gaming space.
  Speaker 2
  But you're doing something valuable as opposed to just a bunch of features. When we look at those four, you could butcher the process or not do a good process through many different ways. What makes a really great execution of product discovery versus average?
  Speaker 1
  Usually the clock is ticking. There's a certain amount of runway there that it is true that some companies have had much longer runways in the last few years than I'm used to. And I don't necessarily think that's a good thing because people did a lot of really dumb things because they had so much pushing off the getting to product market fit because they could buy customers who things like that. But the clock is ticking for a startup. So the difference between a good company, a bad company, you don't really need to use product discovery techniques. If you have essentially unlimited time and money, you could do we used to call this the old Microsoft model. And to their credit, they would pull it off. You just assume you're going to spend three, four, five major iterations. And you're taking about a year for each iteration. So that's why it was normal for Microsoft. And their first couple years were terrible versions of the product. But by the third year, fourth year, it was starting to get pretty good. Most of us do not have monopoly profits to fund that stuff. We have to be smarter. And that's really the difference between good discovery. Because we even what Microsoft did, that's product discovery. It's just very slow, very inefficient. But that's what it is. You're trying out an idea. You're seeing if it's valuable, usable, feasible, viable. If it's not, you take another shot at it. In teams that really have constrained resources, by the way, this is not just startups, because even at a big company, it's not like they're running out of money, but they do run out of management patients. We like startups. And I tell them, look, here's the reality. You will probably need to do between 50 and 100 attempts before you get to product ([Time 0:12:25](https://share.snipd.com/snip/398587cc-f3e1-40a0-bd8e-75751761ef82))
