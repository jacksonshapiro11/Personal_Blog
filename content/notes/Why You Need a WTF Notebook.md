- Summary: The "WTF Notebook" technique involves keeping a journal where you note down things that seem odd or problematic in a new team without immediately addressing them. By observing, listening, and compiling a list of issues, you gain insights and avoid being perceived as overly critical. The process involves identifying simple solutions, discussing unresolved issues with the team, and gradually addressing more complex problems with empathy and collaboration. This method helps in establishing credibility, building a reputation as a problem solver, and effectively making positive changes within a team.

### Highlights

- here's a very specific reputation I want to have on a team: "Nat helps **me** solve *my* problems. Nat get things *I care about* done." That's the reputation that's going to get me the results I want in next year's performance review. That's the reputation that's going to get me a referral a few years from now.
  Before I started keeping this kind of list, I brought up problem I saw immediately, as soon as I noticed it. The reputation I got was, "Nat's always complaining about things. Nat thinks we're never doing things right." People stopped listening to me. I was personally frustrated, and professionally ineffective.

    - **Note:** This person keeps a wtf journal where everything that is weird or wrong they write down and then take stock cross some things out that got solved or are trivial then brings it to a boss or person in power or up and a meeting instead of always doing it and being seen as a complainer they are looked at as a well reasoned person. Cultivate high signal feedback over time.
