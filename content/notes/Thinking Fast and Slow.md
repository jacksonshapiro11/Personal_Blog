### Highlights

- The goals we set for ourselves have a great impact on our life and satisfaction. These goals influence our wellbeing on a day to day basis so our mood is defined by our goals and how it fits into our experience. People who set goals or have priorities are more likely to optimize for those priorities in life and their happiness is guided by how well they achieve these goals. Well being of both selves must be very included. People usually use a proxy for happiness ie substitute it. Focusing illusion nothing is more important to you then at the moment you’re thinking about it. Focusing illusion is a replacement/ what you see is all there is effect Mood of paraplegics lottery winners and newly weds is higher closer to the event but eventually wanes into insignificance over time unless the person is reminded of the good or bad event 1 month after the feeling is strong and fresh but one year it’s not a huge determinant on happiness. People’s experienced wellbeing is the same in these cases but they would be willing to trade significant things like years off their life to achieve life without the disability
- Doing things you enjoy with people you like makes you happier. First measure of happiness is health 2nd is contact with friends and family. The well-being people have when they experience their life and the judgement they have when they evaluate their life. Peoples evaluation of their lives and actual experiences while they should be the same in reality are different. People who anchor to money are less likely to appreciate the smaller things in life. Life satisfaction != experienced well being. You can buy more pleasurable experiences but lose some ability to enjoy the simpler things

    - **Note:** Invest in health and relationships as this drives happiness find joy in the little things and don’t be motivated by money. Time is what life is made of. Meaning of life is simple.
- We reject the experiencing self for the remembering self. We often don’t value something we can’t remember. Kinda like severance. Remembering vs experiencing self one gets valued another doesn’t. The duration of a life in stories doesn’t matter as much as how happy it was and if something unfortunate happens after death this is viewed negatively/with pity when in reality the dead person doesn’t care
    - **Tags:** #first-impressions, #experiencings-vs-remembering-self, #last-impression, #psychological-biases
    - **Note:** We have an experiencing and remembering self. One lives the experience but one remembers it and this is like the water experiment where when it ends well people report higher satisfaction even if objectively worse.
- There is the experience very and remembering self. One happens on the moment while the other recounted the experience people will generally optimize for the remembering self rather than the experiencing one. People who experience a very cold tub for 60 seconds view that as less favorable to experiencing the same 60 seconds of pain from the same cold with an additional 30 seconds where slightly warmer water enters to tub so while it’s longer and still painful the improvements at the end outweigh the fact that you could have just taken it out 30 seconds earlier and people prefer #2 even though it’s objectively worse in every way. This is the remembering self saying well the end was good and that’s the taste left in their mouth. People value a reduction of 6 to 4 more than 18 to 16 but they’re the same change so should be valued similarly. Tastes and decisions are shaped by memories which could be wrong. Humans assume we know how to maximize our happiness but this is obviously wrong

    - **Note:** The remembering self and intensity of changes vs relative changes. We value our final opinion rather than what we experience in the moment this leads to irrationality.
- Frames work to cause different decisions in the same situation. Framing things in terms of lives lost vs lives saved leads to a different decision people would rather guatenteee. Likewise people get more organ donations difference if 90–100% whether they have an opt in or opt out system. Similar countries have massive differences and this opt in or out is the only difference how your ask them question can be more important than the question
    - **Tags:** #default-decision, #framing-an-argument, #ask-the-right-question, #anchoring, #psychology, #psychological-biases, #writing-topics
    - **Note:** Framing the problem correctly can have a massive effect on the outcome. How you present something like an opt in or opt out system or where you anchor someone to will drive the interaction.
- Peoples system one reacts more in an absolute scenario but when asked to compare things system 2 kicks in and the answer is usually more pragmatic We have different values in single vs joint evals. We struggle to intensity matching things of different groups. When we view things in absolutes vs comparisons we get different areas of our Braun and different answers A dictionary with 2x as many entries but a ripped cover gets a lower bid in sundae evaluations but a high bid in joint evals
    - **Tags:** #comparision-vs-absolute, #psychological-biases, #system-1-vs-system-2, #base-rates
    - **Note:** We struggle to value collections and will undervalue something based on non sequiturs. Adding items of lower quality can hurt the price of a collection and you must be able to get back to the base rates to overcome this bias.
- We need to ignore sunk costs and mental accounts or were subject to losses.
- Mental accounting we view things differently based on a reference point. If we are given a ticket to a game and the weathers bad we’re less likely to go then had we bought that ticket likewise if we buy it and lose it we’re less likely to buy another one than we were to sell it. People who stray from the default and fail are much more likely to regret things than the opposite of people who do the accepted thing and fail

    - **Note:** Mental accounting. This blinds us from the Ev of our decisions. we need to view the world objectively as a dynamic system not based on past decisions. Forget sunk costs and make the best decision not the most defensible or ass covering but own it and take charge. Don’t fail conceptually pursue success.
      Mental accounting and failing conventionally
- People are risk averse in gains and risk seeking in losses Narrow framing is seeing each event as a one off while broad framing you can see closer to the true ev. If your need to play a game once and are loss averse 2-1 then yiu might not take a 1.5 ev but if you can play the game 1000 times your chances of loss are very small and your outcome will trend closer to the expected value Broad view of outcomes instead of narrow is the outside view and usually closer to optimal

    - **Note:** Risk averse to gains risk seeking in losses you accept lower ev to avoid a loss than make a gain. View events in the broad scope instead of narrowly. Play all positive EV games over time they converge take the long view not the narrow view.
- People overweight the likelihood of unlikely events and overweight the decision outcome of them. We view things that are tangible as most likely than intangible or harder to imagine events. People weigh 1274 out of 10000 people as a more likely event than something that happens 24.2% of the time because you can see the outcomes more clear with people likewise people overweight the % chance a team will win the finals when asked if each of 8 teams would win the total probability was over 200% because they only envisioned each team winning which they saw as more likely instead of weighing the chance of each team vs the field

    - **Note:** People overweight probabilities and see things as more tangible than they actually are. When you make something seem more tangible people think it's more likely.
      We craft each story independently and each we buy into seeming more likely than it I’d the man combined it becomes really backwards.
      Envisioning something makes it seem more real
- We value certainty more than the requisite gain in probability 95-100% more valuable than 90-95% certain gain and 0-5% more valuable than 5-10% certain loss avoided at 0% Certainty effect abs possibility effect skew our preferences People pay for certainty but avoid certainty in losses would rather pay more for a lottery ticket than it’s worth to have the chance of winning then they would be willing to sell it for because the small possibly of a big loss is why people buy insurance
    - **Tags:** #psychology, #psychological-biases, #definitions, #certainty-vs-lottery, #kahnamen, #value-certainty-in-upside-vs-risk-in-downsides
    - **Note:** People pay for certainty in the upside and like Asymmetric bets but avoid certainty in the downside which is kinda the same thing because you’re taking a small bet you lose nothing instead of definitely losing 100 vs a small chance you win 100 or lose almost nothing so the delta is the same.
- Acceptable conduct vs doing what’s fair. People view lowering someone’s salary as very unfair but if the person left and they hired someone new at a lower wage people viewed that as fair people are entitled to a reference point specific to them that others are not entitled to. Altruistic punishments were seen very positively by other people such that they felt pleasure. Social media mob cancel culture. People break norms and are punished and these people feel like they’re doing a deep moral good
    - **Tags:** #cancel-culture, #heuristic-(psychology), #anchoring, #relativity, #social-media, #morals-are-relative-and-change-with-the-times, #morality, #morality-to-justify-evil, #altruism, #psychological-biases
    - **Note:** People anchor to reference points both specific to them like salary and accepted in society like cancel culture. We live in a relative world and social media and cancel culture is seen as altruism because they are doing a moral good despite being bad
- Endowment effect people aren’t willing to buy or sell a bottle of wine for the same price. They’ll usually pay less to but it than will sell it for because they need to be compensated more for the loss of the bottle than have to give up to feel happy about gaining the bottle. Loss or gain emotional state is also a consideration in the transaction in addition to price. Losses lose larger than gains. The loss aversion is precedent when goods are held for use rather than exchange. If you’ve had $5 in your wallet you don’t really care about selling it for 5 singles but the diamond ring in your family is worth we’ll above them market price sentimental value People were given coins that could be exchanged for money followed standard economic theory but those given a gift like the university mug wanted more in return than its market value because it was worth more to them sentimental value Traders think differently about things and are much quicker to part with something near market value. Experienced traders don’t exhibit this effect
    - **Tags:** #endowment-effect, #loss-aversion, #anchoring, #definitions
    - **Note:** Endowment effect is intensity matching near and anchor point combined with loss aversion. You value having something more than you value losing it. You like something because you own it which adds value over the cost anyone else would pay.
- 3 important parts of prospect theory 1. Reference point - I risk value which we anchor to 2. Sensitivity to change - changes closer to our value have a steeper slope than ones further away 3. Loss aversion - we value losses greater than gains We see losses as between 1.5-2.5x worse than gains this changes of the money is life changing or leaves us with a risk of ruin then all bets are off Prospect theory don’t allow for regret and disappointment if you have a 50% chance of winning 1mm and a 50% chance of losing 1mm you experience that differently than if those numbers were 10 respectively

    - **Note:** Prospect theory anchor point that we are very sensitive to and skewed to the downside in sensitivity. If we want to sell a house for 1mm we'd be much more unhappy to get 900k then 1.1mm. we'd be much less sad for the difference of selling for 400k vs 500k ie desire for those is closer than 1mm to 900k. likewise we are less excited for the 100k increment betweeen 2.1 and 2.2mm vs 1mm and 1.1mm
      When the money becomes life changing all bets are off.
- Theory induced blindness once yiu accept a theory your judgements are biased by that theory Expected utility is based on absolute outcomes and recent trends. Also we prefer sure gains but will gamble rather than take a sure loss. We live based on reference points things above the reference points are gains while things below it are losses we feel losses more than love gains

    - **Note:** Bias inherent in models anchoring loss aversion and prospect theory.
- Optimists are generally happier and more productive. Optimists hot home runs because they are delusional but this also exposes their downside. Optimists are more likely to be visionary and successful people but they overrate their chances of success and skill and in a bad situation don’t quit while they’re ahead and lose a lot of money Optimism is good but it can also be destructive pre mortems and base rates are a good way to avoid and get ahead of errors

    - **Note:** Optimists is a good approach but it's domain dependent. You don't want to be an optimist as a debt investor but as a start up founder to need to be. Skew active optimistic and use base rates to avoid becoming a delusional optimist is necessary to do great things. You need to be a bit crazy to shape your world.
- 1. The inside view vs the outside view. How the people in the group think it will go and how other groups performed in the same task. The group thought it would take 2 years based on their skills and intuitions but similarly skilled teams generally took 7-10 years with a 40% of failure the inside view misses all the unforeseen circumstances of the outside view 2 planning fallacy people assume the best case not the ev or realistic case 3. Perseverance knowing this project could take 7-10 years and even though no one wanted to commit that there was enough cognitive dissonance to believe it was different this time The inside view prevents you from seeing the unknown unknowns that throw a wrench in plans people only see what is in front of them and extrapolate even if what has been done so far isn’t indicative of the future of the project If the data is reliable the outside view is the base rate and the inside view is the intuition about the specific situation. Find a good reference class for the problem find useful statistics in that reference class then use specifics of the case to adjust from there The planning fallacy leads to over optimistic guesses that do not weigh the risks properly because hey understate and don’t fully understand the risks

    - **Note:** Inside versus outside view. Rely on base rates don’t be swayed by thinking you’re different. You’re more average and exposed to unknown unknowns than you think. Use base rates ignore cognitive dissonance. Inside view is why you think the base rates are wrong and the outside view is the base rates and you need to adjust them to fit reality.
      Start with base rates then adjust slightly due to the inside view
      Rely on base rates adjust slightly for inside view we’re over optimistic and irrational but maybe we have to be. We are more average than we think.
      Start with outside view/ base rates and adjust slightly for inside view.
- Intuition is nothing more or nothing less than recognition 1. To acquire a skill an environment must be regular enough to be predictable 2. Have an opportunity to learn these regularities through practice I set these conditions you can develop skilled intuition Intuition is based on quality and speed of feedback and the ability to practice often. Expertise is an array of skills not just one skill so you need to develops wide array of skill. Medical doctors with long term diagnosis or investors because there is a huge gap between decision and outcome so the feedback is very delayed Short term intuition is more likely to be developed than long term prediction of the future Experts learning history and environment is much more important for developing intuition. Sometimes confidence can blind to the truth

    - **Note:** To acquire a skill you must have a good predictable learning environment that is legible with opportunities for practice. Intuition is formed with good quality and immediate feedback. Long term prediction has such a big gap that it’s unlikely to develop a skill with that
      False confidence is an issue expertise is an array of skills not just one.
- Intuitions and formulas combined are very useful but only when intuitions are guided by facts and thinking on the right wavelength. Simple formulas can equal or outweigh intuition

    - **Note:** simple heuristics can often mitigate bias that appears in intuition. Intuitions are better earned in clear learning environments
- Errors are inevitable the works is complex and you need to weight all the factors and make a probabilistic call

- For some of our most important beliefs we have no evidence at all except that people we know and trust hold the beliefs considering how little we know the confidence in our beliefs is preposterous and it is also essential

    - **Note:** We take social proof and don’t do the work because we can’t for everything so we should hold our beliefs lightly. Conviction and accuracy don't always correlate
- To think clearly about the future we need to clean up our thoughts on the past. We can’t know what going to happen only have some idea because the future is unknown so nothing can be known about it we have to do the best we can with what we have. We do have incredible hindsight bias in outcomes. Tough to know the unknowable and it’s more clear in hindsight. People think they thought something different in the past based on how the future turned out they change their past beliefs. Outcome bias makes it hard to understand beliefs when the decision was made. Hindsight is unkind with people who act for agents for others. The worse the outcome the greater the hindsight bias. We think we know more in the moment then we actually do. Tough to understand skill vs luck in a situation that is rare and a few lucky outcomes in big situations can lead to skill being overrated for that person
    - **Tags:** #luck-and-risk, #tail-risk, #histroical-knowledge, #hindsight-bias
    - **Note:** Hinsight bias drives our interactions and its hard to understand your mental state at the time of the event. Therefore we must be careful not to overweight our skill in tail events that can be attributed to luck.
- Prediction correlation between 2 measures is = shared factors among determinants. If correlation is 30% we can come up with a guess like this 1. Start with the average 2. Given the information use intensity matching to see the full effect. Match evidence to predictive variable 3. Estimate your evidence between the correlation between the 2 variables. Ie get the correlation between the 2 vars 4. If the correlation is .3 move 30% from step 2 to step 1 This helps you build on your intuitive prediction by lowering the bias when you make the prediction. Non regressive to the mean will be biased based on the evidence unless the correlation is 100% This is an approximation on statistical evidence but in some situations where tail events are really valuable and the data doesn’t follow a mean distribution we need to overweight our predictions and underweight regress to the mean because there is huge value in the in linear effects. Using regression the the mean hurts your ability to hit home runs but helps you hit singles and take walks. For vc intuition is more important than mean regression for making bank loans it’s the opposite. The value of this most is you get to measure and think about of how you know
    - **Tags:** #favorite, #regression-to-the-mean, #base-rates, #power-law, #prediction-vs-prophecy, #probabilitic-thinking, #intuition
    - **Note:** In every day life making normal predictions understanding base rates is vital like in making bank loans, but in power law systems you need to rely on intuition because you are making probabilistic predictions on an unknown problem space. This is a great breakdown of probabilistic prediction and overview of a field where prediction isn't as important
- Correlation and regression are 2 views on the same concept. When the correlation between 2 scores is imperfect there will be a regression to the mean. Things explained in one way in a causal story will be more attributable to regression to the mean than causal factors. Intelligent women tend to marry less intelligent men because the correlation between spouses isn’t perfect. These say the same thing but the causal story is more controversial than the statistically fact. Criticism usually is followed by improved performance and praise by reduced performance because of regression to the mean. Those who had done really well will likely not do as well and likewise those that had not done really well will do better die to mean reversion not any skill specific factor. Luck + skill = regression to the mean

    - **Note:** Regression to the mean vs skill. Regression to the mean is often a better and more true explanation than anything we do things that combine luck and skill and regression corrects for the luck variance. We try to explain simple stats.
- Causal base rates are easier to interpret than purely statistical ones because in causal base rate we have a story we tell ourselves to justify. Diffusion of responsibility in tense situations. To teach psychology you need to teach emotions people can’t learn statistics if you say these people do this 50% or the time they’ll be swayed by emotion but if you show them something they would not expect they understand human behavior in the situation better and guess more likely
    - **Tags:** #cause-and-effect-vs-mean-reversion, #base-rates, #psychological-biases
    - **Note:** Causal base rates and causation is easier to understand than statistics. We become swept up in emotions and miss the obvious
- 2 situations a flood that kills 1k people or an earth quake that causes a flood that kills 1k. 1 is obviously more likely but people thought scenario 2 was more plausible because it was more representative and easier to imagine. Less is more fitting into one bucket vs fitting into 2 buckets. 1 bucket will always be easier A set of high value baseball cards valued higher than a set of the same cards + a few worse ones when done independently when viewed together this mistake wasn’t made

    - **Note:** Less specific things are always more likely than more specific things but more specific ideas appear more vivid so we overweight then.
      This is the Charlie munger idea of assumptions investing pick the investment with fewer assumptions simplicity power of.
- Linda fits the descriptions of a feminist bank teller better than the descriptions of a bank teller so people think it’s more likely she’s a femamist bank teller but this is impossible because of all the bank tellers all feminists are included overweighting representatives vs base rates. System 2 failure people rate representativeness higher than what is logically possible. Rate femanist bank teller higher than bank teller even though this is impossible. 90% of people didn’t realize this even when asked if she’s more likely to be a bank teller or femanist bank teller a fallacy and cognitive dissonance
    - **Tags:** #system-1-vs-system-2, #psychological-biases, #cognitive-dissonance, #representative-heuristic, #base-rates, #overweight-what-we-visualize
    - **Note:** Cognitive dissonance when something makes more sense to you visually you overweight it but you need to consider base rates. Representative bias when we visualize we overweight.
- Tom w substitution of description over base rates. Even though we know there are more shy social scientists then computer scientists 10% of social scientists are shy while 50% of computer scientists are and if there are 10x more social scientists someone whose shy is more likely to be of that group than computer scientists but when we here the description we use association and representation instead of base rates so we overrate the % he will be a computer scientists becauseof representative bias. Question of probability is harder than similarity so the question gets replaced and the answer gets muddied and wrong. We neglect base rates because of representativeness
    - **Tags:** #base-rates
    - **Note:** Remember base rate probability.
- Affect heuristic people make decision based on their emotions. Substituting how to feel about something for what you think about something replacing thinking with feelings. The more you like something the better or less risky it is halo effect for ideas. We overrate the risk of horrible situations because they’re rare but more memorable than say heart disease. Availability cascades bad thing happens then news focuses on that and talks about it all the time then people see it more and expect it’s more likely than it is because gruesome images come to mind easier than a lot of very minor ones

    - **Note:** Affect heuristic replaces how you think about something with how you feel. Emotionally driven decisions substitution. Halo effect. 
      We overrate the tail risks because they scare us more and are more vivid. 
      Availability cascade you see something and then that creates a feedback loop where it’s always on your mind.
- Availability influences your opinion if you can think of things easier than you’re more likely to associate yourself with those things. If something comes easily to mind you overrate it’s likelihood. Availability biases are a function of system 1. The more media stories the more likely you think it is when it’s really unlikely overall
    - **Tags:** #base-rates, #availability-heuristic, #system-1-vs-system-2, #bias-(inherent-in-models), #stories-we-tell-ourselves
    - **Note:** availability skews base rates
- Anchoring. If you are started with a number like do you think ghandi was older your younger than 115 when he died than asked your best guess for his age it will likely be higher than if you ask if he was older or younger than 60 when he died we become anchored to the initial value. Anchoring occurs by system 2 adjustments to an initial value like bias over time that effects decisions and system 1 by priming effects Link between anchors and suggestion. You can measure the anchoring effect by using anchors and then seeing the difference between the guesses in reality. If you propose giving $20 vs $200 you can measure actual donations anchors can be more or less random and still effective. With things with little transparency or specific knowledge Anchor is very valuable
    - **Tags:** #base-rates, #anchoring, #negotiations, #psychological-biases, #priming, #specific-knowledge
    - **Note:** Anchoring is a way to frame a conversation that can influence the outcome. If you start at a reference point more favorable the deviation will mean less.
- Extreme outcomes are biased by small sample sizes. Cities with low instances of kidney cancer are rural small populations mostly Republican in the Midwest and south and cities with high instances of kidney cancer have the same characteristics more the law of small numbers than anything about the towns or people there. Of you did the sample the next year the towns might be different but their characteristics would be the same People use small sample sizes and create inaccurate results It’s easier to look for why something is true than to constantly maintain doubt

    - **Note:** Law of small numbers bias in small sample sizes and unlikely events. Because of these statistical features of the world we must always maintain doubt and our critical nature. Small samples lead to bias maintain critical nature. We want solutions when the answer is complexity, and there may be no answer or solution.
- Substituting questions if an answer isn’t readily available or hard system 1 will swap it for an easier question. Target question vs heuristic questions. If yiu can’t solve a hard problem replace it with an easier question. Target question how happy am I in life heuristic question what is my mood right now Target question how will the presidents approval rating look. Replacement question how do I feel about the president right now If you get primed with an easily substitutable question youre more likely to substitute it because what you see is all there is Students asked about happiness then how many dates they went on answered uncorrelated but students asked the questions in reverse showed very high correlation as they replaced the question Usually system 1 suggests and system 2 instead of being critical and analyzing works to justify the answer
    - **Tags:** #lazy-(humans-are-lazy), #system-1-vs-system-2, #heuristic-(psychology), #priming, #subsitution-(in-psychology), #target-vs-heuristic-question
    - **Note:** We substitute questions then system 1 answers them instead of system 2 having to think deeply about what’s being asked. How happy are you —> your current level of happiness
- Judgements happen through intensity matching system 1 isn’t great at sums but on an relative basis it’s very good. We can match a crime to a color because we understand the intensity. Mental shotgun intensity matching drawing conclusions that are roughly true but actually false
- Jumping to conclusions is good when cost for mistakes are low and bad when they are high. Jumping to conclusions can be very useful and important but it can also lead to a lot of hardship If someone is heading toward the bank you would think they’re getting money but if you learn they’re in a boat you realize something different system one gives the knee jerk answer based on the most likely outcome given all the information which is normally right but with more or different context can be very wrong. If you have the context of a boat in mind your answer may be different than if you had money on your mind Conscious doubt is system 2 not system 1 system 1 just accepts and is biased to believe Humans to understand something must believe first in the statement then work out what would need to be true about the world to believe Halo effect liking breeds liking Confirmation bias trying to confirm instead of search for truth. Limit bias things that happen early on bias the remaining entries To derive the best information make sure it’s independent and unbiased by other sources eliminate redundancy What you see is all their is you can’t conceptualize the unknown unknowns. Need to build on different eventualities jumping to conclusions on limited information is a huge source of bias and error. People who heard one sided evidence were more confident than those who heard both sides because they didn’t even conceptualists thru could be wrong. Peoples confidence is dependent on the stories we tell ourselves which is heavily influenced by how much we know if we only know half we can be very confident and wrong. Wusiati is also greatly effected by framing effects and base rates are ignored

- We have norms or mental models for things in our head and system 2 raises flags when something is outside the norm. The large mouse climbed over the small elephant you still think the elephant is much bigger than the mouse but this can also be a trick when what is expected is replaced by something similar or you experience an anomaly more frequently you raise the probability when that is not the case. We have norms and sometimes when things go against them we are surprised. We also view things in cause and effect lights even if there is no clear reason. Mental models we have

    - **Note:** We become alarmed when things deviate from our mental models.
- Cognitive ease the more something readily comes to memory or the easier it is to read the more likely people will think it’s true. Legibility and connections = legitimacy. People want to minimize effort and maximize signal so rhyming good font clear ideas are best to convey an idea. When we have cognitive strain we focus more though so we’re less gullible. Familiarity = favor ability. Simply seeing something more raises the chances of you finding it favorable Mood effects system one when we’re happy we perform better than when we’re tilted. When happy were less vigilant but more creative and intuitive when we’re unhappy we’re more skeptical and don’t react as well with small tasks Familiarity and repetition breeds liking or believing
- Priming when we hear the word chicken noodle and someone asks us to bake a hot beverage we’ll more likely say soup than if we primed with a different word. The mind is associative in its methods words link to other words in memory. Unconscious memory priming outside the scope of consciousness. Smiling makes you happier unconscious priming. Hacking system one at an unconscious level to perform or prefer certain behaviors.

    - **Note:** Planting ideas in peoples heads.
- Self control is system 2 requires attention and effort. Finite reservoir of attention and control and when you use it you need to reload it. Emotional or intense situations deplete self control like heading thinking or drinking ect. There is a difference between being worn out through emotional ways which you can replenish and being deleted in mental energy you can’t think harder than possible ie add 3 ask. Judges grant parole more after lunch than before. You’re not you when you’re hungry Bat and ball problem bat + ball costs $1.10 together and bat is $1 more how much is the ball. This requires a lot of cognitive effort to not say $1 even if it’s easy. Most people answer this wrong it shows were generally lazy and can be easily biased. Many people are overconfident and prone to place too much faith in their intuition System 1 is impulsive system 2 is lazy

    - **Note:** System 1 vs system 2 you only have a finite amount of focus and things you can keep in your head at once. You must understand this and be careful to not fool yourself know when the lights should go on in alarm to turn on system 2.
      There’s a difference between cognitive load, how much your brain can process and emotional load how you feel and how worn out you are emotionally, which also depends on how much you can process, but this can be replenished
- Mental life is conducted at a stroll and only rarely are we engaging system 2 in an effortfull jog or run. When we become super focused we also become blind to many things. You can be super focused on reading but not see the gorilla on the screen. Mental effort is also finite and runs out when you are using it more the less you see around you. You only have x amount of attention so even if you’re 100% focused you can’t have materially more attention than your max capable attention. The more skilled or talented you are at something the less attention you need to devote to it to perform at a similar level to someone with less of the two. System one can deal with simple integrations but system 2 deals with integrating complex topics Intelligence is the control of attention and efficiency in performing tasks. Time pressure adds to fast thinking and causes more effortful thinking We solve by easy steps and work by the law of least effort

    - **Note:** Humans are inherently lazy and will engage their system 1 effortlessly for easy tasks or hard tasks that have been mastered. Rarely are we engaging system 2 effortfully but when we do our focus can distract us from seeing the gorilla in the room.
- System 1 without effort intuitive reactionary driving a car on the open road knee jerk reactions. Saying your name when asked your name System 2 thoughtful measures hard to do real deep thinking. Counting all the vowels in a sentence. The gorilla video is a product of system 2 because without the intense focus in the task you wouldn’t miss the gorilla This interplay is an optimization of energy and attention using system 2 is costly and time consuming system 1 can often be right an quick which may be vital System 2 overcomes the impulses of system 1 Recognize situations where mistakes are likely and take steps to activate system 2 and be careful in those situations

- Question 1: Am I thinking fast or slow? 
  Question 2: Am I too stressed to think clearly? 
  Question 3: Is this a reversible decision? 
  Question 4: What would you think about this if it were someone else's decision?
  Question 5: What would I think about this a year from now?
  Question 6: What would I advise a friend to do in this situation?
  Question 7: What's the quality of the evidence?
  Question 8: What are the opposing arguments?
