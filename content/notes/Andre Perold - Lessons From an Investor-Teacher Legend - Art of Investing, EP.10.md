  If you're at the top of the institutional investing world, beating the S&P by 2 to 3% per year over long periods would put you right in the top decile of all active management.
  Speaker 1
  What would I have if instead of spending I had minus spending? So call that beating the S&P by 2%. Instead of 22 times, I have 40 times. So a good investor who can beat the S&P by 2 has doubled their wealth over 30 years, just 2%. So spending is crazily expensive to wealth. And investing better is crazily accretive. And little numbers, that's 2%. What's 2%? It's nothing. I get 2X. So the other point to be made is compounding is one of these things where you got to say it's a game of inches. It's very rare that it's you get an idea, you IPO with the next day, and you take home tons of money and then you just go and play golf. Okay, just not how it works. It's a grind.

    - **Note:** Compounding is a game of inches you can outperform 2% but likewise you can spend 2% less a year and compound that at the market rate and get the same outcomes so spending saving and investing. The hard part is cutting a little making the right rushed to be successful. It’s near impossible to beat the s&p but it’s possible to spend less. Suffer a little and lower your risks. Invest in your human capital this compounds make friends learn more stuff. Constantly improve your human capital
      Instead of investing better invest more. Long/short term time delta. Constantly learn and make relationships.
- Business school creates great connections benefits of great friends relationships and teachers. Finance is efficient and alpha is competed away quickly so you need to keep evolving and find unique differentiation to craft your edge to be successful. Must be non consensus here he’s looking at small caps to do that. You can either be a genius have great ideas or have niche intelligence where the bar to acquire is high the rewards are low and disrupting becomes uneconomic so you have an edge that can sustain. Great ideas all the time is tough to sustain. Need to get lucky. Surface inefficiencies. Find places where the smart money can’t play. Do things that build human capital over the long term.

    - **Note:** Build a network of good friends and colleagues. Finance is roughly efficient so you need to find the pockets of inefficiencies with high barriers to entry to create a durable competitive advantage. You need to be non consensus and right in a place too small for people to care niche genius or absolute genius at scale.
