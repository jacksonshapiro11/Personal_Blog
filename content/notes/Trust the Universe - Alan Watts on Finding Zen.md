### Highlights

- 10,000 Things One suchness and we're all one suchness and that means suchness comes and goes like everything else because this whole world is an on andof system as the Chinese say it's the Yang and the yin and therefore it consists of now you see it now you don't here you are here you aren't because that's the very nature of energy to be like waves
  and waves have crests and troughs only we being under a certain kind of sleepiness or Illusion imagine that the trough is going to overcome the wave or the crest the yin the dark principle is going to overcome the Yang or the light principle and that off is finally going to triumph over on and we shall I say bug
  ourselves by indulging in that illusion gee supposing Darkness did win out wouldn't that be terrible and so we're constantly trembling and thinking that it may because after all isn't it odd that anything exists it's most peculiar it requires effort it energy and it would be so much
  easier for there to have been nothing at all therefore we think well since being since the is side of things is so much effort you always give up after a while and you sink back into death but death is just the other face of energy and it's the rest the not being anything around that produces something around just in the same way that you can't have solid without space or space

  won't put a name on it you're that and you can't be anything else so you are relieved of fundamental Terror that doesn't mean that you're always going to be a great hero that you won't jump when you hear it bang that you won't worry occasionally that you won't lose your temper it means though that fundamentally deep deep down within
  you you will be able to be human so it is then that uh if I may put it metaphorically janga said the perfect man employs his mind as a mirror it grasps nothing it refuses nothing it receives but does not keep in other words this is to be put it very strictly into our modern idiom this is to live without hangup [Music]
  that is to say to be able to drift like a cloud and flow like water seeing that all life is a magnificent illusion a playing of energy and there is absolutely nothing fundamentally to be afraid of ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3tc1dwsm26bmvyj2z0kkx4v))
