  Speaker 2
  When you think about living a life to deserve what you want and what you should get, what does that mean to you?
  Speaker 1
  Well, for instance, my father was also a tremendous teacher in my life and really the first and foremost teacher that I had. And there was a situation that came up the other day where someone had sort of tricked me into doing a favor for them, sort of some backdoor moves and whatnot. I ended up doing a favor for them. And I was with a colleague at the time and we both sort of realized we've been hustled a little bit. And I said, you know, my dad used to tell me, anytime, anytime you can do a favor for somebody, do it. Just do it. Because life is long and you never know how those things come back over time. So I think the idea of just always trying to be helpful, always trying to add value, always trying to do favors for people, always just trying to make them glad they interacted with you. That's a pretty good central organizing principle. And if ([TimeÂ 0:04:11](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ce74a9f7-a810-4294-8306-d7b874c2a2c6))
    - **Note:** If you can ever do a favor for someone do it. Treat everyone well equally and win win. Create a product for society he gave his ideal boss a trade idea that paid 70% in a year well researched bond that fit their investment model got hired soon after. He got a cold investing streak and would go through his biggest investments and passes give his reasons sometimes your cold and sometimes youâ€™re unlucky. Important to understand mistakes and omissions. Risks of omission > comisssion. Be curious about the path youâ€™re not taking. Go positive go first. Process over outcome. Avoid stupidity size bets right go positive with a good process.

  Speaker 1
  Fortunately from 90 through 96 or something like that, the results were spectacular. And I established credibility by putting up very good numbers for the first five, six, seven years I was there. Now in the late 90s, that's when I would say the Internet 1.0 came along. And I struggled, I struggled massively, and I really had the biggest period of underperformance that I've ever had in my career. And that went on, I mean, it seemed like forever. Maybe it was two, two and a half years or something like that. I'm an accountant by training as those businesses were coming along. I struggled to understand how things that did not appear to be profitable could sell for such prices in the marketplace. And I resisted it in many ways. Now, my friend Josh Terasoff helped me a great deal in helping to see the cash flows that were there separate and distinct from the way gap accounting would present them. And I managed to round that corner and pivot in an appropriate way. But 98, 99, they were miserable years. And I can remember a couple of things that I think are worth noting and this may make it to the podcast and may end up on the cutting room floor. I get it. But two things. One, a leadership story. So Steve's office was next to mine. And we would talk every day, all day, every day. And every month we would have a formal meeting where I would print out the portfolio. And typically the pattern was, you know, triage among the top five or ten holdings which accounted for 50% of the value of the portfolio. And we would talk about those businesses, fundamentals, sales, revenues, earnings, management changes, new products, things that would seem relative to the fundamental aspects Of the profitability of the business. Well, in that period where I was so grossly underperforming, in addition to talking about the top holdings that we owned, I would talk about the top things that were in the news that were Going up the most that we didn't own. And we would talk about the same sorts of aspects, the business, the sales, the revenues, the management, the products, things of that nature. And fortunately for 18, 24 months, every month at the end of that meeting, Steve would conclude by saying, I understand what you are doing and why you're doing it. And I understand what you are not doing and why you are not doing it. See you next month. There are times when, as my friend Chad Rowe would say, in the investment business, and I think this is true business and life in general, that you either look way smarter than you really Are or way dumber than you really are. So I think one of my skills as a manager is I developed deep relationships with people and I ascertain that these are good people and they are pretty good at what they do, but they can go Through periods of time where it doesn't look that way.

  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  A week that decision saved us, I don't know, hundreds of millions of dollars. And it put us in a good financial position to work the process of turning around Terranova, which was a trouble-com name. We knew that. But fortunately, we made a very good, instantaneous decision, which had some skill and some luck about it. I don't claim prescience. I just claimed that I knew I didn't want to own those things that they owned. And normally, I tend to be incremental and take step by step by step. But every once in a while, I am capable of dramatic action as well. Once again, gets back to the to the Munger thoughts that are drifting through us right now. And he talks about sort of in 60, 70 years of investing. There were half a dozen times in his life that he felt very compelled about a certain thing and took a huge swing at it. And that made all the difference. So that was one of his skills and one of the things he was able to do several times during the course of his career. I don't do that very often. But that was one time when I did and it worked out.
  Speaker 2
  That's an incredible story. And the timing there is so apt. And then you also had a lot of cash for the... That is correct.
  Speaker 1
  Which put me back in the good graces of Steve and the rest of the Mark Elborn. Because getting through that period of time proved itself to be the right way to go. And that actually connects to... It was 07. So I was invited and asked to consider going to the board of the Washington Post coming at that time. And Don Graham, the chairman of the post, reached out to me and we chatted and he had understood through my friend Chris Davis who was on the board. ([TimeÂ 0:35:45](https://share.snipd.com/snip/98cdbc23-e9b5-4346-9394-d70a5f93c621))
    - **Note:** Take a few big concentrated bets when you really believe otherwise stick with process. Hit fat pitches. Acting the right way compounds over a long time horizon creates a most. In bad times take a deep breath slow it down follow your process. Limit leverage to stay alive but leverage is vital. Some people need to live in the right now you need to understand what short/ long term trade off is if youâ€™re about to die from starvation youâ€™d pay more for food than after a meal. Short term optimal is rarely long term optimal but how do we look stupid in the moment by playing long term games in a short term world. Delay gratification is vital. Tough to be in a bad position and think long term. Anyone is a bad position makes a worse decision than a dumber person in a much better position good position all options are good bad position all options are bad how do you engineer good positions
- The Temptation of Making Bigger Numbers and Minimizing Risk
  Key takeaways:
  - Looking at the bigger numbers and minimizing the risk may be tempting, but it's important to consider making different decisions with the end in mind.
  - Being successful in the long term may require looking like an idiot in the short term.
  - Being financially, emotionally, and psychologically prepared to withstand criticism and unconventional actions is crucial for long-term success.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  But it is so tempting to be at the moment where you're making bigger and bigger numbers and you're minimizing the risk of zeroing out because that's not what's happening right now. What is happening right now is you're making that number super big and that's super fun. Who wouldn't want to do that? Well, the person who wouldn't want to do that is that person who's at the party and instead of completely falling into the joy of the party is looking at their watch and thinking, you know, We might want to make a different decision right now. And again, Munger's discipline of thinking backwards, inverting, always inverting, always working with the end in mind. That's just a fundamental component of the way I'm wired.
  Speaker 2
  I think one of the hardest aspects of that is in order to do that, you almost have to look like an idiot in the short term to be successful in the long term. And that becomes hard and three aspects immediately come to mind. Financially, you have to be willing or able to withstand that emotionally psychologically. You have to be willing to withstand doing something that not everybody else is doing and have them maybe point at you and laugh at you. And environmentally, you have to be in a situation where you have stability and it's not going to jeopardize that. That's exactly right. ([TimeÂ 1:04:34](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3de68fd0-fed3-43db-aefc-aee8f11884f2))
    - **Note:** Donâ€™t over optimize you donâ€™t need to hit the pico top but this can lead to stupidity in the short term. Perfect is the enemy of good and you could blow up to squeeze the last little bit which is a terrible risk return trade off. You need to be ok with being wrong ok to feel stupid.
- Managing Equity Exposure and Second Guessing Decisions
  Key takeaways:
  - Equity exposure was reduced in response to insurance business events, but the timing was suboptimal.
  - Certain sold assets were regretted later, but the balance sheet was strengthened.
  - Making tough decisions in real-time based on available information is crucial.
  - Comparing current knowledge to past circumstances can lead to flawed judgments.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I reduced some of our equity exposure as a consequence of what I saw taking place under insurance business at that particular time. In retrospect, that was not optimally timed. And there were some things that I wish I hadn't sold as we go, continue to go down the road. But at the same time, I did fortify our balance sheet and operated from a position of safety. So it wasn't fun, but it was the right thing to do and confronted with the same facts and circumstances in real time. Again, I would do the exact same thing. And if you want to see a movie that would sort of illustrate, and I'm not claiming this amount of glory or involvement, but that Tom Aks movie, Sully, where the pilot lands the plane in The LaGuardia. And he was second guest in the hearings is why didn't you go to Tito, bro? Well, the decisions he had to make in real time with no possibility of turning back, they were outstanding. They were unbelievable. They could always be second guest, but you really shouldn't do that. So it just was a period that was no fun.
  Speaker 2
  I hope you don't second guess yourself. I mean, if we go back to what we knew at the time, right, like it's so important that we don't apply today's knowledge to what we knew at that time. ([TimeÂ 1:14:38](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3dcf6c38-b0cb-40f0-a2a8-2341a7895904))
    - **Note:** You canâ€™t apply todays knowledge to another time. Need to cultivate trusts from institutions. Risk is more things can happen then do happen. Centralizing creates fragility. Create ownership and paid over years not within a year long term incentives. You canâ€™t make a good deal with bad person make mistakes and size them well. Limit complexity understand opportunity costs and unknown unknowns. Accounting standards getting crazy and curropt like derivatives accounting. Itâ€™s hard to continue to do what works because it seems so simple but thatâ€™s where success is when you sell youâ€™re not selling 100% but maybe only 70-80% vs taxes is the investment that much better. You need to be patient we want to achieve the outcome we want but we want it faster.
