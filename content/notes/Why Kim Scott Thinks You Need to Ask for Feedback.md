  If you're in a position of power and you get good at radical candor, all of a sudden you have such clear benefits for all the people under you because they're getting such clear feedback from you. But what about if you're the it's the other way and you are an employee and you want more clear feedback, you want to be better at this. But the people who are giving you feedback aren't really good. What can you do in that situation where it's kind of like, you can change yourself, but it's hard to get it from the other end.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, soliciting feedback, I think, is really important no matter what role you play. But especially if you're if you're the manager, because if you're the manager, you've got to lay that power down. And one of the best ways to lay your power down is to solicit feedback. So here are four steps for soliciting feedback. The first step is to think about the words you're going to use to ask for feedback. Because if you say, do you have any feedback from me, you're wasting your breath. I can already tell you the answer. Oh, no, everything's fine. So you want to think about how you're going to ask. The way that I like to ask is, what could I do or stop doing that would make it easier to work with me. But don't ask my question. Because if you sound like Kim Scott and not like yourself, the other person is not going to believe that you really want the answer. So you got to figure out how you're going to ask in your own words. Another tip on the go to question, by the way, is to make sure it can't be answered with a yes or a no. You want to say, what could I do? Not is there anything I could do? So step number one, good question. Step number two, embrace the discomfort. No matter how good your question is, the other person is still going to feel uncomfortable. And the only way out of that discomfort is through. Best thing I need to do, close your mouth count to six. I only made it to three just there. And I can tell you're getting it so long.
  Speaker 2
  It's so painful every time. Oh my God, it's so hard.
  Speaker 1
  So almost no one can endure six full seconds of silence. So they'll probably tell you something, which brings you to step number three. You want to make sure that you're listening with the intent to understand not to respond. Simplest way to do that is to ask some follow up questions. And then the fourth thing you've got to do is you got to reward the candor. And that's pretty easy if you agree with the feedback. You fix the problem and you ask the person, you know, did I overcorrect and I undercorrect? And by the way, a good tip that one of my managers once gave me is she said, if you get some feedback, for example, the feedback to me was that I was moving too fast. She said, you will not have fixed this problem until people start telling you that you're moving too slow. So you actually need to kind of aim to overcorrect. And then maybe you'll get it right. But there's going to be another thing that'll happen. And that is that you will disagree with the feedback that you just solicited. And now you feel wedged. I think the thing to do when you disagree with feedback that you solicited or when you disagree with unsolicited feedback is first to demonstrate that you're not shut down the feedback. So look for the 5 or 10% of what the other person said that you can agree with and give voice to that. Because you rarely disagree with 100% of what someone said. And that kind of makes you listening. Tangible, it shows you're paying attention. And then say, as for the rest of it, let me think about it and then get back to you and then get back to them and have a respectful disagreement. I mean, you can't argue endlessly. At some point, you've got to listen, challenge, commit. But having that respectful disagreement is what's going to save your relationship.

    - **Note:** Ask for feedback specifically sit in the discomfort of their thinking ahead of the answer. To implement it you may need to overcorrect. Make sure you show you’re paying attention and bouncing ideas and digesting the feedback.
