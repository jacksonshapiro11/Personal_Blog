### Highlights

- Another lesson of my M.I.T. years was the fundamental separation between busyness and productivity. Scientists who work in labs, and have to run experiments or crunch numbers, can famously work long hours. Theoreticians can’t, as there’s only so much time you can usefully think about math. Right before a paper deadline, you might push hard to get results written up. On the other hand, weeks could go by with little more than the occasional brainstorming session. An average day might require two or three hours of hard cogitation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsrd8x72rhqnw2t6ge1hqfgw))

    - **Note:** busyness vs productivity speed vs velocity sometimes you need to grind a problem out thats operational other times you need to use your brain to make a decision thats slow thinking. Sometimes you're thinking about things but you're making no progress
