### Highlights

- We have a better picture of our ignorance than ever we know we can make AI using a computers but don’t know how to do it we know we have feeling but don’t know what is actually happening/ causing it Good explanations is the key to long term survival through creativity and criticism
    - **Tags:** #critical-approach-(conjectures-and-refutations), #good-explanations, #understanding-vs-simulating, #creativity, #ignorant-of-our-ignorance, #long-term-mindset
    - **Note:** We have never been more ignorant of our ignorance but true discovery cannot happen by simulating but only understanding.
- Progress is impossible in a field where you are pessimistic. Ideas move from misconception to misconception but hopefully also closer to a truth. knowledge is the transition from problems to better problems rather than problems to solutions. Optimism and reason are incompatible with being nearly there in a field there is objective truth to be found. He believed that what distinguishes science is that science can resolve questions objectively by experiment while philosophy cannot but can only produce multiple incompatible theories that can’t be verified there is objective truth in all fields but no fields have infallibility 2 types of ambiguity multiple true meanings which is based on deep complexity vs deliberate vanguness confusion or self contraction. Deep ideas vs deep silliness. If you take the latter then no ideas really have good or deep meanings

    - **Note:** Active optimism over pessimism. Deep complexity and multiple true meanings over a catch all deep silliness make things testable and low probability. We move from misconception to misconception problem to better problem. Objective truth exists.
- Climate change issues are forecast to put weight it’s benefits less people dying of starvation and hypothermia trillions are going towards reducing emissions based on super computer simulations that extrapolate without allowing room to innovate 1 we were lucky to avoid climate change issue 100 years ago when we had fewer resources like computers and underlying climate knowledge to overcome the issue 2 super computers make predictions while economic forecasts make prophecies our future response is heavily dependent on creating new knowledge you can’t compare predictions with prophecies We can’t know the future and sustainability only delays but doesn’t fix the problem we cannot know the future discoveries that will effect our actions and luck we encounter. Delaying doesn’t hurt but thus must not be subordinate to increasing ability to fix the situation after an unexpected disaster happens Instead of limiting solutions to reduction focus on how to remove carbon and create better ways of using energy. Aspire not to our current imagine and life style misconceptions and mistakes but choosing open ended journey of creation and exploration who’s every step is unsustainable until we figure it out with the next unsustainable step this is how we push toward the beginning of infinity

    - **Note:** Climate change is bad and sustainability is important, but you should always choose progress over sustainability because sustainability over the long run is unsustainable. It’s like we’re jumping from crumbling rock to crumbling rock to cross a chasm. We are constantly encountering life altering problems that we must overcome and we must do this through creating new knowledge not optimizing what we have. We cannot make point changes or slow the system we must make step change innovation to improve the system
      Progress over sustainability because sustainability is unsustainable
- 2 conceptions of people 1 pessimistic view of people as wasters they take an element an turn it into useless colored pictures that perform the same goal as as a monochrome tv. This is a static view like Easter island. People are the issue and sustainability ie cutting back is the cure 2 optimistic people as problem solvers they saw color television issues and reworked to create a better product/ world creators of the solution to the problem and creation of the next problem sustainability is the issue and humans are the cure The prophetic model of thinking is inherently biased but thinking we can just solve hard problems is equally as biased and wrong

    - **Note:** We jump from problem to problem. People as creators not wasters. This is similar to the theil idea. We must keep creating and living on the frontier. Sustainablilty is unsustainable we need progress and active optimism.
- Easter island was a primitive static society that failed to creativity and inability to create knowledge. The ability to create knowledge is the biggest opportunity and obstacle for humanity you can create strong progressive knowledge or strong reductionist knowledge. The people in Easter island had better resources than people in Brittan but their ideas were much worse and so they didn’t survive. The people of Easter island didn’t die because of environmental issues but because they couldn’t solve their problems

    - **Note:** Static societies die because their memes restrict the creation of new knowledge. Dynamic societies believe problems are inevitable and soluable and seek to create new innovations through dynamic memes. Progress and problem seeking societies who are actively optimistic. We succeed by solving our problems by creating knowledge. Cultural knowledge the value of memes and how they can be lost.
- Humans dint copy behavior they use conjecture and criticism to derive meaning. The human capacity for universal explanation didn’t evolve to have a universal function but to increase the volume of memetic information that could be acquired and how quickly/ accurately we could acquire it humans evolved because they could acquire better memes faster meme evolution. Memes dominate behavior and people develop more memes and those who developed memes were more creative and memes provided and advantage so creativity forged on. Human brains evolved to replicate memes. We learn memes and underlying points instead of knowing the words learn the memes

    - **Note:** Conjecture and criticism. Humans are meme replicators and use reason to choose and evolve memes. Humans create and transmit memes and the memes with good explanations and those whose explanations are better progress more the true route to progress is value creation over the long term. The best way to develop these memes is the critical approach
      Human evolution is meme evolution better the memes better the selection.
- Humans can improve and pass down knowledge through memes from a creative place and not just random mutations and trials and error that is a key differentiator behavior is impossible to inmitate without the underlying knowledge of what is causing the behavior
    - **Tags:** #explanatory-knowledge, #meme-evolution, #favorite, #evolution, #knowledge-(spread-of), #creation-of-new-knowledge
    - **Note:** meme evolution is how humans create and pass down knowledge. Memes are passed in both their behavior and their copying mechanism. You need memes to be both done and replicated to perpetuate the knowledge they hold. Meme evolution is key to human knowledge
- While static memes inhibit progress and present discovering infinity they are not wholly bad some static societies or organizations can be good and beneficial to all involved although knowledge isn’t being created. Deutche sees knowledge discovery as the only way forward through reason but some larger theories are harder to create and test like the organization of societies while there is a benefit to a global infinity and you need to be open to reaching it some blind algorithms might get there they will take longer though and not be optimized

    - **Note:** Society is defined by the ability to create and pass down effective memes. Meme vs gene evolution. We need to search on the edges of society. We need to search for objective truth but it can come from anywhere
      Static societies aren’t necessarily bad they just inhibit progress more likely to reach global infinity by dynamic memes
- Rational memes require the use of someone’s critical faculties to be adopted/ replicated Culture a set of shared ideas that cause their holders to behave alike in some ways Anti rational meme an idea that requires disabling critical faculties to be replicated Static culture or society one who’s changes happen on a timescale longer than the residents can notice dominants by anti rational memes Dynamic culture dominated by rational memes Memes are unbounded evolution Cultures consist of memes that evolve like genes but differ because each meme needs to include it’s own replication mechanism and a meme exists in 2 forms a mental representation and a behavior so selected for its ability to cause behavior and that behaviors ability to cause further meme adoption we don’t know why we enact memes as well as we can state them we know grammar more than we know why we use it 2 forms of replications to help the holders or disable the holders critical faculties. 2 types of memes rational and anti rational inhibit each other and the wider cultures ability to progress current situation is in between static irrational memes and critical rational memes

    - **Note:** memes exist to adopt grow or to stunt growth. Much of what plagued society is these anti rational memes and rational memes have been what has ushered in the new ideas of logic and enlightenment thinking. A culture is a manifestation of it's memes which exist in a mental model that triggers a behavior that must be useful enough to be repeated so the meme can propagate. Ration memes enable genies anti rational gollums or system 1 vs system 2. Good explanations vs scientism. Rational memes promote creation and critical thinking to live in anti rational memes disable these to do so.
      Memes are how humans transmit knowledge rational memes griw knowledge anti rational memes inhibit growth.
- Static societies survive by eliminating the type of evolution that is unique to memes ie creative variation intended to meet the holders preferences memes are constantly evolving through thoughts and opinions developed over a lifetime. Static societies normally settle issues by violence and sacrifice the individual for changes in society. Either a society is static or they evolved very quickly

    - **Note:** static societies seek to destroy creativity and creation where dynamic societies are truth seeking for growth over the long term. Static societies are fixed in their ways and dogmatic while dynamic societies evolve very quickly through meme evolution. Genie vs gollum. Static societies slow the learning rate to stunt progress
- There is an objective beauty in art that attracts animals to certain things and humans are pursuing some level of objective beauty that exists and is reachable with more knowledge. Art is about creating something new not self expression pure art is objective beauty we know something good when we see it a good piece can be made by a deaf composer there is some objective beauty. Real progress is hard and there are many errors/ failures for every success. Future art can lead to unlimited increases in beauty. There are standard truths in aethetics linked to factual ones by explanations and also because artistic problems can emerge from physical situations/ facts like flowers seeming beautiful to humans when designs evolved for other reasons is evidence that beauty is objective convergent criteria of beauty show hard to forge signals where priory shared knowledge is insufficient to prove them

    - **Note:** Objective beauty exists due to the resonance of things as beautiful across species. There are things that are beautiful to humans and these are deeply complex and hard to figure out but we should be able to reason about these from good explanations.
      There is objective cross species beauty even if we cannot know why
- Government and the most representative nature of it. Large portion on how many seats in the house was most representative but there is always going to be trade offs. A proportional system of government puts the 3rd largest party in power because they become king markers making the party it aligns with the majority tyranny of the minority. While in a plurality system one party is in complete power and then another needs to come up with better explanations to get into power. This leads to a competition for better explanations and eventually moves toward optimal explanations. Decision making is not just selecting from a list of options according to a fixed formula because it omits the creation of knowledge and new choices good policies are hard to vary and conflicting policies are hard to mix compromise just leads to 2 unhappy parties it’s not about weighing the options but using reason to decide what is best. Good governments are defined by their ability to remove bad rulers/ policies

    - **Note:** Good government is defined by its ability to remove bad rulers. A 2 party system is better because it allows explanations to be tested without compromise and removed if bad. 3rd party system ends up being tyranny of the minority. Good policies are hard to vary so compromise shouldn’t be good and leaves everyone upset. Decision making involves creation of new knowledge centrally.
      Decision making requires knowledge creation.
- Heisenberg the physical variables of a particle don’t have values but are matrices related in probabilistic ways to the outcome of observations of the variables the multiplicity exists because a variable has different values for an event at different areas of the multiverse. Represented a wave moving through space. Schrodinger and Heisenbergs theory merged with a rule - Whenever a measurement is made all the histories but 1 cease to exist with the 1 chosen at random with the probability of each possible outcome equal to the total measure of all the histories in which that outcomes occurs
    - **Tags:** #uncertainty-principle, #heisenberg, #favorite, #uncertainty, #multiverse, #probabilitic-thinking, #schrodinger, #definitions, #motivation, #world-altering-moment, #writing-topics
    - **Note:** This is multiverse theory that says the uncertainty principle is a multiversal fact and when we measure we destroy all other universes but ours. The wave is all histories but we only see one when we measure that’s multiverse. Schrodinger and Heisenberg are both right Just in different universal views.
- Multiverse starts with 2 identical universes with all the same bases except there is one thing that is deterministic and is fungible meaning that it is exactly the same ie a dollar in a bank account is just a number and is exactly the same as any other dollar as it’s just bits in a computer. If objects are identical and obey deterministic laws they can never become different but fungible objects can become different. Interference can lead to histories merging if they are exactly the same their histories can merge. Quantum interference is out best proof of the multiverse. To show this you shoot a photon at a semi silver mirror half the time it bounces off the other half it goes through then strike a second mirror interference makes both photons go in the same direction. All fiction in one history is fact in another ie alternative histories stories

    - **Note:** Fungibility of atoms allows for different universes and the existence of a Multiverse, that is projected by our best theories
- When societies have a choice and people differ on what is the optimal choice what do you do? How does it choose what it wants and how should society organize decision making so it can make the decision it wants
    - **Tags:** #decision-making, #critical-approach-(conjectures-and-refutations)
    - **Note:** how societies makes decisions are big keys in their success or failure
- Error is the natural state of knowledge and false philosophy isn’t bad philosophy as through criticism and good explanations one can get a more right answer through good philosophy. Because I said so is bad philosophy because it is a bad explanation because it could explain anything it rests on the person who said it not the ideas it swaps truth for justification it confuses human authority with non existent authority for ideas so it stands outside the realm of criticism. Logical positivism statements that are mot verifiable are not only worthless but meaningless. Post modernism or structuralism because all ideas are conjectural and hard to justify they are no more than stories or narratives objective truth and reality that stand for ideas pushed by a power group but nothing right everything is narrative. Aims to split predictions of philosophy and rules for reality in 2. Bad philosophy denies the possibility of progress and progress is the only effective way of opposing bad philosophy. Study of counting people at a museum you count people going in and out and if they don’t match you define this as spontaneous combustion or arrival and maybe aliens teleported in shows how ridiculous bad philosophy can be

    - **Note:** Error is the natural state of knowledge but that is ok as long as we are basing our ideas of good explanations then we can clearly test and falsify or reaffirm the thinking we have. The because I said so is justified true belief and appeals to a higher power and much like post modernism the world isn't just the stories we tell ourselves there are structural and underlying truths. Ideas are wrong we just need to create incremental improvements in ours. intellectual honesty humility and truth seeking create progress not justified true belief.
      Use the critical approach to improve ideas not accept things are just stories and descend into insanity
      It’s ok to be wrong but acting in bad faith stunts knowledge growth.
- Quantum interference is how we know about the multiverse the laws of motion of the multiverse are deterministic variables are generally discrete but change through multiverse interference and fungibility
    - **Tags:** #fungibility, #quantum-computing, #multiverse, #multiverse-(interference-effects), #quantum-vs-classical-systems
- Being perfectly secure in ones beliefs rejects all future knowledge being secure vs discovering the truth of the world as it should be. All knowledge comes from within through conjecture and criticism. We first guess what is there then hone our guesses testing vs input from senses and fashion the best one into our best picture of reality. Constantly trying to improve vs rejecting improvements. The history of science is not as important as the ideas Einstein’s feelings about relativity don’t effect its use as an explanation. Overtime the world will converge on good explanations
    - **Tags:** #good-explanations, #truth-seeking-(vs-being-right), #critical-approach-(conjectures-and-refutations), #constant-steady-growth, #lifelong-learning
    - **Note:** Knowledge comes from conjecture and criticism we can always grow within ourselves. We first make bold conjectures then work to improve those. We try to hone our best understanding of reality and over time we come to good explanations
- Seeing barriers as problems and problems as solvable is a positive EV bet on the future. What a civilization aspired to be must be more important than what it had become. Optimistic civilizations know problems are hard but solvable not be afraid of criticism and embracing creativity. Detect and Eliminate errors
    - **Tags:** #favorite, #fallability-(of-knowledge), #optimism, #risk-and-return, #critical-approach-(conjectures-and-refutations), #problems-(are-inevitable-and-soluable), #progress-(from-wrong-to-less-wrong), #creation-of-new-knowledge, #goals-(set-lofty-goals), #optimism-(active-sense), #believe-in-yourself
    - **Note:** Problems are inevitable and soluble we progress from problem to problem and we must remain optimistic in our ability to solve problems but understand it will be hard. Hard does not mean improbable because sometimes hard problems are the only ones worth solving. You need to conceive of something and believe in yourself before you can accomplish it.
- Prediction is a conclusion about the future based on good explanations prophecy which claims to know something unknowable. You couldn’t have predicted the internet before computers it was unknowable. Knowing the unknowable leads to error and pessimism about the future sometimes we need to admit we don’t know because we truly don’t. All our predictions are biased by our errors inherent in our models. How can you prepare to a future beyond prediction? How do you plan for the unknowable. Blind optimism and pessimism are two sides of the same coin Optimism all evils are caused by insufficient knowledge. Optimism is a way of explaining failure not prophesying success there is nothing preventing progress other than our knowledge about the task at that time. Nearly all failures and successes are yet to happen if something isn’t prevented by the laws of physics the only barrier is knowledge. If progress is to be made some of the discoveries are inconceivable in advance progress can’t take place unless someone is open to and prepares for inconceivable possibilities. While the prisoner cannot know what will save his life is optimistic bet on an emergent future property. Doing something that is hard doesn’t mean it is unlikely just that it needs a lot of knowledge to achieve optimist expects new knowledge to create new progress

    - **Note:** Prediction exists only within the current paradigm and is biased by our models we can’t know the unknown unknowns. We must maintain active optimism that we can solve problems that are hard but only through hard work to create progress. 
      Maintain optionality for tail risk. Keep active optimism failure is only a lack of knowledge. Prediction prophecy and active optimism
- Proof is a physical contruct this chapter tackles the infinity hotel thought experiment and how we will be at the beginning of infinity always tackles mathematical with physical infinites
    - **Tags:** #infinity
- We can’t develop AI until we have good explanations for consciousness because if we can’t explain something well how can we hope to create it versus simulate it. One can make a program but we can’t jump to universality without truly understanding he underlying mechanics. We can’t program creativity until we know what it is
  Analogs to the turing test how can you perfectly replicate something you don’t know but also you can basically do it. Does thinking and inventions of idea come from synthesis and analogs or does it what is human creativity and thinking. What is true creative thought. Does turning a rolling tree into a wheel count as thought or does putting something on the rolling tree just count as thought or is it all thought into the car from the carridge or do you just say lets take the buggy and put a motor in it which already exists and we will have a car and better yet lets use the manufacturing facilities we already have to build them at scale so there is no real thinking here or creativity yet there is a bunch of real thinking and creativity here so what gives. What is going on here. Similarly with thinking fast and slow that is how we avoid bias and it walks us through some of how we trick ourselves but not how we creatively think. The whole point of phycology is figuring out where humans are obviously wrong not where humans are obviously right because its so hard to figure out why humans are obviously right.

    - **Note:** Deutche says we can’t make something that we don’t fully understand that only through deep understanding can we truly make something not just a copy or good imitation not a recreation. What is the true Nature of thought and creativity what is true creation. Psychology is just about understanding what humans do wrong not where they may be right.
      Understanding vs simulating and true nature of creative thought
- All knowledge growth come from incremental improvement but at one point one small incremental improvement causes an outsized increase in reach which creates a universal system in the relevant domain this is a jump to universality which has been sought since the enlightenment because error correction is necessary for universal processes of infinite length this jump only happens in digital systems

    - **Note:** Incremental change in a system reaches the activation energy to cause a jump to universality. Universal systems are incredibly powerful and should be sought out. Mason hits a rock 1000 times but the last hit isn’t the one that breaks it.
      Jump to universality power of universal systems.
- Universal symbols versus descriptive symbols. Pictographs are intuitive and easy but to use then everyone has to know the meaning even if a circle is sun. An alphabet is much harder to learn but once you have it you can create infinitely more symbols infinite reach. Before the jump to universality one needs to make specialized objects for everything new after one creates ikr custom specialized machine that programs everything from then on. Computers as universal machines DNA was the first universal machine coding for everything with 4 letters and what they coded for animals and traits to make everything from bacteria to humans and could further code things like birds building nets or humans making a computer

    - **Note:** Universality is the goal of systems and a universal system is exponentially more useful than a system with point solutions. Like the alphabet or DNA system construction is much harder but once it’s in place it provides orders of magnitude more leverage.
      Power of universal systems. Work up front to get universal systems with infinite leverage. Universal systems have immense power, but are hard to create
- Not all theories need to be tested dumb theories can be known as wrong without being tested because good explanations exist in other area like philosophy. You can’t define an ought from an is so morality can’t be justified from reason but if we can craft good explanations for right and wrong you can justify morality from reason. Don’t justify beliefs but craft good moral explanations. Individual scientist is need to value truth and good explanations while being open to ideas and change while society needs to value tolerance integrity and openness to debate the truth has structural unity and logical consistency across fields. Since the universe is explicable morally correct and incorrect values are as well. Just because something isn’t tangible doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist things can be abstract like a math proof or morals and still be real even though empirically they aren’t real

    - **Note:** You don’t need to prove everything some things are obvious enough to be rejected before proving. That being said morality does have objective truth within itself. Morality is objective the universe is explicable society needs to be tolerant while the individual needs to be truth seeking.
- Reductionism is purely bottom up. Ie why is a copper atom outside of parliament is because it’s on a Winston Churchill statue because of culture and war and many high level emergent phenomena but going from bottom up the creation of the atom to how it ends up on the statue is near impossible to predict knowing nothing about the high level ie Churchill was important worked in parliament we celebrate important people and we use material that has copper. While you can go through how it made it through it’s formation into being mined ect. Is possible/ intractable but from a high level it’s clear why it exists so it’s a better explanation than pure reductionism
    - **Tags:** #good-explanations, #levels-of-emergence, #emergent-behavior, #bottoms-up-not-top-down, #bad-philosophy, #reductionist, #intractable-problems
    - **Note:** Sometimes reductionism can be an intractable explanation and as a result it becomes important to understand things through high level knowledge structure like emergent phenomena
- If an entity is referred to by our best explanation in a field it exists if not it doesn’t exist in our best explanation we have to assume it doesn’t ie gravity. Emergent phenomenon can be well explained at a high level alone and self contained without considering lower levels. We can’t know how every water molecule will flow but we don’t need to to know how to boil water.
    - **Tags:** #emergent-behavior, #levels-of-emergence, #good-explanations, #knowledge-discovery, #knowledge-creating-entities, #accept-best-explt
    - **Note:** Some ideas make more sense at different levels of emergence and become more explicable in that sweet spot. Our knowledge is defined by our best explanations in the field
- Evolution and human knowledge are similar in the way of genes and ideas being replicators with knowledge and adaptations being hard to vary the difference is human knowledge can be explanatory and have great reach while adaptations are reactive subject to changing conditions. Biological evolution doesn’t help the organism or even the gene but just the genes ability to reproduce

    - **Note:** Meme and gene evolution are similar, but memes and human knowledge have greater reach because they create universal explanations while genes reproduce to a niche they don’t learn global but locally. You can argue that genes explain how to survive in niche and so they’re explanatory, but human knowledge is just explanatory in a wider niche of the universe. Different niches.
- Problems are inevitable and humans are only limited by the laws of physics. 2 ideas we can attain perfection or we can never be perfect we can always at the beginning of infinity. Problems are soluble and inevitable. People are the most significant cosmic entity they are not supported by nature but create knowledge to shape their environment and create further progress evolution is the only other process that creates knowledge but human knowledge is unbounded
- Correct errors with understanding our theories are wrong but they’re the greatest source of truth we have good explanations are precise and specific bad explanations are general and easy to pivot from the reach of an explanation is a property of the explanation and how good/ universal it is

    - **Note:** Good explanations are our goal and we are always wrong, but we need to work hard to refine what we know as best and possible and be ruthless with finding errors and improving our thinking. Good explanations are specific hard to vary and have reach.
- When theories are too variable they explain nothing. Think the gambler who says tonight is his night if he losses he can just say tomorrow is there is no direct correlation or prediction. Myths while theories and testable are not great explanations further just refuting a theory without a new one on offer is just as bad. Easily variable theories help us fool ourselves good explanations is the key don’t listen to authorities seek good explanations across fields and open to criticism

    - **Note:** A good theory has reach and is specific a bad theory is so general as to always be right. Good explanations being open to criticism. Even if we know something is wrong you can't refute it until we have something better because all knowledge is wrong so we know whatever we say is wrong.
- All experience is guided through theories we know so we must start with theory think a blue sky we need to know what blue and sky even are before and even the theory of colors ect
    - **Tags:** #bias-(inherent-in-models), #good-explanations, #understand-the-problem
    - **Note:** This is a prime example of bias inherent in models. We can’t know things without having a lexicon that describes them. We need good explanations for understanding
- Knowledge is seen as” justified true belief, justified, true belief, where ‘justified’ means designated as true (or at least ‘probable’) by reference to some authoritative source or touchstone of knowledge.” We claim we know something by some authority and this is a request for certainty not truth. There are no authoritative sources of knowledge nor ways to justify ideas of being true or probable is fallabalism. Understanding what is really there through fallabalism and expect even the fundamental explanations to have both the truth and misconceptions versus justificationism is finding ideas against change. Find issues with past theories while also creating and growing new knowledge
  We should not view life through the justified true belief lens that everything needs some authoritative source of truth the I said so argument. Rather we should defer to fallabalism we expect our best fundamental explanations to be false but this doesn’t mean they are wholly wrong. We are aware we cannot be fully right and each point of knowledge is just the beginning of an infinity. Through fallabism we will get to better explantions because we will settle on good ones but contantly aim to improve them
    - **Tags:** #justified-true-belief, #fallability-(of-knowledge), #critical-approach-(conjectures-and-refutations), #error-(natural-state-of-knowledge), #beginning-of-infinity
    - **Note:** Justified true belief is false and while using conjectures we know were fallible we can get closer to the truth. Error is the natural state of knowledge and each tid bit of truth we pick up is the beginning of infinity. We must be active optimistic and conjectural in our quest for knowledge.
- The discoverer of knowledge is its passive recipient not its creator. Scientific ideas are just bold guesses based on past ideas and thought + experience. Experimental science and inductive reasoning from the past does not lead to progress it serves only as a test. Thinking the future will be more like the past is not good grounds for a future theory. The unseen is not like the seen. Science brings about very different phenomena from what has been experienced through scientific theory. People did not fly for 2000 years but then after a good theory of flight then they were able to fly. Inductive would say never fly but through theory they could fly. If you can derive predictions from experience one can’t derive and explanation. Explanation comes from creativity

    - **Note:** Explanations are true creations. You can derive prediction from experience but not explanations. Thinking the future wil be like the past is not only unlikely but rejects innovation and creation so it’s counter productive and wrong. Science relies on bold conjectures.
- Progress moves by good explanations and is unbounded. There is no end to progress but there is a beginning.
    - **Tags:** #good-explanations, #beginning-of-infinity
- Progress moves by good explanations and is unbounded. There is no end to progress but there is a beginning. Problems are inevitable and soluble through good explanations. if something isn’t prevented by the laws of physics it can be known the limits of the physical universe is the only barrier is knowledge. Knowledge is a deep universal truth such that if you looked across the multiverse you would see similar structures and these are knowledge created beings
  Inductivism vs Justified True belief vs fallablism – the only way we improve is through the creation of knowledge through good explanations
  Inductivism – A+B = C while this makes sense there are clearly limits to that. The Thanksgiving Turkey problem among others
  Justified True Belief – the I said so justification where ‘justified’ means designated as true (or at least ‘probable’) by reference to some authoritative source or touchstone of knowledge.” We claim we know something by some authority and this is a request for certainty not truth.

    - **Note:** Progress only moves through good explanations and there is no end to progress only a beginning. The only thing we can't do is not physically possible everything else just a lack of knowledge. Multiversal knowledge structures are deep universal truth
      Justified true belief and inductivism are not ways to innovation but poor forms of optimization
- Fallabalism - There are no authoritative sources of knowledge nor ways to justify ideas of being true or probable is fallabalism. Understanding what is really there through fallabalism and expect even the fundamental explanations to have both the truth and misconceptions versus justificationism is finding ideas against change. Find issues with past theories while also creating and growing new knowledge. You are not wholly right or wholly wrong you just need to constantly be moving closer to the objective truth
    - **Tags:** #objective-truth, #fallability-(of-knowledge), #justified-true-belief
    - **Note:** Fallabalism we are never wholly right or wrong in any of our beliefs. The natural state of our knowledge is error mixed with some value and so we need to grow the base of our knowledge and respect the fallability of it.

- Bad Philosophy
  Bad philosophy denies the possibility of progress and progress is the only effective way of opposing bad philosophy. Study of counting people at a museum you count people going in and out and if they don’t match you define this as spontaneous combustion or arrival and maybe aliens teleported in shows how ridiculous bad philosophy can be

    - **Note:** Bad philosophy prorogates in static societies and is founded in fitting the world to your beliefs rather than falsifying your beliefs to get to the truth
- The multiverse follows from our best explanations about the universe 
  Quantum interference is how we know about the multiverse the laws of motion of the multiverse are deterministic variables are generally discrete but change through multiverse interference and fungibility

- Optimistic civilization agree problems are inevitable and soluble
  Seeing barriers as problems and problems as solvable is a positive EV bet on the future. What a civilization aspired to be must be more important than what it had become. Optimistic civilizations know problems are hard but solvable not be afraid of criticism and embracing creativity. Detect and Eliminate errors

    - **Note:** We progress from problem to problem we must believe that we can solve them and then actually do it. We must aspire to be much more than we can realistically be. If we don’t aim high and believe we can get there we’ll never even get close. Need to believe in yourself before you do anything. Believe in yourself eliminate error.
- Prediction is impossible because you cannot predict emergent phenomena that just prophesizing
  Prediction is a conclusion about the future based on good explanations prophecy which claims to know something unknowable. You couldn’t have predicted the internet before computers it was unknowable. All our predictions are biased by our errors inherent in our models. How can you prepare to a future beyond prediction? How do you plan for the unknowable. Blind optimism and pessimism are two sides of the same coin Optimism all evils are caused by insufficient knowledge. There is nothing preventing progress other than our knowledge about the task at that time. If progress is to be made some of the discoveries are inconceivable in advance progress can’t take place unless someone is open to and prepares for inconceivable possibilities.

    - **Note:** Prediction of unknown unknowns is impossible. It's a conclusion about the future, which is unknowable. You can't predict the internet before computers. You can prepare for the future by actively being optimisitic and trying to solve problems. Prepare don’t predict. Regardless, we need to be open to progress.
- The jump to Universality/ power
  Universality out of few comes infinite using 26 letter and memes such as agreed pronunciation and grammer we can create any word possible and define that as a subset of other existing words to create universal knowledge
  All knowledge growth come from incremental improvement but at one point one small incremental improvement causes an outsized increase in reach which creates a universal system in the relevant domain this is a jump to universality which has been sought since the enlightenment because error correction is necessary for universal processes of infinite length this jump only happens in digital systems
    - **Tags:** #simplicity-(power-of), #universality, #jump-to-universality, #knowledge-gain, #computation, #favorite, #daily-compounding, #power-law
    - **Note:** As you grow knowledge incrementally in a digital system one day you hit a point where that system becomes universal and can create anything like alphabets over hieroglyphs. These jumps are rare and these systems are powerful. Small daily compounding with an upside tail return, is this a true power law maybe not but in the way that 99% of the work towards universality gets you 1% of the results then 1% more of work that unlocks the jump to it. build universal systems

- Good vs Bad theories –
  Theories are very specific not easily variable and we cannot disprove a theory without offering a better one. We know all our theories are wrong, so proving the obvious doesn’t invalidate it as our best currently explanation
    - **Tags:** #probability-(make-low-probability-predictions-leading-to-more-knowledge-gain), #theories-(creation-of), #progress-(from-wrong-to-less-wrong), #theories-(hard-to-vary-and-testible), #theories-(must-be-replaced-with-better-explantions), #fallability-(of-knowledge), #critical-approach-(conjectures-and-refutations), #favorite, #definitions
    - **Note:** Make theories specific improbable and hard to vary. This leads to the most knowledge gain and falsifiability. We know all our theories are wrong so proving invalidity isn’t as important as creating a better new explanation
- Knowledge creating entities
  People are the most significant cosmic entity they are not supported by nature but create knowledge to shape their environment and create further progress evolution is the only other process that creates knowledge but human knowledge is unbounded. Evolution and human knowledge are similar in the way of genes and ideas being replicators with knowledge and adaptations being hard to vary the difference is human knowledge can be explanatory and have great reach while adaptations are reactive subject to changing conditions. Biological evolution doesn’t help the organism or even the gene but just the genes ability to reproduce
  Reductionism vs good explantions

    - **Note:** The reach of humans explanations and knowledge creating entities. Humans are one of the few entities to ever create knowledge and we create not just knowledge within a niche like evolution but explanatory knowledge with reach
- While there is a reductionist explantion to everything that isn’t always the best explantion. Using emergent phenoia to explain systems behavior is a better explanation than a reductionist one
  Ie why is a copper atom outside of parliament is because it’s on a Winston Churchill statue because of culture and war and many high level emergent phenomena but going from bottom up the creation of the atom to how it ends up on the statue is near impossible to predict knowing nothing about the high level ie Churchill was important worked in parliament we celebrate important people and we use material that has copper. While you can go through how it made it through it’s formation into being mined ect. Is possible/ intractable but from a high level it’s clear why it exists so it’s a better explanation than pure reductionism
    - **Tags:** #good-explanations, #reductionist, #levels-of-emergence, #emergent-behavior, #bottoms-up-and-top-down, #favorite, #simple-as-possible-no-simpler
    - **Note:** Different explanations make sense at different levels of emergence. Some phenomena make sense in the bottoms up point of view while others make sense more top down. The copper atoms makes more sense through the ideas of government and material science than the random probabilistic movement of atoms. We need to look at different levels of emergence for the right explanation use explanations not brute force.
      Explain through emergence not reductionism
- many scientific breakthroughs took many years to come to fruition and acceptance—just because people think it’s crazy at first doesn’t mean they always will; perhaps they look back in 5 years and wish they had thought otherwise
