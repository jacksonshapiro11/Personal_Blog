### Highlights

- Balance ambition and drive don’t hate yourself too much to never enjoy success nor not have enough fire to feel that success. This is push and pull motivation. One you force the other is from obsession. Pursuit while enjoying the moment. engineer and structure your life for more happiness. Hero’s journey of life. Something calls you to adventure. Your life is ordinary then something happens in your life like someone gets sick and you need to embark on a journey and you transform personally in that process. You need to hear then take the call. Meet new challenges and eventually you slay your dragons you live your experience and you come out with a new sense of ownership because this is something you’ve lived not just a story but your life. Everyone feels you lived it then you get another journey. Focus on the right things ignore the wrong things. We experience the life we focus on. Then we attribute meaning and emotions to that thing find our meaning. Then that informs our actions what are we gonna do. We need to focus on what’s happening not what’s missing. Do you focus on what you can or can’t control do you focus on the past present or future.

  And what it was, was I was like, shit, what I'm doing doesn't matter. This guy's got 15,000 people here. I got 125 for three days. I'm not making any difference at all. And I was like, and I literally was, we were walking out and people were born around. I was pissy inside myself, you know, like, but I was feeling so great before this, but not making this comparison. And of course you're never fair. You're comparing to somebody else's life that has a totally different path, a totally different experience. We all develop in different stages and different things. We all want different things. But what was ironic though, the reason I tell you the story is it was like four years later and there I am in that stadium and I'm not doing this crappy little two and a half hour concert, Right? I'm doing 12 hours and the crowd's going crazy. Screw you, Bruce. And I just like, no, it was just like, you know, it was humorous. You get to look back and say, you know, you judge yourself too soon. And I can tell you a dozen stories like that with me. So I was so hard on myself. But eventually you wake up and say, it's good to be strong with yourself, but beating yourself up just lowers your energy. And when your energy gets lower, you produce less, right? You don't have, and you don't have the same level of joy. You don't have the impact that you want to have, nor do you have the excitement that you really want to have. So I look at it as something that it's worth earning your own self-esteem, but it's really not the secret. The secret is to find something else you obsess about more than yourself, and you'll have a level of energy that will compel you over the long term.
  Chris Williamson
  It's that tension, this interesting tension between balancing ambition and gratitude. Yes. And this fear that, well, if I pat myself on the back too much, what if that stops ([Time 0:04:35](https://share.snipd.com/snip/45a36aaf-b349-4534-986e-efbaf0cc8160))
- **The Hero's Journey and Three Decisions**
  - Tony Robbins describes life's challenges as a hero's journey, beginning with a call to adventure (often a crisis).
  - This journey involves mentors, battles, and ultimately slaying dragons, leading to personal growth and valuable lessons.
  - Robbins emphasizes three daily decisions: what to focus on, what it means, and what to do.
  - He illustrates this with a childhood anecdote about a Thanksgiving stranger's generosity and his father's prideful rejection, highlighting the impact of focus and meaning on actions.
  - Robbins concludes that focusing on what's missing hinders sustained happiness, especially during challenging times like the COVID pandemic.

  Tony Robbins
  It's like, I think spiritual development, when people talk about spiritual, not religious development, spiritual development is the level of comfort you can have with just being Your real self. And I think that's not an easy task because we all are trying to be something, but we already are the something we're trying to be. That doesn't mean you can't be better, but it's like accepting and appreciating what you really are. And instead of projecting something else, it takes a lot of pain out of your body, it takes a lot of wasted energy out, it gets a lot of fears to just disappear. And I don't have an easy path for that. I think it's the hero's journey. You know, what is it? Your life is ordinary and everything seems fine. And then something hits you and it's the call to adventure. It doesn't feel like a call. It feels like somebody in your family's got cancer. It feels like, you know, COVID and somebody shut down your business, you know, or, you know, some issue that's happening in your relationship with your kids. But if you take the call and you go on the journey, you're going to meet some new friends. You're going to find some new mentors. You're going to, you know, you're going to battle with internal things within you and external things. But if you keep going, you're going to eventually slay your dragons and you come out in the hero of your own life and you have something to share that isn't bullshit. It's not something you read somewhere. It's something you've lived.
  Chris Williamson
  Something you want.
  Tony Robbins
  And everybody can feel you've lived it because it's a different level of ownership, you know. And then, by the way, as soon as you do that, it happens again. You're called on another journey. You have a new level of challenge that you need to go on. It just never ends. But it makes life really, really beautiful.
  Chris Williamson
  One of the things that I've been hearing you talk about a lot recently that seems to tie into this is the difference in life between when you focus on things that are wrong and when you focus On things that are right. And I think a lot of people have managed to achieve quite a bit of success by avoiding pitfalls. You know, you present them with something they can say, well, that's wrong and that's going to be an issue. And we need to make sure that that's sorted there. But as you've said, the things that you focus on seem to appear more frequently in your life. And if you have, if you've justified to yourself and if you've built up this habit, this stack of evidence that it's useful for me to focus on where potential pitfalls may be and make sure That I can avoid them. But I don't want to do it in my personal life. You've developed this pattern and that is now going to be ported over into everything so when your partner comes through the door and does something that pisses you off the first thing That you don't think is i'm so grateful to have her but she's so she's so wonderful think about all of the things it's like she fucking left the makeup's out on the counter again and she Didn't clean up the such and such. So just dig into that difference between focusing on what's right versus focusing on what's wrong when it comes to your trajectory in life.
  Tony Robbins
  I think it's important to realize wherever focus goes, energy flows. It's corny, but it's true, right? In fact, maybe an easier way of saying it is we don't experience life. None of us do. We experience the life we focus on. So in any moment, what's wrong is always available. So is what's right. So it's not about being positive. It's about being intelligent, right? You know, when you're in a totally negative state and the world's going to end and there are people like believing that in the next 12 years, the entire environment's going to collapse And they won't have a child. You know, you got to look at the impact of what you're believing and you got to look at and say, you know, where's my focus going? There's, I can always be upset about something. I can always find something to be joyous or at least grateful for, which leads to joy. And I think it's having that, learning to discipline your disappointments, you know, not allow them to grow and to move on and to use whatever life is giving you. But to me, it's like, I think there's three decisions that people make every moment of their life. Now, I'm not saying they make them consciously. If you make them unconsciously, you have the same patterns over and over again. And usually they're not good ones, right? And sometimes they're good, but not usually. And I learned these really because I had an experience when I was 11 years old. I had, I was my fourth father and he got fired and we had no money and no food. We were always poor, but I mean, we wouldn't have starved. We had saltine crackers and peanut butter, right? But when everybody else around you is having a big Thanksgiving dinner, it was pretty depressing. And my mom and dad were saying things to each other that once you save them, you can't take them back. And I have a younger brother, five years younger, and a younger sister, seven years younger. So I felt like the parent almost. I'm trying to protect them. I'm only 11 years old. And what changed my life is this bang on the door. I go open the door and there's this guy, big guy with groceries in both hands. And he had a pot on the ground with an uncooked turkey. And he looks at me and says, is your father here? And I'm like, just one moment. I'm just like, this to me was like Christmas, right? This is the greatest thing. It's going to stop the fighting. It's going to be incredible. So I go to my father and I say, you know, dad, dad, somebody at the door for you. And he's yelling at my mom through the closed door that she slammed on him. And he goes, you answer. I said, I did. It's for you. He goes, who is it? I said, I don't know. They said, they got to talk to you. Right. And I had this level of excitement, like little boy excitement, like this is going to be the greatest thing. And my dad opens the door and I'll never forget the look on his face. He got angry, which shocked me. And he said to the man, we don't accept charity before the guy even said anything. And he went to slam the door and the guy had leaned in slightly. So it hit his shoulder and it bounced off of him, which made my dad even madder. And then he said, he goes, sir, sir, I'm just the delivery guy. You know, somebody knows you're having a tough time. Everyone has a tough time and they just want you to have a great Thanksgiving with your family. My father says, we don't accept charity. He goes to slam it again. But I think because he leaned in, his foot came in. Now it hit his foot and bounced open again. Now I got fear runs in my body because I know my father, right? And my father looks at him and the guy looks at him and says something. I thought my father was going to punch him in the face. And he didn't do it mean. He had a softness in his face and he said, sir he saw me. And he said, don't make your family suffer because of your ego. And the veins of my father's side of his neck were like this. He's pretty red. I thought for sure he was going to punch the guy. And then all of a sudden his shoulders dropped, like defeated. He took the groceries. He slammed them on the ground, slammed the door, didn't even pick up a turkey and didn't say thank you or anything. And shortly after ...

- Achievers are driven by anticipation, which provides a sense of control and fuels their drive. Always important to anticipate. While focusing on the future is beneficial for achievement, true joy resides in the present.
  Transcript:
  Tony Robbins
  And that's where most achievers live. We do. I have to discipline myself not to do that because what makes you an achiever is anticipation. You've learned by a long time, anticipation is power. As I'm listening, I'm watching you, you're anticipating, you're processing, right?
  Chris Williamson
  Dopamine's a hell of a drug, yeah.
  Tony Robbins
  Yes, it does. And it gives you a sense of control. And also, if you don't anticipate, it's like playing a video game against the child. Now, you're a different generation, so you might kick the child's ass, I don't know. But my generation, I didn't play any video games. So if a child is your nephew or your niece or your grandson, granddaughter, or your son or daughter, and you give them a gift, let's say of playing a video game, you give them a new video Game for Christmas or their birthday, what's the first thing? Oh, look, come play with me, pops. Come play with me, uncle. Come play. No, no, no. I don't do those things. Oh, let me show you. It's so easy. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Three shots. Boom, boom. They're going great. So some part of you finally says, I'll show this little bastard something here. I'll go ahead and do this thing here. All right, fine. Give me this thing. But you should know you're being set up when the kid says something to you, like you go first. And so you go and you go boom, boom, boom, boom. And you're dead in four seconds, right? The kid goes, not bad, not bad for the first time, right? And then they take the thing up, and 45 minutes later, you get your second turn, right? Now you're really pissed. Maybe you make it two minutes and the kid goes for another 45. Why does the kid win every time? Is it because they're smarter, faster, younger? No, it's because they played this game before. They can anticipate the first bad guy's here, the second bad guy's here. You're in reaction, they're anticipating. So it has tremendous power. So it's addictive when you learn to anticipate. And it's also a great skill set for business, for life, and so forth. I always tell people, if you're running a business, you're always running two businesses, the business you're in and the business you're becoming. If you only focus on the business you're in, someone's going to replace you. If you only focus on what you're going to become, you're going to have the cash flow to be able to get to that place, right? So it's a very similar situation inside of where we are. So for each of us, most ([Time 0:25:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a500cf93-5687-4569-a914-a4a26a0bcfff))
- **Improving Mental State**
  * Control your focus and internal world, not the external world which is beyond your control.
  * Find meaning and purpose, and act to serve something greater than yourself.
  * Why are people who take anti depressants still so depressed it’s because depression is structural more than anything
  Transcript:
  Tony Robbins
  Difficult. So there's been some growth in your psychology, your spirit, your soul, to say the least, right? So the contrast of remembering where you were and who you've become is probably a beautiful thing. But if you use it that way, but most people go back and they ruminate about the past or they ruminate about a future that they can't control and the presence there. So the goal is ideal is fuel. The ideal fuel is a combination of the two. Present, it gives you that centered grounding and anticipation for the future. The ability to bounce back and forth is the ideal for people. So I'll give you an example to wrap this up. Do you know anybody who has, I asked this when I have an audience, you know giant audience, how many of you will say, know somebody who takes antidepressants and they're still depressed? Yes.
  Chris Williamson
  Yes.
  Tony Robbins
  90% of the room will raise their hand. How's that possible? Because first of all, two years ago, they did meta studies on the cover of Newsweek and it said SSRIs do not work. Sugar pills work as well as SSRIs.
  Chris Williamson
  Dancing. Dancing to music was more effective by some huge margin.
  Tony Robbins
  Yeah, you read the study. We're still giving to everybody. Doesn't make any sense.
  Chris Williamson
  Should be salsa classes.
  Tony Robbins
  It's just, but it's just, you think of the insanity of that, of us continue to do what doesn't make any sense. So I think, you know, your question is really focus, getting it back to the focus. I think if we make the right decisions, the first one is what we're going to focus on. And that's just a habit. You change anything. Take that person. Why is that person depressed still? Because all that drug does is numb you. And numbing doesn't deal with the issue. What's the real issue? You're constantly focused on what's missing versus what you have. You're focused on what you can't control. And there's two worlds, right? The external world, the internal world. We can't control the external world. We can influence it. We can't control it. If you think you're in control, you have a deep illusion. I went to Mexico recently. You and I were talking off the air and I discovered I couldn't even fully control my bowels. It's not something I want to talk about. But it's like all the willpower in the world doesn't mean squat, you know, pun intended, right? So it's the part we can control is what's going on inside of us. And that we can control what we focus on. We can control the meaning. We can decide the meaning. We're the meaning makers and we can decide what to do. And when we make those three decisions, we're in control of our life and all the anxiety and bullshit tends to go away, especially if we're trying to do that to serve something more than Ourselves. Not like you're so unselfish, you're not going to succeed because you can't serve something more than yourself and not benefit. So it's not like you're sacrificing. The people that play that game, it's not a sacrifice. It's like philanthropy. I hear people talk about, well, philanthropy, well, a friend of mine the other day was on an airplane and somebody was reading, I just thought, my book triggered me, it was Life Force. And a person was really into it. And he said, hey, what do you, he's known me for 45 years. And he says, what do you think of that book? Oh, it's incredible, the stem cells and this, you can't believe the breakthroughs. I don't know why we didn't know about this. What do you think of the author? Oh, he seems like a really good guy and he donated all the profits to feed people. Course, he's totally rich. So, I mean, it's easy when you're rich, right? And my buddy turns to him and he says, well, what if I told you that I knew him since he was 17 years old, 45 years ago, and that I remember when he had $20 to his name, there was a guy in the street And he gave him 10 bucks and told me that the time to give is when you don't have it. And he said, and I watched him build that all the way up there. He taught me that if you don't give a dime out of a dollar, you're not going to give a hundred million out of a billion. Right. And it's like, people look at things and they make their focus something like, oh, I'm sacrificing or I'm going to do philanthropy because, you know, I'm rich. No, you do philanthropy because it's a source of kindness and love. Philanthropy can be your attention. Philanthropy can be your time. Philanthropy can be a buck, five bucks. Philanthropy can be you're in line with people in Starbucks and you, you know, I remember doing this research, I couldn't believe it. If you buy five people who you don't know their coffee, you get a biochemical change that has a more lasting impact than most things you could purchase for yourself instead of including Large purchases. So it's like, it's intelligent selfishness is the truth. You can't possibly do good and not feel good. When you want some self-esteem, do something worthwhile beyond just yourself.
  Chris Williamson
  The reflective glow of doing something for everybody else is, yeah, it's an odd, it kind of makes it difficult to be selfless when you're actually thinking that way. The most selfish thing you can do is to be selfless. There is truly nothing that is particularly selfless in that way. Yeah, just dig in a little more for me.

- **Tony Robbins' Morning Routine**
  - Prime your nervous system with gratitude for 10 minutes each morning.
  - Focus on three things you're grateful for, then bless loved ones, and finally, visualize three goals as already achieved.
  Transcript:
  Tony Robbins
  Um, I don't, I don't know anybody good at not having any thoughts. Um, but I thought I want to prime myself. That's my goal. So I do a breathing pattern, like a, you know, breath of fire type of thing to change my physiology for just two minutes. And then I do three things and I do it for just 10 minutes because my view is if you don't have 10 minutes for your life, you don't have a life. And I want to prime myself so whatever comes into this world, I have the best chance of handling it really well. And I'm training my nervous system. What's the emotion I want to train? Gratitude. Why? We all know the two emotions that destroy your relationship, your business, your life, it's fear and anger. Those are the two extremes. You can't be grateful and fearful simultaneously. You can't be angry and grateful simultaneously. So what I do is I start my day, I make those changes, and I close my eyes or I look out at the water and I think of three things that I'm grateful for for just a minute each. But I don't think of it like over there, like if you've ever been on a roller coaster and I asked you what it's like, some people remembered it over there. No, I remember it like I'm in the front seat going over the edge because then you get the authentic biochemical changes. So I'm there. And I do two strong things. And usually one simple thing like the wind in my hair or my daughter's smile or something of that nature so I don't just get wired for own unbelievable things but that that primes that Nervous system and then the second thing I do is I take three minutes and it's kind of like a blessing or a prayer for the people around me for the people I love I start close I send it out there And there's been a lot of studies I'm sure you've read that Dalai Lama and others have done on compassion for strangers, what it does to your brain. And so I do it every day. And then the last three minutes, I call three to thrive, where I focus for a minute each on something I really want to make happen. But I don't sit there and pray for it, hope for it. It's like, I give thanks for it as it's done. I see it as done. I experience it as done. I wire my reticular activating system. I can speak in shorthand to you about this. So now it's going to notice anything that relates to that, but it has a joyous feeling to it as well. And I'm done in 10 minutes and ([Time 0:39:52](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a41e731d-6d34-4bfc-b593-7b34a4a3c65b))
- **Life's Four Seasons**
  - Human life can be viewed through the lens of four seasons: spring (0-21), summer (22-42), fall (43-63), and winter (63+).
  - Spring is a time of rapid growth and optimism, while summer presents tests and challenges that lead to growth.
  - Fall is the power phase where efforts from previous seasons yield results, and winter offers peace and fulfillment for those who have done the work.
  - Recognizing these seasons and anticipating the challenges and rewards of each phase can help individuals navigate life with greater awareness and purpose.
  - Understanding life's cyclical nature can reduce fear and anxiety by providing a framework for interpreting experiences.
  Transcript:
  Chris Williamson
  No, I know it's not good. The outcomes are really, really, really not good.
  Tony Robbins
  Well, you can predict that. You don't have the brilliant scientists to figure that, right? A decade ago, a bit of human intuition would have taught you that. Yeah. But the point is, they said, what's being done? He goes, well, we think it's going to take a lot longer. It'll be fine. I mean, it's not. So how do you arm yourself or your kids for a world of such change? You have to learn rapidly. And so you need three skills. You need skill number one, to be able to really recognize patterns. You're very good at that. I'm not throwing stuff your way. I watched a couple things you're doing and you do your homework and you recognize patterns, you utilize them, you recognize them in yourself. That's one thing I respect even more. And you use that to improve yourself, right? But when people are fearful, when they have anxiety, it's almost always because they don't recognize the patterns that are happening. Because if you recognize the patterns, things are very predictable. What looks like chaos is just because it's not been a pattern you've seen before. Like if you look at history as an example, it's like, this has never happened. You know, you heard people talk about, we've never been this divided as a country and all this stuff. It's such bullshit. And what am I saying? There was a civil war. What's that? There was a civil war. Yeah, there was a civil war, but there's a little sheet I brought down. Is it, do you have that little sheet? Can I borrow this? I'll just read you this because I thought it's entertaining. I showed this in an event theater today. This is two placards from a photograph of them or reconstruction of them from John Adams versus Thomas Jefferson. They're running for president, right? So let's see how divided they were. This placard says, if you elect Thomas Jefferson, murder, robbery, rape, incest, and adultery will be practiced throughout the land. Are you prepared to see your dwellings in flames, your female chastity violated, or your children writhing on the pike? This is what Adams wrote about Jefferson. It makes like Trump's Hitler sound pretty kind. You know, most John Adams says, or excuse me, Jefferson says about John Adams in the placard, it says, John Adams is busy importing mistresses from Europe or trying to marry one of his Sons to the daughter of King George. He's a hideous hermaphrodite character with neither the force or firmness of a man nor the gentleness and sensibility of a woman. These are our founding fathers, right? So it's like, you're so full of shit. Like when you say this has never happened before, it hasn't happened in your lifetime because the cycle, if you study a thousand years of Roman history, which I've done, 500 years of Anglo-American history, there's patterns that happen about every roughly 20 years and the patterns are predictable. So think about this. This is why you want to learn this. If you can recognize patterns, the fear disappears. Second skill, use the pattern. When you know what the pattern is and you use it, now you have mastery of something. Now you can do better than most people in that area. So, you know, I interview all these people, the best investors in the world, they're all different, but I recognize the patterns that are in common. And when I'm done, my billionaire clients love it. And the average person can learn from it because the patterns are fundamental, right? You, you, if I want to learn the piano in the beginning, I have to learn probably somebody else's patterns that have figured it out. That's how I learn. But if I use those patterns over and over again, I'll eventually get to where I can do the third skill, which is pattern creation. Now you have an amazing life. Now you're not managing your circumstances. You're the creator of your life, but you have to first recognize them so you're not in fear. And then here's an example. When did humanity transform from a fearful place as its primary base, where we were hunter gatherers, right? Where literally you had to move from place to place and you didn't know if you're going to eat or survive. What changed that to be a live in a community and grow a community, a city, a state, a country? One pattern recognition, seasons. The day that we figured out that if I do the right thing at the wrong time, I get nothing. But if I plant it this specific time in the spring, and if I know I got to protect it during the hot summer, I'm going to reap in the fall. And if I hang on to some of that, I'll make it through the next winter. That changed humanity completely. One recognition. And most of us don't have that recognition of the season. So here's a season for you and your audience to consider. What season are you in right now? Because human life has four seasons, if we want to call it that. As an oversimplification, zero to 21 is springtime. What do you know about springtime? Is it hard to grow during springtime? Things grow automatically in springtime. If you start a business in springtime, you're going to think you're the business genius. No, you're just in springtime. Everybody's optimistic. Things grow easily, Goes, goes, goes. It's an overall theme. It lasts about 17 to 20 years on average. And then we exhaust that emotion. It's like even good emotions get exhausted. Do you ever smile so much your face hurt? Right? So it's like, you need variety. So then we go into a different season. We go into the summer, which tests you. It's hard. It's more difficult. And then if you make it through that time, you get to reap. And if you make it through that time, you get to be tested again. So it's always, you know, we get easy times and tough times. Why is that important? Well, zero to 21 is your springtime. Some of us had to go work at seven or eight years old, but we're still protected. If there's a war, you didn't go to war, right? Someone fed you most of the time. You're primarily being poured into education, information. So it's a pretty easy time. Then you go 21, 22 to 42. That's your summer. That's your testing period. And I think that's the period that you're coming to the end of. And that testing period, by the way, all the studies show it's the most unhappy time in most people's life because you start out feeling you're invincible. You learned all this stuff and you're like, I don't know if I believe all this crap I was taught. I'm going to go, I'm going to do this myself. I'm going to be president of the United States, a multi-billionaire and have a hundred relationships simultaneously, and everyone's going to be happy. And you believe this shit, right?
