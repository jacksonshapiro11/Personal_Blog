  The biggest piece of overarching advice that I give is that you will not be the same person who you were one year ago. And that is all across the board. It's the way you use email. It's the way that you run a meeting. It's you know, your goals for yourself, what you believe your strengths and your weaknesses to be. And because all of my clients are running these companies that are changing so quickly, they never really get the footing of feeling like they're doing something really well for a long Period of time. And I think that's like one of the hard things about the founders. And I feel like you can really relate to this being a business owner is that you know, when you have a regular job, the better you get at that job, the easier the job becomes because you know How to do it. And with being a founder, I call it the reverse incentive learning curve where actually the better you get at your job, the harder your job becomes because you're just creating more Complexity for yourself. And so with my clients, I really say get used to it. It's going to always feel like the rug is getting pulled underneath you. And that's a good thing because if you ever feel like you know exactly what's going on and you've done it, then your company isn't growing any longer and you're not solving new challenges, Not pushing yourself. And so I'll really actively use that language them while I'll be like, okay, feels like we're moving into a new era. You know, this was you 1.0 now this is you 2.0 or 3.0 wherever we are. And so I do a lot of kind of reflecting about how they've grown where I'll say, hey, let's pause. Let's think about how you would have handled this a year ago versus now and get them to actively accept and acknowledge that they are these highly changeable creatures. And so this is actually what I'm writing my next book about. But my big thesis is that in this new world that we live in, IQ doesn't really matter. Of course, we have to clear some certain bar of intelligence, but what really matters is your ability to adapt and change, which I'm calling AQ. That's actually what matters. You know, I read somewhere that it used to be that people would have six jobs over the course of their lifetime. And now it's projected that Gen Z will have 15 jobs across five industries, you know, like they're going to change industries multiple times. They're going to live in multiple houses, different cities. ([Time 0:47:11](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ffc9d98c-2af3-4c77-a8b0-adcb1c29d22b))
    - **Note:** The new iq is adaptability and aq adapt grow or die.
