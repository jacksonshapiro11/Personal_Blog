### Highlights

- The Four Pillars of Four Seasons: Quality, Service, Culture, and Brand
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So much of long term success is based on intangibles, beliefs and ideas, invisible concepts. People often asked me about my original vision for four seasons. Well, the truth is there was no vision or a grand scheme. In 19 61, when i built my first hotel, i knew nothing about the hotel business. My only professional experience was in building apartments and houses. I was just a builder, and the hotel was just another real estate deal. I never thought that this was going to be a career, nor did i ever imagine i would one day find myself building and managing the largest and most prestigious group of five star hotels in the world. I approached the business of innkeeping from a customer's perspective. I was the host, and the customers were my house guests. I decided what to build and how to operate by asking myself, what would the customers consider important? What would the customers recognize as value? Because if we give them good value, they will pay what they think it's worth. That was the first strategy, and it continues to this day. The company evolved slowly at first, and i'll admit i made a few mistakes along the way, but i never made the mistake of putting profit ahead of people. Looking back over the last forty years, i have identified the four key strategic decisions that form the rock solid foundation of four seasons. They are now known as the four pillars of our business model. They are quality, service, culture and brand. Curiously, the last of these four key objectives was set way back in 19 86. ([Time 0:00:00](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6b94b4cc-8386-4f48-988f-1f14647b257f))
    - **Note:** The four pillars of the 4 seasons quality service culture brand. They have many quality’s over time and best practices but nothing reached this peak. There were a lot of things they did but their key point of differentiation was the foundational culture they built. Culture can not be mandated as a policy it grows from the many actions of the companies people. We become the people of the actions we continually take. We are what we continually do. Izzy sharpe was a dreamer always he saw no goals as out of his reach and dreamed big. Had a respect of those who put their principals above all else like those who volunteered for war. Strong commitment to his decision the only thing you can control is your attitude. He was happy to go against the grain or more agnostic to it. He was great at holding 2 separate ideas and synthesizing them. The best entrepreneurs are remixers.
- Growing Up Independent and Learning Construction Skills
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  That meant changing schools, as always on our own, and being trusted that we knew what to do, made us, i believe, independent at a very early age. So they can't afford to take vacations, as you can imagine. Slowly but surely, his dad builds up a smaller you know, they're not unbelievably poor. They have their own place to live. In fact, because they couldn't find up, they had no money to rent, like a vacation cottage, which was very common at this time. They decide to buy, to build their own. And izzie has to help his dad, and i think it's two or three other people a do this. And it only takes me a few weeks of really hard work. But i found this was interesting, and i'll read this part to you. We worked from dawn to dusk on sunday as well. After six such week ends, dad presented my mother with a cottage. From my early teens, construction became very much a part of my life. I'd often get up with the sun during summer holidays, go o my dad's then current sight, and work until dusk. And so in this point in the book, he's reflecting back on all the lessons. And a lot of times his father would teach him lessons without having to say a word. And really, the summary of the next section, ie cn, read, to his experience, is the best teacher. And we see his, his father's preferred teaching method. A dad too taught me in his own inimitable way. I was building two steps for a house, making wooden forms that were that were gong to be filled with concrete. Dad, who was watching, never told me i was building them wrong. And it wasn't until i had poured the concrete that i saw my mistake. ([Time 0:10:04](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7ef8d3ea-7cb6-4a0d-b0a4-b6961ed81f16))
    - **Note:** His parents were very poor and they endowed their kids with supreme agency allowing them to figure everything out for themselves and failing a lot. As Pre schoolers they told them to find their way to school. From a young age he was around construction and when he was laying concrete his dad let him fuck up told him it was wrong and to break it try again. His dad was incredibly kind. To swim his dad threw him off a boat and said then swim. He was born in Auswitz. His dad basically forced him to figure everything out for himself and this gave him a great agency. He went to a bank for financing and the banker saw his business mind and suggested Izzy move into management. Develop a personal philosophy when you’re young and live that every day. Most people don’t create this and go through life blind. He was extreme thoughtful in a common sense not intellectual way.
- Inordinate care, instead of having milk delivered, she would walk with the kids to the store and buy milk by the judge, which gave her one quart free
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Inordirate care, instead of having milk delivered, she would walk with the kids to the store and buy milk by the judge, which gave her one quart free. It was five years before we could afford our first vacation, which was three days of sunlight and sunburn at the midtown motor inn in niagara falls, which we then considered glamorous. So he continues giving us an up datum of his station in life. At this point, three children, a couple still in dipers in an apartment with only two bedrooms. Our situation was not only a drain on income, but on time. I was working morning till night, six or seven days a week. Rosalie never complained, never tried to change me. Though she once left me a note so succinctly pertinent that i still keep the original in my notebook. And this was very interesting what she wrote to him at this point. Oh, remember, he she's calling him an over achiever. She knows that his ambiion, i right at this point in his life, is his self belief and his ambition far outstrip what he's able to actually accomplish in real life yet. And that's ta main theme of his life, belief comes first. Over achievers suffer loss of intimacy, no time for fun relationships, starve on a diet of self absorption. Home is the place to express the playful part of oneself. That's the end of her note. ([Time 0:16:54](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4a691f31-a428-40ee-8b42-2a4492c3a6d6))
    - **Note:** He had to believe before he became anything. Belief comes before achievement. He didn’t vacation for 5 years and worked 6-7 days a week. Thought a mediocre business could make money so what could a great business do. He was always thinking about work and business. He had the idea of building a motel and went to many people who all told him no. He worked a guy for 3 years before he gave in and said he would give him half. Izzy never felt bad about and always asked for help. This was vital in his building and learning about hotels. Similar to Steve Jobs finding bill hewlets number in the phone book and asking him for parts to build a frequency counter. This lead to him getting a job at hp at 13. Most people don’t pick up the phone and ask that separates those who do a dream you gotta act and be willing to fail. Just keep getting up.
- Building a Second Hotel Against All Odds
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I was still primarily a builder, constructing houses and apartments. But even before four seasons success, rationalized my desire to build a second hotel. I was seeking a suitable site for building another one. I recognized the drawbacks while envisioning the possibilities, which created a subconscious belief in success. I liked it. And that subconscious belief that he's liking, that's being instilled in him, i causes him to go all in. And he risks. He risks everything. On the second hotel, i decided to go ahead. I foresaw only one difficulty, but it loomed large. How do you build a 200 room resort without an money? This was a literal fact. My earnings barely covered my rising family costs. To build, i would have to leverage the entire 100 %. If the hotel should not prove successful, a loss so great, i could be in the debt for the rest, i could be in debt for the rest of my life. And it's during this construction of the second hotel that we really start to see his very simple perating system. I feel we've talked about over and over again the last few pocket podcasts. And hees an entire booka the bonus up, as i just did on the amazons process of building new products, called working backwards, is e's doing the exact same thing. It does not it could all be so simple that it does not mean simple, does not mean easy. ([Time 0:26:24](https://share.snipd.com/snip/65c0069e-bfe2-458c-9533-7a03b8c58dd1))
    - **Note:** He starts by believing and goes for broke doing something he didn’t really understand and he hadn’t had massive success in and this became four seasons belief comes first. He started with making the customer happy simple first principles. He was focused on building for things that would never change people wanted a nice bed and good shower. He developed a lot of best practices on the fly. Tested many mattresses and shower heads. He put detail into what mattered but was often overlooked like towels. Start with ideal customer experience and solve customer problems. They invented the idea of non smoking floors. He had the first in hotel gym. His hotel was counter positioned and very differentiated. He was congratulated on his success which couldn’t have been more premature. Izzy flew to London for 4 years to close a hotel he was told could fail and London didn’t need another 5 star hotel but he focused just on the peak not trying to run 3-4 stars. He would barbell his hotel stays he needed to stay in the best of the best but because of costs he needed to barbell this with the worst of the worst to balance costs. Shop his competitors and market insight.
- "Belief Comes Before Ability": Building Trustworthy Relationships and Taking on Impossible Projects
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Gerald, sir gerald, how could you have trusted me with such animportant project when you knew if things didn't work out, i couldn't have covered my obligation? My dear boy? He said, over time, you make a judgment about people, you develop a belief and a trust. Those many meetings of ours were not primarily about business per se. They were about the foundation of business, trustworthy relationships. This is something i've long believed without giving im much thought. But from then on, in every deal, it would be in the forefront of my mind. Agastus moved on to his next big deal. Had again, a main theme of his his life story, is that belief comes before ability. I was also deeply involved in another project, one that seems incredible looking back, for i can't believe my huzpa in embarking on the idea of creating a hotel in toronto five times bigger than our hotel in london. So the city of toronto is building a new city hall, and they asked af requet for proposals about building this beautiful, giant hotel next to it. And he seized the opportunity. Says they called for tenders to build upon it a first class hotel that an elegance in size would harmonize with the new city hall. This would be one of the world's great hotels. And i don't know why i thought i could build it. I had neither the experience nor the money such a hotel required. So the wins af bidding on it loses out. ([Time 0:35:49](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7ba148a7-067a-471d-b06f-22b8f484c1c3))
    - **Note:** In his many trips to London he built a relationship and an old rich financier who backed him asked him why which he told him the years of meetings built the trust to back him even though Izzy couldn’t meet his obligations if he failed. Izzy built a hotel 5x bigger than his London one just because he believed. Hutzpsh was his Keri to success many times. He got an offer from the most success tech company at his time to buy him out for 2mm he had 2 hotels he said no he was only interested in partnership they offered to merge and pay him whatever he wanted when he had almost nothing but he again said no. He was overwhelmed and just sat at a desk thinking for hours about what he wanted to do quietly. He made a list of pros and cons and knew what to do. He valued freedom too much and couldn’t sell. He needed independence. When the big hotel he partnered on started to skip in standards he sold his stake for 5x more. All business starts wiry beliefs trying to run a company without belief is like steering a ship without a rudder.
- The Last Days with Chris
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And i answered, we hope you recover, but it's possible you may not. No one knows for sure. Once i said to him, there can't be a god and he answered, don't say that there is a god. Those were black days and black nights. I remember going up the stairs so heavily with nothing but dread in each step. The night before chris died, the rest of us ate chicken dinner in his bedroom. We were chatting normally, hoping to make him feel included. He didn't speak. He just lay there quietly, very still, looking at the ceiling. I marvelled at that stillness that he had maintained during the three months he was bedridden, graceful and easy in his body, never a twitch of anxiety. That last night, he was wearing sn glasses, which he had asked for before dinner. He was removing himself the way people do when they are ready to leave the world. The next morning, friday, march tenth, 19 78, chris said, dad, don't go to work to day. Izzie stood by his bed and i lay across the bed, and each of us held one of his big, beautiful hands. ([Time 0:46:25](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7cd8821d-e8a2-4b19-892d-8b38822b64d5))
    - **Note:** His son who wanted to follow him into hotels died young of skin cancer. Immense pain. He never got over this loss and never saw his son as dead. Some kid ran 26 miles a day dying of cancer with 1 leg and heart problems to raise awareness were much stronger than we believe. He got over levered and realized he needed to refocus on what he wanted his life’s work to be and decided that he wanted to get into only management of great hotels. His partners thought he was crazy but that’s what he wanted to be his life’s work.
- Learn from McDonald's: Copy the How, Not the What
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  He gets pushed back from some of his executives. He says, the next day, i told our senior, our senior headquarters people, i want you to come with me to macdonalds and see how they train their people for service. One of them said, look, they're selling hamburgers and we're selling filet mignon. How can you even compare it? I know what we're selling. I said, i'm talking about how we sell it. And this is something i feel, meand you have been talking about a lot the last few weeks. Don't copy the what. Copy the how thitse isiest saying that exact same thing. Let's, let's go back to what we learne in the book, working backwards. Basos didn't make another ipod when he had that meeting with steve jobs. He didn't copy the what. He copied the how. Steve jobs strategy for the ipod. And itunes. Bazos copied the strategy to make the kindle. He didn't make the ipod. He took the idea behind the how, not the what. That is so powerful. Don't copy the what. Copy the how, because those ideas transferd to any discipline. This is soeting. We ought to learn from coby bryan, among others. It's so smart what he's picking up here. He's continuen to having these discussions with these executives, and he's talking about, he says something right here, and i'm just going o read to you its. He repeats overnver again at variations of this, we're only what we do, not what we say we are. And something in my own personl maxim that i use in my life is, actions express priority. ([Time 1:00:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ce116faf-41ec-4b67-8312-ebeda0030603))
    - **Note:** He went to hamburger university to learn the how of McDonald’s service. It’s not about the what but the how. He wanted to learn the principles of great service. Actions express priorities. Focused menically on superior service. He needed leather not vynl insisting people would know the difference. Walt Disney leather straps on carriages or Steve Jobs inner beauty of iPhones. Actions spoke louder than words. He needed to feel about service how Ray Kroc felt about hamburgers they took it more seriously than the competition. Insanely high bar for quality throughout the organization which was tough but essential to uphold. Better right have no values than ti not live up to them. Wanted to focus on one thing doing too much at once leads to failure. If quality is your edge you can’t compromise it.
- Bill Gates and Saudi Prince: Majority Owners of Four Seasons
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  It's strange, but i can't recall being deeply concerned, perhaps because of my depth of involvement and belief in what i was doing. Interesting enough, something t a i learned while reading this book that was actually surprising is, so four seasons wines ut being a public company, but then is taken private towards the end of his career. He winds up selling majority ownership. Since two thousand six i think, bill gates and a saudy prince have been the majority owners of four seasons, and four seasons is private. Now, i was very surprised when i got to that part of the book. A, it's the great quote. And then he's got this idea of invisible automatic service. Excellent. This greatt first excellence is often just a capacity for taking pains. And this is what i mean about invisible automatic service. He comes up with one of the first companies to actually track, like the use the computer to track what the preferences of their customers and then just deliver to them without asking, without them having to asked for it. We made this a common experience by setting up, early on, far ahead of other hotel companies, what we called a guess history system. The first time guests stayed with us, we computerized their preferences in rooms, food, drink and anything else our employees noted, so that when they returned, we could give them, without them having to ask, hatever they wanted and liked best. Then he's continuing to rethink the experience that he has for customers. ([Time 1:07:47](https://share.snipd.com/snip/29633b4a-9f3b-4ef2-ab09-b94e0f051326))
    - **Note:** Excellence is the capacity to take pain. He took a loan out on all of his stock when the company was struggling to keep it alive instead of selling for a great profit. They digitized all customer preferences first. Most businesses are poorly run just do the right things in the right way and you’ll get a ton of headway. Do the right thing in the right way. He took a page out of ritz book and partnered with first class chefs to reinvent hotel dining. Shop competitors. He didn’t want to grow to grow but wanted to do it the right way. Growth for growth sake kills companies when you lose your promise. His dad drilled into him how important people were in bushisss and his dad was one of the kindest positive people he lnew. Hired field laborers and taught them easier to learn good habits than to unlearn a career of bad ones. They greatly appreciated the work. In recessions people cut advertising but this kills momentum which it’s tough to restart better to keep the flywheel moving. Those who don’t cut spending in downturns monetize up cycles
- The Only Competitive Advantage: A Barrier to Entry
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Underlying and justifying my view of the future was what warrn buffet, the world's most successful investor, in his latest year end discourse, has called the only competitive advantage that matters, a barrier to entry. This was what i believed our competitive advantage now provided. Our portfolio of hotels was the largest group of authenticly first class hotels in the world, a physical product no other company had to the same degree. These were exceptional assets, almost impossible to duplicate. And that is where i'll leave it for the full story. If you buy the book, using the link that's in the show notes, in your pocket player, you'll be supporting the podcast at the same time. I also leave a link in the show notes. If you want to buy a friend or a co worker a gift subscription to founders, you'll be supporting nonyo, your friend, i feel i's goong to do smething nice for smebody else. But you're also supporting the podcast. It's because so many people have been doing this lately. Not only they've been buying gift subscriptions, but they've been telling people about the podcast i've spent, i've be having been able to spend less time on marketing and more time reading and making podcasts. That's why my i've, you'll see, ike, i've been releasing podcasts more frequently. I guess i should tell you about this. I don't really think i've told you this efore. I think of founders mores like it's a course on the history of unch pinership. It's one giant discussion on all the best and worst ideas from the history of unch pinership.

  It's one giant discussion on all the best and worst ideas from the history of unch pinership. I do not think of it as a show. That's why i don't have ads, i don't have inch or music, i don't have interviews. And its what i realize that i want to get away from anything that is show like and just releasing podcasts on the same day every week, like sometimes have it finished for a few days, ndas i go, i got to release it on a sunday, because that's what shows do. And i was like, david, this isn't a show. Why? Why am i holding this? If it's ready? Why don't i just release it? The the sooner you get this information in your mind, the more time you have to apply these lessons to your own career. So this, this line of thinking, the reason i would encourage you, if you can, and if you know anybody that wants to, if you do, buy gift prescriptions for other people.
