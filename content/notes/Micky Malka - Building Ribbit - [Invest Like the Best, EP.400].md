### Highlights

- **The Grid**
  Micky Malka introduces the concept of "the grid," encompassing the interconnectedness of data (internet), wealth (finance), and power (energy). These are converging for the first time in history. Now you have agents tokenizing money. Crypto rails and decentralized electric being combinded to create power law effects. Where is the world going. Identity and wealth combo is key.

  And I think the grid concept, the sort of global digital grid is something that you're focused very carefully on today. Can you just describe how you came to this idea and what you mean by it?
  Micky Malka
  The grid is our version of the matrix, of that interconnectivity of different aspects that make us who we are and how we transact and live in this world. And you could think about the grid as, if you think about the internet, it's a grid of itself. It's a grid full of data and knowledge. If you think about money and wealth, there's been grids for the last 50 years that allow you to move money in real time, in delay time, in slow times. You got Visa networks, MasterCard, PetWires, ACH, UPI, PIX. They're all financial design grids. And then if you think about electricity, we think about the electric grid and we think about towers and power meters and transformers and high voltage and all of those things. What will happen if you actually thought that they were all combined into one? They actually need each other. There is no knowledge grid without power and there is no power without money. If you combine them all together and you think about them as just one single grid that has to connect all of these things at the same time, it's quite rare and unique because it hasn't happened In a long time. These grids have been independent forever. The financial grid has been independent for five, 600 years. The internet, the data grid has been independent for 25 years. The electric grid has been evolving for just 140 years. But now we hit a moment in time when the three of them are converging in a way that we have not seen in almost 500 years. And the last time we seen that was probably in the late 14, 1500s with the printing press. What people have to understand is that the printing press by itself was not the event. The printing press, what it did was it allowed you to print all the knowledge that was written three, 400 years, thousands of years before that. The same way AI right now is the printing press moment, but it's only possible because we have digitized every single piece of content for the last 30 years. So what took hundreds of years of human scriptures to write history and contents back then for the printing press to print has taken 35 years now or 40 years to digitize. So now the AI engines can actually work on it and tokenize. And so you have knowledge in ways that we've never have been tokenized. You have money getting tokenized in ways that we've never think from crypto rails, token existing rails, to the way all of these aspects of smart contracts are working. And you have electrons, which are becoming more and more decentralized, which are power all of those at the same time. So this moment is probably the most interesting moment of the last hundred years in terms of the opportunity sets that is going to come from it. So when you take those things and you put them all together, you say, okay, what does it mean? It means that knowledge, money, and power are interconnected in ways that allows you to create use cases that we've never seen. AI agents are going to need access to money. AI agents are going to need access to the crypto rails to do that. So when we think about the grid as a concept, we look at it and say, oh my God, how do we invest into this? How do we think about if you buy that vision of the world, which we have bought ourselves into, and then you start to ask a question, how do you deploy capital in it? How do you think about the opportunity sets? What needs to come first? What needs to come second? What are the use cases that we should expect to see in 10 years, in five years, in one year that will show that this is going the right direction? That's what we mean with the grid. It's probably the most exciting opportunity set that I've seen in my life.
  Patrick O’Shaughnessy
  How do you dig into aspects of that? I mean, it seems correct that everything you just laid out means that the world is already different and changing so quickly around these dimensions. How do you go from that insight down to tangible opportunity?
  Micky Malka
  So I don't have a great answer. No light bulb that I can tell you, hey, this is what we're doing. But there's always a but. First, you go from the macro and then you look at the micro. The most smaller aspect where I can see this happening, it's actually in art. So to me, artists are artists because they're always ahead of society. In many ways, artists always tell you where the world is going. That's what they did. The best sci-fi films when we were kids shaped where we are going. Mars. The way we think about lens. I was talking to Matt Vaughn the other day with The Kingsman. He was saying, I had the meta lenses on my movies 10 years ago. Like all of these things, they'll tell you where these things are going. And if you follow art today and you see how they're using all of those aspects at the same time, you're seeing artists using AI in different ways than the Silicon Valley engineers are Using it. You're seeing how they are using NFTs as a method of distribution, of ownership. People will read in the media, NFTs are dead. I think they're wrong. When you really look at how artists are using it, it's just different. And the way they're using power and knowledge to express dynamic aspects of the world. So if they can do it in art and they can express it visually like that, where will it take off in businesses? So then we sort of peel that and say, OK, what next? What are the first variables that we need? Do we need to figure out identity? Is identity a big component of society solving a lot of these things? Because right now we have ideas, but we don't have an identity that allows us to connect our knowledge to ourselves, ourselves to our money, ourselves to the grid. So can we go and find stuff happening there? Can we find the grid on financial services that will be decentralized? What will be the way it will operate? How will AI agents speak on your behalf and move money on your behalf and sign contracts? Because a piece of NFT, a piece of art that lies on NFT, it's a smart contract. Now imagine an AI agent using that on your behalf to do something. What would it look like? So when you start to go down that path, we try to figure it out? What are the use cases?
  Patrick O’Shaughnessy
  It's funny that we're having this conversation behind us is this piece of art that is radically changing on the fly, generative art based on what we're saying. So literally, it's so fun for me to have this conversation literally behind you. I can see the topics visually on the screen in this remarkable way. And it does feel sort of like seeing the future. It does feel like everything is going to be a version of this ([Time 0:26:14](https://share.snipd.com/snip/287d4174-efca-47d2-baea-9c7c2cb0f6d4))
