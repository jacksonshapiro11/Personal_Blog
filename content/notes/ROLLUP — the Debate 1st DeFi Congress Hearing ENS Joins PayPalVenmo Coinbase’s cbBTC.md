- Constitutional Rights Demand Anonymity in Finance
  Summary:
  Government intervention is necessary to protect individuals, especially against the misuse of financial instruments by the wealthy.
  The reliance on decentralized finance (DeFi) for tax evasion is exaggerated, as it is an ineffective means for billionaires to avoid taxes. Critics highlight the volatile, scam-laden nature of the crypto and DeFi industries, emphasizing the need for current security laws to apply uniformly across these sectors.
  Anonymity in financial transactions is framed as a constitutional right, rooted in historical struggles for civil liberties.
  Overreach through surveillance measures like the Bank Secrecy Act is criticized as unconstitutional and a threat to fundamental rights.
  Advocacy for de facto rights to peer-to-peer commerce is essential, calling for a reevaluation of perceptions towards privacy in financial dealings as a matter of civil liberties rather than a support for illicit activities.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  The government has to step in and help protect people. That was her point. Brad Sherman was caught up on this idea that only like tax evaders are billionaires. The billionaire class is rampantly using DeFi to avoid paying taxes. I think they have lots of ways to avoid paying taxes.
  Speaker 2
  Completely unfounded.
  Speaker 1
  I don't think any of them involve DeFi. Like DeFi is just like not a good way to avoid paying taxes.
  Speaker 2
  DeFi is such a terrible way to paying taxes.
  Speaker 1
  So there's that. And then of course they brought in their kind of key witnesses, the opposition did, one of which was an analyst at the Americans for Financial Reform. His name was Mark Hayes. And he basically said this is a quote, crypto and DeFi industries is highly volatile, scam laden, and extremely predatory, which exposes investors to substantial financial losses. And he also believed that the current security law paradigm should totally apply to DeFi in the exact same way.
  Speaker 2
  Another person who did just a bang up job, Peter van Valkenburg from Coin Center, who I think you and I truly appreciate Peter because he makes the right points, but he connects it to American History. Hell yeah. And this really just like precise sharp way. And of course he delivered just beautifully here. So let's go ahead and listen to Peter.
  Speaker 1
  So what member Foster suggested where the problem with anonymity is that we don't have a hundred percent identification and control over financial transactions in the economy, I Don't think we'll have 100% identity and control over DeFi transactions. And I think we will have robust anonymity, and that's an American constitutional right. So you have a constitutional right to anonymous transactions that support organizations and causes that defend against discrimination and violations of our constitutional rights. We fought about this during the Civil Rights Movement in the 1970s. As Thurgood Marshall said with respect to the Bank Secrecy Act, the law that actually requires financial surveillance of custodial intermediaries, though not non-custodial intermediaries, Marshall dissented from the constitutionality of even that level of surveillance. He said, the fact that some may use negotiable instruments for illegal purposes cannot justify the government's running roughshod over the First Amendment rights of the hundreds Of lawful yet controversial organizations like the ACLU. Congress may well be correct in concluding that law enforcement would be facilitated by the dragnet requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act, but those who wrote our Constitution recognized More important values. Hell, yeah, go Peter. More important values. Yeah. God, it just sends goosebumps down my arm. It's just so good. Imagine somebody in Congress saying, guys, you actually don't have the constitutional right to financially surveil all of your citizens. The Bank Secrecy Act.
  Speaker 2
  No, you can't do that.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah. The Bank Secrecy Act was probably unconstitutional, he says. But beyond that, how are you now trying to expand the Bank Secrecy Act to all peer-to transactions? That's clearly a breach of the Constitution, like bringing it back to the basics here. And it shouldn't be up to defy to defend itself. I mean, we should be saying like we have a right default de facto under the constitution to be able to do peer to peer commerce.
  Speaker 2
  It was pretty cool to see friend of the pod, our favorite status, retweets this, this speech from Peter who says this is the correct position. And it's really embarrassing that an unforced error, how many liberals and center left people have embraced propaganda to the point of dismissing payments anonymity as something Of bad or pro-crypto coded, rather than the obvious defense of civil liberties than it is.
  Speaker 1
  I love Rowan. I love Rowan. Do you really? I disagree with him on so many things, so many things. But I appreciate his consistency. But on privacy.
  Speaker 2
  On privacy. We are 100% aligned.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, 100% aligned except with respect to the tactics because Ron Gray somehow thinks like you can just pass legislation and suddenly the government will give us privacy. We'll just build a CBDC that gives you privacy. Yeah, I disagree with that. We could pass that in Congress. Yeah, anyway. Yeah, so I do agree. He's right there. So how would you kind of summarize this? ([Time 0:22:04](https://share.snipd.com/snip/af54e4e2-cda1-4697-89c4-5f9f9294e590))
