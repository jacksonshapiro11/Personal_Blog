### Highlights

- **Bubbles as Coordination Mechanisms**
  - Economic bubbles, while often destructive for individuals, can accelerate technological advancements that benefit society as a whole.
  - Bubbles act as a powerful coordinating force, signaling to entrepreneurs and investors where to direct their resources and efforts.
  - This coordination creates positive feedback loops, where bets on emerging technologies become less risky due to the collective belief in their potential, driving rapid progress that wouldn't be possible during slower growth.
  - Bubbles essentially create clusters in time encouraging individuals with relevant skills to contribute at the optimal moment and pushing innovation forward.
  - Bubbles are driven by more than FOMO, they can invoke a legitimate fear of missing out on the opportunity to contribute to a pivotal moment in technological advancement.

  You have these really rich people who invest a ton of money in some project or set of projects, and they do lose a lot of their money, but things get built. So look at, say, railroad bubbles in the 19th century. A lot of people lost a lot of money speculating railroad stocks. But the U.S. Has a really, really good freight rail network. It is very, very cheap. If you're transporting things over land, if you can transport them along railroad, you are paying a fraction of the cost of transporting them on a truck. And trucks are also pretty efficient. So, you know, it's a big deal. The UK similarly had a very well-developed railroad network, and that ended up being a nice subsidy to their industrialization. So they had railway bubbles in a smallish one in the 30s that felt like a big one at the time, and then a really big one in the 1840s. And that one, you know, they were investing a substantial chunk of GDP. Like, I think it was like single-digit chunk of GDP each year in just building new railways. And what that meant was, as their economy further industrialized, as they were importing more raw materials from the rest of the world and manufacturing them, building finished goods Domestically, and then shipping those to the rest of the world again to keep their trade system in balance, having an internal system of railroads was actually a really, really good Way to have an efficient manufacturing footprint within that country. You could get the coal where it needs to be. You could get equipment where it needs to be. You could get the iron to the steel mill. You could get the steel to the factory that's turning it into whatever the end product is. This all ended up being really valuable. But when you think about that, okay, so maybe just from the perspective of minimizing long-term economic inequality, maybe having these periodic booms where the bust tends to hit The richest people a little bit harder because they just have more money to lose and then the infrastructure is beneficial to everybody. Maybe that's good. On the other hand, if the infrastructure would have gotten built anyway and we were just really in a rush, we built it really fast, we were kind of sloppy, we didn't know exactly which Cities needed railroad connections, so we just threw them out wherever we could. And sometimes that leads to a new city coming into existence, like Omaha, pretty much a creation of railroads. But sometimes it just leads to a railroad to nowhere, where we dug up all that iron and dug up all that coal and chopped down all those trees and built this thing. And a lot of people worked really hard, and some of them probably died in theth century, workplace safety was not quite up to modern standards. And yeah, then we ended up with just a railroad to nowhere. So maybe that was pointless. Maybe we should have done a slow roll on this. But then what we talk about in the book is, no, there are actually some things where they don't just get built sooner because there was a bubble. The only reason they exist was a bubble. The only reason that they exist was that for a brief period in time, so many people were so confident about some very specific change in the way the world works, some deployment of particular Technologies or changes in organizational structure. They were so confident in this that everyone knew that if they make a bet that only makes sense if this actually happens, that bet has a much higher chance of paying off, but only if you Make that bet right now. So look at AI right now.

  A zero to one bet.

  So AI right now is a fantastic example where NVIDIA is improving their chips at a very, very rapid pace. And it would be completely irresponsible for them if there weren't a use case, if they're just hoping that, hey, someone out there will create a game that is so demanding on graphics That no matter how powerful our GPU is, there will be demand for it, that would be a little bit irresponsible. But in this case, they know that there's basically a market for flops and that if they build more efficient GPUs, there's absolutely demand for them. And then at the labs, what do they think? They think, well, this model, like the scale of the model we're considering is so absolutely vast, it's just completely computationally infeasible. Like if you described the amount of compute that is needed to train, say, Llama 3.1, if you had described that to someone 20 years ago, you would have been explaining to them why AI will Never happen. It just requires a wildly unrealistic amount of compute. But of course, we know that that amount of compute is actually realistic because of NVIDIA's efforts. So each side is basically coasting on the assumption that, you know, coasting in a pretty aggressive way, but they're coasting on the assumption that the other side is actually going To build the thing that makes the thing they're building worthwhile. And so you can have this equilibrium where, you know, Blackwell doesn't get built or doesn't get built for a really long time and where Llama 3.1 does not get built or does not get built For a really long time, but probably just doesn't get built at all. Like that's one stable equilibrium. And the other equilibrium is they both get built and neither would really exist without the demand entailed by the other. So when you have a situation like that, like you can basically radically advance along one branch of the tech tree. And what you're really trying to do is figure out, OK, what are the real world fundamental limitations? So maybe the limitation is you can train really, really powerful AI models until you run out of good, fresh data, like high quality tokens. And once you hit that point, maybe you can't train anymore. But we didn't have any way of even speculating about that until we started actually making the big bets. And I don't know for sure that that is the case. I think there are some interesting things going on with synthetic data right now that can maybe not completely demolish the data wall, but maybe help us gradually scale it. But that is the general model, is that when you have a boom, you have a lot of capital flowing into a given sector, and it's based on a specific vision of what could be different, then everyone Who is working on some subproject within that, it's actually a less risky project conditional on everyone else taking big risks. Which is just, it's a really cool thing to think about. It means that bubbles are a coordination mechanism. They are a way to tell people that this is the thing to work on. This is where to apply your skills. And also kind of like one, another way that we like to think about it. And we talk a little bit about this in the book is there's this idea of industry clusters where there are particular cities you should be in if you want to be in a particular field. So if you want to work in finance, it's a really good idea to be in New York. If you want to get into movies, you probably want to go to LA. Like if your dream is to work in this industry, you don't want to work in like the third or fourth or fifth best city. Likeies do get made in Atlanta, but it's probably not a great idea to bet everything on your film career by moving to Atlanta and getting an office j...

- **Risk and Reward in Career Paths**
  * Big companies offer lower risk but also limited upside, capturing much of the increased worker output they generate.
  * This stability appeals to those who prioritize security over potential wealth.
  * High-risk ventures like startups and crypto attract those willing to gamble for exponential gains, even if the average outcome is less impressive.
  * Evaluating risk involves considering who benefits from the transaction and examining the full range of potential outcomes, not just the most desirable one.
  * True risk assessment requires understanding if the day-to-day experience is rewarding, regardless of the final outcome.
  * Risk changes and the old thing doesn’t always preserve upside so you need to constantly think for yourself

  It actually, one of the things it means is that you can hire people and tell them that your job right now is pretty boring. You're an individual contributor, but our headcount is only going up and the responsibilities are only growing in magnitude and the complexity of our process, it's only going to get More complex over time. So there's room for you as just, you know, the new hire on the Ford assembly line, there's actually room for you to move up within the company. Ford is going to get bigger and what we do is going to get more complicated and what we do is going to get more lucrative. And so you actually have some upside. It's not just you have a job, that's your job, and one day you will die or just be too sick to work. It's like you have a job, but maybe in five years you're supervising a bunch of people with your old job. And maybe in 10 years you're designing processes for all the supervisors, and maybe in 20 or 30 or 40 years you're actually running the company. So very different kind of value proposition for the entire question of do I work for a company, or do I stay home on the family farm, or do I start my own little independent shop doing something? And so getting all of those social changes worked through society, like getting it to the point where parents actually have good advice for their kids and can tell them here are the perks Of working for a big company, here are the perks of working for a small company, here are the perks of starting your own thing. That takes a lot of time. And that is part of that productivity growth. Because part of that productivity growth is just matching people to the right opportunities and adapting that matching process to changes in the scope of those opportunities and Changes and how well we understand them. And so you had talked earlier about this idea of crypto people don't want to follow this standard path of you go to the right schools, you take the right tests, you get the right job, everyone Knows it's the right job, and you just follow this track until you're done. For one thing, those tracks, they're always based on a previous generation's experience of what went well. So they always tend to overshoot, they over-index on basically whatever the best jobs were when your parents were first getting a job. And sometimes those things change kind of slowly, but sometimes they change pretty fast and it's a little bit disorienting. I think if you step outside of that and you say that whenever there's an obvious path and whenever it's a low risk path, the aggregate risk in the economy hasn't gone down because of the Existence of big companies. The way that risk is experienced has changed. And sometimes what happens is big companies will riff on a different Tyler Cowen book. Tyler Cowen wrote this book called Big Business, and it is all about how big companies are actually pretty great. And he makes the point that they are more law-abiding because they just have more at-risk. Like if a mom-and store, I don't know, doesn't pay someone overtime, just pays them their usual hourly wage, like that's not front-page news. But if a Walmart manager somewhere in the vast Walmart ecosystem decides to pull a trick like that. The headline is not, you know, Bob who manages a store out there in Oregon underpaid one guy by $30 this shift. No, the actual story is Walmart, big company you know and love, is mistreating its workers. It's cheating them. So the company is just, they have more at risk if they violate the rules. So they tend to be a little bit more sticklers for those rules. And they do just get more output out of each worker. So when you work for a big company, you are producing more output per hour on average than you would if you were at a small company. And the company has kind of set itself up so that it captures a lot of the upside from that. And it gives you a low risk slice of the returns, but it is also truncating some of your personal upside. And for a lot of people, that's a perfectly good deal. I think for a lot of people, there's no question of if I could have some chance of 10xing my net worth and also some chance of having to sleep on a friend's couch, because I literally can't Pay rent anywhere. A lot of people would say, no, I don't want to take this bet. This is a bad bet. I'm less excited by the prospect of great wealth than I am just appalled by the prospect of losing everything. And then a lot of people who are perfectly willing to take that bet, yeah, they end up in crypto. They end up starting companies. They end up doing other high-risk stuff. So, like, the amount of risk does tend to get preserved in the economy over long periods, but it does get shifted around. You always want to ask with those low-risk, like one, are you giving up a lot of upside? But two, have you traded the short term lumpiness of sometimes you like for me, I write a newsletter and do a lot of other stuff, investing in other stuff. But like, let's say I'm considering, do I write my own newsletter? Or do I work for a big media company writing a newsletter for them? One way to think about that risk is I can't really get fired from my newsletter. I get a little fractionally fired every single day because people are constantly unsubscribing, resubscribing, et cetera. But there's no circumstance in which I'd suddenly lose all of my income. But it's entirely possible for a newsletter to get laid off at a big company. And they don't really have visibility into that. Sometimes it is a strategy change that happens many steps away in the org chart. You have no visibility into it. You're doing your job just fine. You're still creating wealth for the company. Maybe there's some internal political power struggle and someone, you happen to be a pawn who gets sacrificed as part of that. You still have risk, and the risk is just harder to underwrite in that case. So yeah, there's a lot of things to think about with just proper attitudes towards risk. And I think the really proper meta attitude towards risk is to always ask, who's on the other side of this transaction? What are they benefiting from when they transact with me? And am I looking at the full distribution or am I looking at the narrow slice of the distribution that makes this particular opportunity seem more promising and more fruitful? And of course, risk-seeking people have exactly the same problem. If you look at the people who go to Y Combinator, very, very few of them say, my dream is to do a strategic exit where my preferred shareholders get their 1x preference. I don't get anything except an earn out at a big company. No one's going into it to get that. The people are going into it to build generational I think for a lot of them, even building a unicorn and taking it public, having a billion-dollar company, that is in some sense a failure Because they felt like they wanted to be the next Mark Zuckerberg and not the next mid-sized to big-ish software business that is just big enough to be public, but not a business everyone Would recognize the name of. So yeah, in that case, what people are focusing on when they think about the risk is what is the very far right tailed outcome. And that is a very interesting outcome to think about, but is not the outcome most people will experience. And so when you are thinking of those high risk bets, one of the things that ...

- **Adapt or Die**
  - Societies that fail to adapt to new technologies often face significant consequences, even if the technologies feel world-ending to those resistant.
  - History shows a pattern of adaptation, where humans adjust to advancements despite initial disruptions. 
  - While adopting new technologies can create vulnerabilities, it also unlocks greater productive capacity that eventually offsets the risks.
  - Countries that reject technological progress risk being overtaken by those who embrace it.
  - There's a responsibility to continuously improve and innovate, building upon the progress of past generations.

  And so far, we haven't seen a lot of cases of a country completely self-destructing because they adopted a new technology. What we have seen is that it feels like the end of the world to people who didn't adopt that new technology. So the last couple samurai who are fighting in a very noble, very brave way against soldiers of the Japanese government who have firearms, to them, that was the end of the world. That's the existential risk they were fighting, and runaway technological growth did actually end the world. But for the rest of us, no, we've just kind of adapted to a world where we're still human beings, and it turns out that human flourishing is actually a lot easier in a world that is advanced Enough to support things like firearms and other things, not just guns. That's not like the telos of humanity is building bigger and better guns. But we did learn to adapt to that. To a nomadic hunter-gatherer, this is in some sense the end of the world. It is at least a form of collapse where you lose the territory you live in shrinks by orders of magnitude. Because instead of you living wherever the hunting is good and just traveling to a new place, if you get bored or don't like it or there are local hostile people or you've killed all the Available wildlife, instead of that, you're stuck in one place because that's where you've planted your grain and you're going to be there until you harvest it. And you gradually accrete other things nearby, like your irrigation system. And maybe there are other villagers who buy and sell things who have other goods that they specialize in. To some extent, that was the end of one world. But it was the beginning of a different world where the people are still anatomically humans and we still have the same human adaptability. We still develop new institutions that make more sense for settled farmers than for hunter-gatherers, and we keep on iterating. And I think early on, that technology did create some brittleness and some vulnerability. So a famine or a drought is a lot worse if you are a settled farmer because you can pick up and go, but you're starting from the beginning. Whereas if you're a nomad, then picking up and going is just what you do all day, every day anyway. It does create some brittleness and some dependencies, but it creates just so much more material productive capacity that that eventually offsets things. And so, you know, one story you can tell of just human civilization over the last 3,000 years is that the farmers and farmer-type norms did gradually develop more and more of an edge against The nomads. And then once the world had, on a GDP-weighted basis, mostly adopted those norms, then we started to develop a new set of norms because there's a new set of things that are not purely land-driven. So things like manufacturing and trade, they're not purely land-driven. Technology has more of a direct, measurable, immediate impact. And there's just a new attitude towards what do you own? What do you do? What are your social obligations? Even things like family structure makes the different structures of just how do you decide who is who and who belongs where, et cetera. These things all change under new technology systems. But again, if one country decides that old ways work fine, we don't like the existential risk of new technologies like the steam engine, so we're going to keep with our old thing. Eventually, those countries either adapt or they get conquered. And I think that that is just the nature of things. There is not a stable equilibrium where we all get the fruits of other people's high-risk decisions, and we don't have to make any high-risk decisions ourselves. We've all inherited the outputs of good things that our ancestors and that other people in our country and broader civilizational cluster did. We've inherited the outputs of those things. And I think we've actually inherited a responsibility to continue to improve things and pass on something even better to the next generation. And to be cognizant of the risk, like this stuff, it is not like any of this ([Time 1:18:53](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c0aa2ab4-87b8-4a8a-b2e6-1b4ef026f21b))
