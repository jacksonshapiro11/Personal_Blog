- Context Shapes Perception and Value
  Summary:
  Product positioning significantly influences customer perception and competitive landscape.
  By framing the same product in different contexts, businesses can alter consumer assumptions and perceived value. For example, a double chocolate salted caramel muffin operates under a breakfast category, appealing to different purchasing behaviors and price points, compared to a cake that is viewed as dessert.
  This stark difference underscores the importance of context in marketing, as it affects everything from customer choices to competition and pricing strategies.

  Speaker 1
  When, one of the things that really stuck out to me, I was always trying to explain to tech company CEOs with a tech company example. And whenever I did that, the tech company CEOs would say, well, that's a database, you know, and we're not like a database. So I thought I need some examples that have nothing to do with technology. They're really simple. So I was trying to come up with an example and I was on my way to work and I went to Tim Hortons Coffee shop in Canada. So I'm standing in line and the guy in front of me is ordering breakfast. It's 8 a.m. And He orders this thing which is a double chocolate salted caramel Muffin and I was like that is some genius marketing stuff right there. So I've got a piece of cake. It is double chocolate caramel cake. But if I put it in the muffin format, and I call it a muffin, everything about that is different. The whole context around it is different. It is socially acceptable to order double chocolate caramel, whatever, if you say it's a muffin because I'm now comparing it differently. So if I said it was cake, what's cake? Cake competes with all the things that are like dessert. It competes with ice cream and tiramisu and other things you would order for dessert. What does cake cost? Well in a restaurant it's ten dollars fifteen dollars. Where do I get it? I might go to a bakery but I get it at a restaurant too. When I'm talking about a muffin, well, muffin's totally different. A muffin's breakfast, it competes with a bagel and a donut. What do I charge for a muffin? I charge $1, $2 for a muffin. The whole context around it is different. The product, however, the same. Like that thing that you're eating is a piece of cake, whether it's in cake form or muffin form. So I can choose to position it as a muffin. It's the same product, but the assumptions about that, the competitors are different, your value is different. The assumptions that customers have about that product are different because I've placed it in a different context. ([Time 0:04:18](https://share.snipd.com/snip/78c502c1-d0eb-4c01-afb0-912a798b1836))
    - **Note:** Positioning is a muffin vs cake they’re the same thing but calling it something and changing it’s form transform it from a desert to a breakfast food. This is positioning. It’s like the opening scene of the movie where it sets the tone gives the background basis for the relationship
- Positioning Shapes Perception
  Summary:
  The positioning of a product within a specific market category significantly influences customer perceptions and assumptions.
  By labeling a product as CRM, for instance, potential customers automatically associate it with familiar competitors, such as Salesforce, and infer characteristics such as target audience, pricing, and functionality. Effective positioning can streamline marketing and sales efforts by aligning customer assumptions with the product's true value.
  Conversely, poor positioning can create misunderstandings, necessitating additional clarification and effort from sales and marketing teams to correct misperceptions.
  Therefore, strategic category positioning is crucial for a product's success.

  Speaker 1
  I'm just going to talk about the market category. So the category that the product is positioned in. So I walk out and I say I've got this amazing thing. It's revolutionary next generation thing but it's CRM, customer relationship management. If you're tech paypal and you know what a CRM is, you will make a whole bunch of assumptions about that product just because I called it a CRM. So you'll say, well, you must compete with Salesforce. They're the absolute leader in that market, the girl in that market. So I will just assume that you compete there. I will make assumptions about what that product does. I will assume that it tracks deals across a pipeline. I will assume who the buyer of that is. I'll assume it's the head of sales, vice president of sales. I'll even make an assumption about the pricing, even though I said nothing about what that thing is or who the expected customers are of that thing. But if you assume that Salesforce is my big competitor, because they're the absolute leader in that space, I'm not charging more for my CRM than Salesforce is. So this is how this works. What it does is I position that product in a market category. That market category has set off a set of assumptions in the customer's mind about that product. If I do this well, it sets off a set of assumptions about that product that are true and that's great. Now I've saved marketing and sales a whole lot of time energy effort. I don't have to tell you exactly who my competitors are. It's assumed I don't have to list every single feature. A lot of that stuff is considered table stakes in the category. But it works the same way if I do a terrible job of it. So if I do a terrible job of it, I position my product in a market category such that it sets off a set of assumptions about my product that are not true. Now marketing and sales has their work cut out for them on doing this damage that your positioning has already done where they're like, no, no, no, we don't do that. No, no, no. I know you think that. No, no, no. It's not that. It's this other thing. ([Time 0:10:07](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b5ed479f-34b8-4015-9fae-dd31429fecc2))
    - **Note:** Position your product well so the customer understands exactly what you’re selling. Position it well they started going after a small niche market investment banking crm then went up market. You can’t be the best thing to everyone but you can be the best in a niche and grow. Irrationally comes from fear.
- Navigating B2B Value Through Stakes and Fear
  Summary:
  B2B positioning differs significantly from B2C due to the nature of decision-making and the stakeholders involved.
  In B2B, purchases often involve multiple stakeholders, making the stakes much higher for the buyer, who must justify their choices to superiors. Value in B2B is primarily about enhancing or saving money, eliminating the luxury of subjective preferences.
  Decision makers face pressure related to fear of making poor choices, which drives them towards established market leaders, like Salesforce, who represent a safer, more justified option.
  The emotional landscape for B2B is dominated by the fear of negative consequences, reinforcing the importance of clear, rational justification in purchasing decisions.

  What's the difference between B2B positioning and B2C like business to business positioning versus business to consumer positioning?
  Speaker 1
  There's a lot of things that are different. Kind of, if we think about the core of good positioning, the core of good positioning is thinking about what your differentiated value is, meaning the value you can deliver for a customer That no one else can. And then great positioning puts that in a context that a customer can understand it. If we think about value in B2B, it's very different than value in consumer products. Value can be all kinds of things in consumer products. I might buy shoes because I just like the color green, man. Or I'm buying consumer things because I think it makes me look rich, or it's gonna get me a date, or there's a lot of different things that are valuable in consumer. In business to business it's very different. In business to business typically there isn't one person buying. Typically there's a group of people. The average B2B deal there's five to eleven stakeholders in the deal. So if I'm buying accounting software, my boss comes to me and says, hey, I don't like the accounting software we have right now, you go buy us some. That's terrifying. My neck is on the line. If I make a bad choice here, I look bad in front of my boss, the end users don't like it, maybe the software screws up, I get passed over for promotion, I might actually get fired. So there's stakes in a B2B purchase decision. The way we think about value is also really different. I can't go to my boss and say, I just like the vibe of this software. I have to make a business case to my boss for why we should buy it. And in businesses, I mean, we kind of only have two things. We're either helping you make money or we're helping you save money and that's about it. So, you know, I might make a very irrational decision about a product and often we do make very irrational decisions even in B2B about a product, but I can't say that to my boss. I still have to go to my boss and say here's why we picked it here's the list of reasons. There needs to be some justification. That's exactly it.
  Speaker 2
  It's explainable to somebody else.
  Speaker 1
  Exactly. So we think a lot about you know in in consumer, consumer marketers talk a lot about emotion, invoking emotion. In B2B the granddaddy of emotions is fear. Fear of making a poor choice. Fear of looking bad in front of my boss. Fear of getting fired. Like fear of making a mistake drives a lot of decisions in B2B. This is why incumbents, like whoever's the leader in the market, has such an advantage in B2B technology because it is the safe decision. Nobody is going to get fired for picking Salesforce at this point. They have double the market share of their closest competitor. You can go to your boss and say, look, I looked at all the other options, but I picked Salesforce because everybody uses Salesforce. They have a big ecosystem. They have the best this, the best that, they're the biggest. It's the safe choice to make. If you're trying to compete against Salesforce, that's really hard gravity to pull against. It's very risky to pick you if the choice is you versus Salesforce or an established market leader. ([Time 0:20:29](https://share.snipd.com/snip/478f099f-b956-46b9-9d6e-64d5aa213efc))
    - **Note:** Understand what drives someone’s decision making. Fear drives decisions. Irrationality is driven by fear. Cya. Why pick us over the other guy position vs incumbent. When you talk to customers
- Value Lies in Problem Solving
  Summary:
  To succeed, it's crucial to identify real customer needs and pain points rather than assuming them.
  An initial focus on promoting a product as a new database failed due to overwhelming competition, particularly from established players like Oracle. A successful pivot to positioning the product as a data warehouse for analytics demonstrated the importance of clear and precise messaging.
  However, further assumptions regarding the need for speed in query responses were disproven, revealing that only a niche segment required immediate answers, significantly limiting the potential market.
  This illustrates that even innovative solutions can falter if they do not address a genuine customer problem, emphasizing the necessity for startups to thoroughly investigate and understand the market demand before developing offerings.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Really, really innovative. So the original conception of this thing was that it was a database. I joined as the head of marketing and we were having a terrible time selling. The positioning was terrible. Nobody wanted a new database. There's an absolute giant in that market. They're called Oracle. Everybody's standard on Oracle. Everybody gets certified on Oracle. Companies don't want to have multiple database solutions to do something. So we would come in and say, we've got this nifty new database. And the customers would say, well, that's Oracle Shop. We're not married to Oracle. We don't think Oracle is the best thing, but we can't bring in another platform. We eventually repositioned it as a data warehouse, which is a specific purpose-built kind of database for doing analytics, which is exactly what we're doing, what we're doing this BigQuery. So we did that repositioning, and it was much, much better, much better. First call was better, much better than we were doing before. The problem was when we looked at, we had an assumption that if you had these queries that took three days, you would want to be able to do them in 10 seconds versus three days. And it turned out that assumption was wrong. So when we went to the other banks and said, hey, you're doing this thing and it takes three days, and you could use this thing, and it would take three seconds and they're like, it's okay, Nobody's really doing anything over the weekend anyway, we don't need the answer right away. So then we had this question, well well, who needs the answer right away? And we had never asked ourselves that question. Like our whole value proposition is speed, doing this query fast. It turned out the only customers that needed the answer right away were customers that were doing the query for customer service. So their customer calls in, they're on the phone and they're like, hey, I need to know this thing. Well, I don't want to wait three days to get the answer, they want to do it in seconds. Then we looked at the universe of companies that had data of a scale where our thing was appropriate and needed this query answer to do customer service and there was literally ten companies On the planet and that was it. So the addressable market was so small that it wasn't a viable business. So we had essentially built a product that nobody wanted. It was neat, it was really innovative, it was really cool, but there was no market for it. It didn't solve a problem that anybody really had.
  Speaker 2
  So if you're a startup you have limited resources and How do you go about identifying those pain points then to better position your product? ([Time 0:29:53](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d847ac14-2c4f-4ef9-950e-1a431d457a44))
    - **Note:** Find the pain points and your genuine product market fit. Focus on the benefits not the features. Why they matter. Translate feature to value. There is so much competing for your attention so it’s never been more important to be clear and concise about your positioning. Change the frame a good picture is about knowing wear to stand. You can beat Bobby fisher by playing him in a game that isn’t chess.
- Positioning Clarity is Key
  Summary:
  Effective positioning is crucial in helping prospects understand a product's unique value.
  When a potential customer struggles to grasp the offering's essence or its competitive advantages, it signifies weak positioning. Observing customer reactions during sales pitches reveals common issues: prospects often exhibit confusion about what the product actually is, leading to requests for clarification or comparisons with unrelated products.
  This disconnect indicates that the product lacks a clear frame of reference in the customer’s mind.
  Additionally, prospects may recognize the product type but fail to see its value proposition, questioning the necessity of purchasing it over alternatives like using spreadsheets or internal resources.
  Addressing these positioning challenges directly correlates to improving customer understanding and increasing sales effectiveness.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  What it does mean is if we're trying to assess the positioning, what really matters is when we are, when we have a brand new prospect that comes in that doesn't really know too much about Us, how long does it take us before it clicks? And they're like, ooh, I get it. Oh, I get why you're different. Oh, I get why that's good. Oh, I get why. In my career, so I used to be an in-house vice president of marketing. And so the latter part of my career, I was very focused on positioning. So if the CEO hired me, they hired me because I could talk intelligently about how we were going to fix this positioning. I would come on board and what everybody would want me to do is just run campaigns April, make the revenue go up to the right. I was always worried about running campaigns on weak positioning because it's a bit like pouring water into the leaky bucket and so What I would do to assess the positioning whether It was good or not is I would walk over to sales and there would be people doing sales people doing first calls with customers and you hear it in a first call and it sounds like this Your sales Rep is doing a great They have a pitch. Customers there and the sales rep has has a pitch. This may be a dozen slides long and they're saying, okay, here's what we are. Here's what we do. We do this thing. They're getting into the pitch and you'll see the customer. If it's a video call, you'll see the customer and they'll be making this confused face like and what will happen is and they're not saying too much, and a good rep will stop and be like, Are there any questions? Are you with me still? And the customer will go, yeah, yeah, yeah. Just back it up. Can you just go back to the beginning? Back it up and go back to the beginning. Pitch it to me again. And there's this fundamental disconnect, I don't even know what bucket to put this thing in. Like, is it a database? Is it a business intelligence tool? Is it a thing? Like you haven't framed it. You know and so there's something in that positioning that is just confusing the heck out of the customer. That's the most common sign you see is the customers looking at it and they're like I just can't figure out what this thing is. The second common sign you'll see with weak positioning is the customer thinks they've got it figured out, but they're actually comparing you to something that you don't actually Compete with. So you'll get to slide three or four, and the customer will say, yay, I get it. You're just like Salesforce, and you're nothing like Salesforce. You don't compete in that market, you're not that. And then the rep is like, no, no, no, no, no, let me go back. I'll go back to the beginning we'll do this again so you'll hear that a lot the other thing you'll hear and this is almost the most terrifying one is in these early conversations with a Prospect the prospect will say I get it I get what you are I get who you compete with I just don't really get why we would pay money for that can I just do that with a spreadsheet? Can't I just do that with my accounting package? Couldn't I just hire an intern do that? Why would I pay money to do that? So they kind of understand the product, but again, they don't understand the value of it. Why would I give you money in exchange for that thing? ([Time 0:42:32](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e2e9917e-e519-47f1-a3c1-b0f21f2e9dde))
    - **Note:** Bad positioning is unclear. Positioning blends what the customer knows and allows the prospect to know that. Positioning is talking about the competition and viewing the market in a different or better way than our competitors but requires you to talk about competition and how you relate. Good sales storytelling requires them to understand all the options not just telling them were the best but educating and conversing. What are our trade offs. Have a point of view on the product and market. The other people aren’t wrong you just see the world differently.
- Define Your Perspective to Shape the Market
  Summary:
  Establishing a unique point of view as a CEO is crucial for effectively communicating value to customers.
  Founders often originate their product ideas from frustrations with existing solutions, leading to a distinct perspective on problems that must be conveyed to potential buyers. Successfully articulating this perspective not only engages customers but also guides them through understanding the nuances of the problem being addressed, which is vital for driving sales.
  In emerging markets, where standard vocabulary is absent, it is essential to define the market category and its key concepts.
  By naming and framing this new category, companies can clarify the issues at stake, raising awareness among customers about problems they may not recognize.
  This educational approach allows companies to position themselves as the solution to these newly identified problems, facilitating customer acceptance and driving adoption.

  Speaker 2
  How important is that from a CEO perspective at conferences and talks and media to basically put yourself out there and say, I see the world this way, which is slightly different than Most people see it?
  Speaker 1
  I think it's super important. I think this concept of having a point of view on the market is really, really important. Most founders that I've worked with, if you talk about how the original idea for the product came up, they'll say, you know, I was really frustrated. I looked at all the databases and I decided all the databases were doing it wrong. And if you were smart and you knew what I knew, I had a you would build a database like this. Part of what we need to communicate to customers is we kind of need to take them on that journey and say, look, we have a different perspective on this. Like we look at this problem different. It's not the problem, it's we see a problem inside the problem. We have a perspective on the problem that if you understood it the way we understood it, you would pick our stuff. So that point of view I think is really super important and if you can nail that it is the key to selling lots of stuff.
  Speaker 2
  And how important is it to, you mentioned coin the term, like how important is it to define the vocabulary by which the customers use ultimately to make a choice or to own a term so that If it becomes top of mind to them nobody else has that term.
  Speaker 1
  It's really important if you are doing something that is truly innovative, like an emerging thing. So earlier we talked about market categories and most of the time, if you look at the way most successful companies do this, they're going into an existing market category and they're Serving an underserved corner of that and they're expanding from that. About 10% of the time that's not true. 10% of the time we have something that is emerging. It's a market that is emerging. There is no leader in that market right now, because that market doesn't even exist right now. This is something brand new. You could never even do this before, because technology wasn't there to do it, and so it's emerging. When it's emerging, there's no good vocabulary to talk about it, because we've never talked about it before. And often in those cases, what we're doing is we're defining or attempting to define what the boundaries of that emerging market category are, what's important and what isn't important In that emerging market category. In those cases? We often very much do want to put some names on things We may want to specifically name the market category in a way that advantages us We may want to name key concepts inside that In a way That helps customers understand Why this is an important key thing that you need to understand in that. And so if you see companies that have truly done category creation, often they've done a very good job of helping customers understand key things that they needed to understand in order To understand, ah, this is a totally different problem. I didn't even know I had this problem. Because if the customer knew there was a problem and they had that problem, there would be a categories of solutions to solve it already. In emerging markets, we're often addressing a problem that customer doesn't even define it as a problem. They don't even know this is a problem. This's just, this is just the way the word world works. There's no way to solve this problem. If we can help them become problem aware, then you know, that's a step closer to that. Well, you know, now that you know that you have a problem, we're the thing to think, we're the thing to solve that. ([Time 0:56:26](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4000a9b3-8bb3-4407-a682-2a63c3047d18))
    - **Note:** Communicate the problem to customers.
