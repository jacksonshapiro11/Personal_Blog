### Highlights

- Choosing
  You'll notice that I use the word "choosing" frequently. I genuinely believe that we are always making choices and that we have the ability to choose. Choosing can be terrifying because it means we are accountable for our decisions, and there are infinite options before us. It is also frightening because once we have made a decision, we must live with it, it is the death of optionality. But I believe that choosing is the only way to live authentically.
  • **Existential Despair**: A feeling of hopelessness rooted in the existentialist belief that life lacks inherent meaning. This despair arises from the realization of one's absolute freedom and the responsibility for creating one's own essence and purpose.
  • **Anguish**: In existentialism, anguish is the emotional response to recognizing the vastness of one's freedom and the accompanying responsibility for one's actions. It involves the realization that each decision shapes one's essence and affects others, leading to a deep sense of moral responsibility.
  There's a joke I once heard about a philosopher. Before going to bed, he wonders if he will be thirsty during the night. So, he goes to the kitchen and places two cups beside his bed: one filled with water and the other left empty, just in case he doesn't want any water.

    - **Note:** We have agency over our lives and a responsibility to live it we may be despaired by this burden we are fully responsible for ourselves. This joke is philosophy
- How to Be Lucky
  You make your own luck. There's a great experiment that I can't cite, but it has stuck in my mind since I was a child. They identified people as lucky and unlucky, and asked them to count the number of photographs in a newspaper. The unlucky people took a long time to count the photographs, while the lucky people took a very short time. The reason is that the unlucky people were so focused on counting the photographs that they missed the giant text that said, "Stop counting, there are 43 photographs in this newspaper."
  What I took away from this experiment was the idea that it might not be the case that lucky people and unlucky people have different opportunities, but rather that their field of perception is wider. Lucky people can actually see the opportunities. A lucky person and an unlucky person might meet the same businessman, but they might talk about different things. One could be presented with or ask for an opportunity that the unlucky person doesn't even see as possible.
  I often ask myself, "Okay, I'm focused on getting X, but let's not forget to read the headlines." ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvfa8jsga6sxk9kh8a5f4017))
    - **Note:** You need to be lucky by being actively optimistic and increasing your surface area for luck
- I find the most effective way to get someone's attention is to simply give, just like in dating. Hey, I noticed that you read this book on your website. I think you'd like this book too; it's pretty short, etc. Oh, I noticed some tests were failing in your repository. I fixed them for you. Hey! I've added some examples to the codebase. Do you have any feedback?
  There are so many little ways to get people's attention that aren't self-centered. I do this with my consulting too. During the first call, my only goal is to tell you everything I think could help your business. I don't care if you hire me or not. I just want to help. And as it turns out, this leads me to the next part. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvfas4xtrbb9bqw7982f3zd7))

    - **Note:** When you reach out to someone solve a problem for them don't ask how you can help solve a problem put your solution out into the world and let them meet you halfway. part of getting hired is being someone people want to work with
- "You think you want to be a champion until you meet someone who truly knows they want to be a champion." Replace "champion" with "comedian," "boxer," "founder," and so on.
  Do you realize what it takes to be a judo champion?
  You need to sacrifice relationships, break some fingers, go through an ACL tear, and even get a concussion before fighting for the Olympics. You have to endure injuries and wonder if your career is over. You have to get the flu right before nationals and fight through it. And if you lose, you have to refrain from making excuses. That's incredibly challenging, and it's perfectly acceptable to choose not to pursue that path. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvfapeavrsw8jf2g97fs23vf))

    - **Note:** You think you want to be a champion but at the top everyone is so good that the only people who win are those who are willing to die to win and that's ok if that isn't you maybe pick a different game because you'll never be elite. You need to be willingly to die.
- I am a deeply insecure person, and I think my therapist would probably agree that I have low self-esteem. But I am confident just the same. I believe it's important to understand that confidence is the ability to believe despite feeling uneasy.
  > Courage is not the absence of fear, but rather taking action despite the fear.
  I think this applies to many virtues. So I'll only talk about my own experience with confidence. My confidence simply comes from taking action. I know I outwork everyone around me, even if I have no talent. I know I'm willing to make sacrifices, and I know I can focus my energy on a specific goal. Why? Because I've done it so many times in my life.
  > Confidence is the memory of success ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvfayxcvyknw60c4z2hk158x))
    - **Note:** Confidence comes from not some inate sense of success but repeated work to earn success that makes you feel like you've done the work the game requires of you Jordan
- When I started freediving, I swam for an hour every day, six days a week. At the end of each workout, I would practice my breathing routines and apnea training. By the end of my training session, I could swim 80 meters in a pool without taking a breath and hold my breath for 4 ½ minutes. This was important because I knew that during my diving trip, the longest distance I would have to swim was 45 meters and the longest breath-hold would be 2 ½ minutes. By the time I went on my diving trip, I felt relaxed and ready to enjoy the water. I knew I could do it because I had already accomplished it.
  Hitting 30m for the first time
  My personal record for the deepest dive I've done on a single breath is 30m. It was not a very fast dive, so I ended up being underwater for 3 ½ minutes. But how did I feel at the time?
  1. 3.5 minutes is a minute shorter than my personal best, so I knew I could do it.
  2. During the 10-minute rest before the dive, the goal was to lower my heart rate and relax. I was so relaxed that I fell asleep in the water for 10 minutes, and my heart rate was 43 bpm. I woke up, took the last few breaths, and went down. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvfb1qg7a9m9j1njv9c5tma4))
    - **Note:** Do the work to own success then take solace in the fact that you deserve to win. The way to feel confident is to do the reps to earn confidence doing something once is a guarantee of failure. Practice more than you play confidence is the memory of success. The greatest gift you can give yourself is the gift of being enough
- Choosing happiness
  In the short term, you would be much happier if you accepted and admitted to yourself that the reason you don't have what you want is simply because you do not want it badly enough. The sooner you accept that, the happier you'll be. Then the next question is: Do you want to be happy or do you want to achieve what you want? It's not the last question, but it definitely is the next question.
  For who i think my audience is I really recommended Byung Chul Han's book the [Burnout Society](https://www.amazon.ca/Burnout-Society-Byung-Chul-Han/dp/0804795096) or [Psychopolitics](https://www.amazon.ca/Psychopolitics-Neoliberalism-New-Technologies-Power/dp/1784785776).

    - **Note:** Choose happiness and accept the game on the field. Accept life as is and that you don’t have what you want then plan to get it.
- Do It Scared
  I believe many young people struggle with the insecurity of being intelligent. They often feel the need to prove their intelligence by overthinking, excessively planning, and acquiring knowledge before taking action. However, this approach is a waste of time. The more you research, the more you realize how little you actually know. Instead, you just have to do it, even if you're scared.
  > Literature is the most agreeable way of ignoring life.
  The theory is for analysis; it is not for action. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvfbbrmmkvry1qx2rh0880mh))

    - **Note:** Don't learn and over philosophize and read but take action and just do it scared and bad thats the only way to do it confident and good
- You are not your work
  When I was in art school, one thing I discovered was that many people believed they were defined by the work they created. If their work wasn't good, they saw it as a reflection of their skill rather than a reflection of their taste, which was actually superior to their ability.
  You are simply the person who created the work. You are a vessel, a medium for the work, but you are not the work itself.
  The sooner you realize this, the easier it will be to share the work you have produced, receive feedback, develop your skills, and reflect on your taste. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvfbdk6swv5fcs2gjkryscdp))
    - **Tags:** #work-is-a-diary-entry, #identity, #favorite
    - **Note:** You are not your work separate yourself and identity from what you do or else you'll never take chances or learn. Simplicity over complexity. Work as a diary entry. You are literally the best you’ve ever been trying your best and you need to be content with that. There are no right answers in life but don’t take yourself too seriously. Life is a diary entry.
- A Great Person is not Always a Good Person
  Mike Tyson once said, "If you're favored by God, you're also favored by the devil." It's alright to strive for greatness, but it's equally important to choose goodness. Don't neglect your loved ones for work; time is fleeting. Appreciate people and sincerely express your love for them. Grief is the result of unexpressed love, and the key to avoiding grief is to love abundantly.
  Some people claim they will grind for ten years and then relax once they find a partner or something similar, but I believe that's nonsense. You won't be able to do it suddenly without practice. Along your journey of hard work, you must consciously practice winding down and being a good person. Otherwise, you'll only address it after experiencing your first divorce.

    - **Note:** grief is the result of unexpressed love if you throw yourself into the work you'll never be happy you need to spend time with friends cultivate relationships and enjoy the ride because you're never getting off. Don't live for an uncertain future have a plan you execute on and live for today
- It made me question, "If the ox cannot plow, what is it good for?" This struggle consumed me during the latter half of my twenties.
  It is crucial to start practicing self-love. While successful people may attribute their success to their struggles, I believe a significant part of it is simply coming to terms with those struggles. Each person's pain is maximum to them. You have already endured hardships. Seek success because you deserve it and learn to love yourself, rather than punishing yourself for not being good enough.
  You deserve the life that you desire.
  I used to write down "What would I do if I really loved myself?" Sometimes that's hard, especially for someone who has been through a lot of trauma. It can be difficult to even imagine what that would look like. Instead, I now use inverted thinking. What would I do if I really hated myself? What if I wanted myself to lose out as much as possible? What would I do?
  • Stay home all day.
  • If my friends don't ask to hang out, don't reach out to them out of fear of rejection.
  • Don't ask the girl out.
  • Never learn to talk to strangers.
  • Work hard and make tons of money but die an unhappy old man with regrets.
  • Neglect my health and my body.
  • Never learn to cook.
  • Be afraid to dance in public.
  • Make excuses and believe other people are more talented than me.
  • Never look at how far I've come and only focus on what I don't have.
  Whatever it is, just do the opposite.
  Self talk
  What are the mantras you've inhereted from others? How often are you chasing "The Dream" and not "Your Dream?". Really evaluate what you want and why you want it, and make sure your practice talking to yourself.
  Happiness is the quality of thoughts ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvfbp7vxvr3z5ysdyc6vv5rs))
    - **Note:** Practice self love what would you really do if you loved yourself if you don't love yourself along the way you'll fail. Self talk is vital practice your dream and evaluate what you want
- Isolation is the gift, all others are a test of your endurance
  Really value your time alone. It is the only time you can truly see yourself. It is the only time you can truly hear yourself. Isolation is time not only away from people, but also media.
  I believe success truly comes from being yourself, but if you're always surrounded by others the influence is too strong. But if you can truely live in the isolation, you'll be like a still pond. When others project their image onto you, you'll be able to see the ripples clearly.
  The world is a mirror
  The only language you have to describe the world is with your own perception. The world is a mirror. Often your fear of judgement might stem from your own judgement of others. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvfc5xp6aqv47t5z5paj21zp))
    - **Tags:** #reflection, #isolation, #understanding-yourself, #projection, #world-=-mirror, #emotions-cloud-judgement, #favorite
    - **Note:** The world is a mirror and everyone's behavior is more a reflection of themselves than the world around them if someone runs into you they're usually having a bad day not you. Isolation is a gift because you need to spend time with yourself to truly understand and know yourself. Expecting to know yourself without isolation is like expecting to know someone never having talked with them
      Isolation helps us understand ourselves
- Here's a story about how regular people and Buddhist monks anticipated the future. They put both of them into an MRI and told them they were going to get shocked at some random time in the future. What they found was that regular people would have an anxious baseline response minutes before they were going to get shocked, but when they did, it was only slightly higher than the baseline.
  The monks, however, had no resting anxious anticipatory response. There was no overactive brain activity until the moment of the shock. But when they did feel the shock, it was much higher than the group of regular people. They felt more pain!
  The lesson I learned from this is that anticipation likely dampens the sensations at the moment life happens, but at the cost dampening the joy as well, while creating a contraction in the present moment. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvfc3txfhe54f3k6kbgf0mm8))
    - **Tags:** #presence, #anxiety-(worse-than-the-event), #anticipation, #live-in-the-moment
    - **Note:** anxiety is worse than the event maybe not actually but living a life not in the moment is not truly living. Anticipation dampens presents, so you’re pretty much trading off your present happiness with the future. This doesn’t serve you
- You were just a child
  Stuck with me for a bit. I looked at all the stupid things I had done in the past, and all the things that happened to me that I didn't understand. Then someone said to me "you were just a child" and it was honestly the most liberating thing I've ever heard. I was just a child. I didn't know any better. I didn't know.
  > You suffered for no reason. You were just a child.
  Now, you also have to realize that this applies to everyone else too. Its everyone's first time being a person, including your parents. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvfc205p5f58rzh6rrw9ve9k))
