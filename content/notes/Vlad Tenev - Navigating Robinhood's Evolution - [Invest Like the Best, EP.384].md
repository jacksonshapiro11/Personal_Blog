  What worked and what would you do differently?
  Speaker 1
  A couple of entrepreneurs have asked me this. And one exercise that I found useful for myself was to sit down and imagine what the company would look like if a new CEO came in to run it. I'm I'm coming in to fix things and turn things around, even though I've never met the guy. I would ask myself, all right, if Frank Slootman came in here to clean this place up, what are like the 10 things that he would do? I came up with a list, and for us, it surfaced these obvious things that we weren't doing, but that we, for a variety of reasons, maybe we were like clinging on to decisions that we had made In the past that we wanted to be consistent with. And those are the most dangerous because it's very, very difficult to go up in front of the company and say, Hey, this thing that I just told you that we were going to do months ago, I was Wrong. That was the wrong decision. We're just going to completely reverse that much easier for a new CEO to come in and do something like that. Cause all you have to do is say the old guy was a, and everything they did was wrong. So we're just going to change it. So I think that was the usefulness of the thought exercise. And it's like, what was the answer to that? You're gonna have to cut head count, focus on the core of the business. At the time we had very few people actually working on options trading, which was driving a ton of our revenue. And so we like looked at that and said, a smart capital allocator would put more and more people on options trading, make sure those customers are very, very happy with the service they're Getting, because they're generating the lion's share of our revenue. And we were in a situation where you look at the numbers, the more active a trader you were on Robinhood, the more revenue you were generating for us, the less satisfied you were with our Product. There was an inverse relationship between revenue and NPS. And when we kind of grok that we were like, this is a five alarm fire. We have to solve this problem immediately. And we did, we solved that problem within a couple of quarters, much, much faster than I thought possible because we just put our best people on it. Yeah. ([Time 0:47:19](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ba5b081d-1dc0-42a4-8e73-a9d4787887af))
    - **Note:** When going through hard times Imagine if a new ceo came in looked at the problem with fresh eyes what would they change how would the business be different. All problems can be solved in a year. You want it to happen in 2 weeks which is unrealistic but you can do a lot in a year.
- Leverage AI to Replace Human Tasks in Finance
  Summary:
  The integration of crypto infrastructure into startups is poised to disrupt traditional equity management, potentially leading to fewer companies going public in conventional ways and a rise in initial coin offerings (ICOs).
  This shift may initially occur outside the U.S. due to regulatory obstacles, but will eventually influence the U.S. as well. The efficiency gained through crypto applications, exemplified by the cost-effectiveness seen in crypto versus traditional brokerage services, will encourage a broader transition to blockchain technology.
  In terms of artificial intelligence (AI), the focus should be on identifying tasks currently performed by humans in financial services that could be automated.
  Significant financial resources are allocated to traditional customer support, with around $500 billion spent annually on call centers likely facing major reallocations as AI evolves.
  The future of private banking and wealth management presents further opportunities for AI, particularly in improving user experience and reducing the high fees associated with human financial advisors. This transformation suggests a pressing need for financial professionals to adapt their skill sets to the changing landscape driven by AI and crypto technologies.

  Speaker 1
  And that's going to be a force that changes how startups incorporate and manage their equity. And then if you see that continuing in a large portion of new startups doing that, there's going to be less companies going public in the traditional way. And companies will do ICOs instead, and that could fundamentally change the equity markets. Now, the unfortunate thing is there's regulation that doesn't want this to happen and a lot of embedded special interest. So it looks like that might happen outside of the US first, but as the US tends to do, it will eventually catch up. And you will see crypto infrastructure getting more and more embedded into non-token, non-crypto projects. There's clear benefit. Look at the dollar stablecoin analogy. We see the efficiency gains of using crypto infrastructure because we have a crypto business and a traditional brokerage business. The cost of offering those services is dramatically lower on the crypto side. I think it's very, very likely that we move off of mainframes and onto blockchains. And there's like a efficiency benefit outside of all of these things that I've mentioned. I think it's inevitable and Robin Hood can help drive that both on the product and technology side and the policy side, because we want the U S to be a leader here and for us to benefit from All this technology and not clutch our pearls because we are the market leader already in traditional finance.
  Speaker 2
  So how does AI then play a role in some of this and or drive totally different things for your product roadmap, your future, the future of financial services in general?
  Speaker 1
  Crypto's impact is going to be more on the market infrastructure and on the market side. AI's impact is likely going to be a little bit different. I think that when you think about the impact of AI, you should think about what are the types of things that a human is doing for me and financial services that I'm paying a decent amount Of money for. I think there's a lot of distraction in the AI realm, speculative technologies, things that people aren't really doing. And some of those might work and there might be new behaviors, but the things that I know will work are things that you're paying a human a decent amount of money for already that could Be done by AI. And that's both on the company side, where we investing our CapEx, where we spending money on things that could be automated, but also on the customer side, what are services that are Provided by humans that could be automated by this technology, or if they're not automatable already with a bunch of elbow grease, and you can trace the curves and assume the technology Is going to be better and make less hallucinations and less errors, what's going to be automatable in two years? And I think what you come up with is near term, customer support, the global customer support and market is going to see a major dislocation. I mean, not just in finance, but across the board. I was looking at this market, it's one of the biggest markets. I think something on the order of $500 billion is spent annually on call center. And that's going to be reallocated in the next 10 years. You can kind of see that happening very, very directly. Those folks, their jobs are fundamentally changing. They're going to have to do different things. And then in the long run, the really interesting opportunity in finance, I think is private banking and private wealth management and advisory. If you look at the dollars and the revenues, it's quite dramatic. And I think there's a user experience issue on both sides of the barbell of this product. So on the one side, if you're not a high net worth individual and you have $50,000 or less, and you're going to your local Edward Jones or something of that sort, you're paying a very high Percentage, 2%, 3% on that capital, because it has to be worth it to have a human helping you with this. And you're getting not the best service. ([Time 1:03:39](https://share.snipd.com/snip/acd3d8c5-fc43-48ff-940f-5b7ff92429aa))
    - **Note:** Crypto is a systems impact democratization and ease of capital transfer better money formation through tokens and movement and ai is a personal benefit impact like naming suggestions as a travel agent or AI financial advisor giving advice balance of human value and system value.
- Embrace Elite talent Over Bureaucracy
  Summary:
  Prioritize assembling a small team of elite performers instead of a larger workforce of mediocre talent.
  Shift focus from traditional metrics like team size in hiring and promotions to assessing individual impact and achievements. Reduce bureaucracy to streamline processes, making operations effortless and enjoyable.
  Align compensation closely with performance to ensure clarity in promotions.
  While some remote work is acceptable, value in-person interactions as pivotal to fostering collaboration and high performance.
  Continuous improvement is essential, aiming for a culture that embodies efficiency and excellence.

  Into your office and spends a week tearing apart your business. What do you think he would say is the worst part of the Robinhood business today? After all this improvement that happened after 2022?
  Speaker 1
  I mean, I think there's a lot of things that are still not perfect. And we're on the journey of making them better. Yeah. For example, there's probably still a little bit too much bureaucracy, a little bit too much process, or maybe like 25% of the way to building the company that I want to build from a culture Standpoint. And maybe I should articulate what that is. So some things I believe we want to have a relatively small number of the highest quality people. I would rather have a small number of just elite people that I pay more. It sounds obvious, but not a lot of people in my space believe this. And actually, a lot of the incumbents in public companies, if you look at it, they invest heavily in offshoring, which is having large and large numbers of low cost mediocre people. And there's a benefit to that to a certain extent. But my preference would be a small number of amazing people that are elite in their fields that we compensate very, very well. And I just think for me personally, I would have more fun being in that environment. I think people around me will have more fun. And if you're in small groups of elite people, they kind of push each other and the end result is better than what they could do individually, which I don't think is the case for people That are less talented. So that's one thing. I want as little bureaucracy as possible. Things should be effortless to do here. It should be a joy to deploy code and get products to customers. And I want compensation to be sort of close to perfectly tied to performance. So it's very, very clear who's getting promoted and who's not based on how well you're achieving your goals and doing the things that you're supposed to be doing and setting out to do. And in particular, I want to de-emphasize, I think a lot of times when we think about promotions and leveling and recruiting outside people, one of the common things that people look For is the scope of their existing role, which translates into how big of a team did they lead. Oh, if someone has led a team of a thousand people, surely they're good enough for Robin Hood, where they can lead a team of 500 people or more. I think at a lot of companies that creates an incentive to hire empire builders that are inefficient. And what I instead want is someone that's done big things with as few people as possible. Those are kind of the North stars, a culture of high performance, top talent in person. I think in person is valuable. And I'd say I'm remote tolerant, but I don't think the future is fully remote and distributed companies, at least while humans are involved. I mean, maybe if we get to mathematical super intelligence, things will look different. I think there's a huge benefit. And I think if Frank Slootman came in, I don't know exactly what he would say, but I'd say we're maybe like 25 or 30% along these journeys and there's still ways we can improve. I don't think there's anything major that hasn't been started yet. ([Time 1:08:51](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d5dca15e-9ab8-40a2-90be-18be7c03ac88))
    - **Note:** How to hire teams. Smaller teams of elite talent you pay more give them agency.
- Courage to Pursue Your Path
  Summary:
  Navigating transitions, especially in education and career, requires courage and support.
  Seeking a leave of absence to pursue entrepreneurship demonstrates the importance of taking risks for personal growth. Supportive mentors can significantly empower individuals, offering encouragement and an open door for return, fostering a safe exploration of new paths.
  The experience of failure is often an essential aspect of success, leading to self-discovery and commitment to one's true calling.
  Reconnecting with mentors years later highlights the lasting impact of such pivotal conversations, reminding us that asking for what we need can yield unexpected and positive outcomes.

  Speaker 1
  Oh, well, I'm sure many, many people have done kind things. Thing that I found myself reflecting on recently is when I left my PhD program, I left my PhD program in 2008 to start my first business. To go into the office of the department vice chair, who was this guy, Dmitry Shlatenko. This is at UCLA. And Russian guy, which means intimidating in his own right, but he was a very nice guy. And I had to ask for permission to take a leave of absence. And at that point, I didn't really have any safety net. Of course, my parents could support me, but I was very rightful. And to me, having my parents have to support me was just not very acceptable. And I didn't have money. And I was a grad student. And I had this idea that was very risky of starting a new business with my partner. I wanted to ask for a leave of absence. And I was like, sweating. I was preparing for this meeting for a long time, what am I gonna say? And I thought that there was a pretty good chance you'd say, Yeah, you can leave, but making a big risk, and you're not going to come back. But this guy was so encouraging. He's like, Oh, well, you'd like to become an entrepreneur. I wish you well. And by the way, if it doesn't work, we love you here, we'd always welcome you back. And that made me feel so good. And it sort of like empowered me to feel comfortable leaving just knowing that I could come back and that they wouldn't make it difficult for me. So a year later, they sent me an email and I had to figure out whether I was going to like try to extend my leave of absence. But they're like, are you coming back? And a year later, nothing was working. I was an entrepreneur, my first business was failing. Everything was in disarray and on fire. But I had loved being an entrepreneur so much. I knew it's what I wanted to do, that I was just like, I'll figure it out. I'm not going back, this is it for me. I'm an entrepreneur, and there was no going back. But over that year, a lot of learning about myself and growth had to happen for me to get to that point. And I just think that conversation was absolutely defining for me, I was still very uncertain about whether I should even do it. And then about 10 years later, I was invited to give the commencement at UCLA math. So I was invited to give a talk in front of the students. And they invited me to this dinner where I think Dimitri Schlatenko was there and we talked about this thing and he remembered the meeting very fondly too. He was like, you know, I remember you came into my office, you asked for a leave of absence, you said you were starting a business. Very, very few people actually from the mathematics department businesses. And I always use it as an example to people. You don't have to be a mathematician. Everyone thinks like it's a dead end career. Cause if you're not a mathematician, it doesn't make sense to do the major. And one of the reasons we invited you is very few people actually start businesses and we want more people to do that. I thought that was just very, very nice and he remembered it. Yeah, I think sometimes you have to ask for stuff and you'll be surprised what happens. ([Time 1:14:52](https://share.snipd.com/snip/83d3960a-13c5-4385-b136-169f047925d2))
    - **Note:** His decision to leave his path as a mathematician and go out on his own. Having trust and support from others and pushing through even when it wasn’t working.
