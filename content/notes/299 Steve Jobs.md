- The Vision of Steve Jobs: A Sense of Possibility
  Key takeaways:
  - Steve Jobs was inspired by the idea of human progress
  - His mind was imaginative and saw what reality lacked
  - He believed in the possibility of change for the better
  - This introduction was written by his wife, Lorian Powell Jobs
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  He was compelled by the notion of being part of the arc of human existence, animated by the thought that he and that any of us might elevate our expedite human progress. It is hard to see what is already there, to gain a clear view. Steve's gift was greater still. He saw clearly what was not there, what could be there, what had to be there. His mind was never a captive of reality. Quite the contrary. He imagined what reality lacked and set out to remediate. His ideas were not arguments, but intuitions, born of a true inner freedom and an epic sense of possibility. In these pages, Steve drafts and refines. He stumbles, grows, and changes, but always, always, he retains that sense of possibility. I hope these selections ignite in you the understanding that drove him, that everything, that everything that makes up what we call life, was made by people no smarter and no more capable than we are. That our world is not fixed, and so we can change it for the better. That was the introduction written by Steve's wife, Lorian Powell Jobs, of the book that I'm going to talk to you about today, which is available for free. The Steve Jobs Archive put this book available for free. ([Time 0:03:54](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f42c8565-99e8-40b4-a29b-c25b7748be77))
    - **Note:** Everything created was by people no smarter than you. Never have your mind be a captive of reality.
- The Importance of Making Something with Care and Love
  Key takeaways:
  - Making something with care and love transmits a deep appreciation to others
  - We should be true to ourselves and remember what's important
  - Steve Jobs' lost interview is a valuable resource for insight into his ideas and thoughts on creativity
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  But somehow, in the act of making something with a great deal of care and love, something is transmitted there. It is a way of expressing to the rest of our species our deep appreciation. We need to be true to who we are and remember what's really important to us. This idea, it's the act of making something with a great deal of care and love. In addition to reading this book, I went back through and deep into the Steve Jobs rabbit hole, there's this interview of him that was lost and found after he died. It was an interview given about a year before he came back to Apple. It's called Steve Jobs the Lost Interview. I have never found it anywhere else except on YouTube. You have to buy it. I think I paid like 10 or 15 bucks for this or something. But it's just Steve Unfiltered talking for an hour and 20 minutes. I'll leave the link in case you want to buy it, but I also took a bunch of notes on it and you can read through my notes as well. There's something he says in the interview that is very similar. That interview was given about 11 years, 12 years before he did this quote, where he's like, it's the act of making something with a great deal of care and love. That is Steve's implicit advice to you and I. Actually care. Do you actually care about what you're putting out to the world? If you do, it'll show. Are you just doing it just to make money? What I love about Steve is no one's ever going to say that this guy was motivated by money. ([Time 0:06:48](https://share.snipd.com/snip/cff0512d-e3be-42ec-a49f-7081dedb5ef3))
    - **Note:** Make things with care and love not to make money.
- The Importance of Care and Love in Product-Making and Company Building
  Key takeaways:
  - Make something with care and love
  - Caring about your product and company is obvious to others
  - Ideas are powerful and can shape your life
  - Building a company at the intersection of arts and technology is a valuable idea learned from Edwin Land
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Make something with a great deal of care and love. From the product that you're making to the company that you're building, it'll be obvious if you actually care. I think that's the advice that Steve would give us. Let's go back to the introduction written by his wife. I just want to pull out a couple of things when I was reading this that popped my mind. One of the lines that she says is, much of what's in these pages reflect guiding themes of Steve's life. His sense of the worlds that would emerge for marrying the arts and technology. The reason this is so important to you and I, it's something you and I have discussed over and over again, is ideas are extremely powerful. Your mind is a powerful place which you feed it affects you in a powerful way. There's an idea. That one idea, Steve learned when he was in his early 20s, the idea is that you should build a company at the intersection of arts and technology. That is Edwin Land's idea. That is an idea that Steve Jobs learned from Edwin Land, that Steve used when he was in his 20s, his 30s, his 40s, his 50s, till he died. And the reason I want to resurface that is because if Steve was here today, he would tell you to study Edwin Land. That's why I repeat it so much. I actually heard this hilarious tweet the other day where somebody said that a lot of people's alarm clocks are David Goggins telling them to gaffer it. And mine is David Senra yelling at me to be more like Edwin Land. So I thought that was hilarious. And that's not even my idea. ([Time 0:09:06](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7f686bba-1bf1-4210-8d9a-3f3419f9647f))
    - **Note:** Build a company at the intersection of arts and technology listen to others Steve listened to Edwin lande. Ideas are immortal. Unapologetically extreme be a yardstick of quality. Excellence is expected.
- The Lesson Steve Jobs Learned From Edwin Land
  Key takeaways:
  - Excellence is expected in environments where it is not the norm
  - One must impose strict high quality standards on oneself to lead others to do the same
  - Being a yardstick of quality is important to achieving success in work
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  He was unapologetically extreme in the sense that, hey, the work has to come first. And so he says, be a yardstick of quality. Some people aren't used to an environment where excellence is expected. Excellence is expected. And that only works if you can't lead other people to do that unless you impose that strict high quality standards on yourself. ([Time 0:11:03](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d79e6353-87ab-405b-8e72-97d9c1c283b2))
    - **Tags:** #high-standards, #yardstick-of-quality, #culture-(strong/intentional), #unapologetically-extreme, #strict-with-yourself-lenient-with-others, #expect-excellence, #steve-jobs, #lead-from-the-front
    - **Note:** Yardstick of quality and excellence. You should propose stricter standards on yourself than others could ever on you. You need to be a yardstick of quality set high absolute standards and lead from the front
- Steve Jobs' Early Years in Silicon Valley: A Glimpse from a 1995 Talk
  Key takeaways:
  - Having a remarkable and hardworking father helped shape Steve's character
  - Steve's father taught him the value of making things and having agency in creating things that can benefit others
  - Steve's father had a workbench in the garage where he taught him important lessons
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So it says, I was very lucky. I had a father who was a pretty remarkable man. He never graduated from high school. He joined the Coast Guard in World War II and ferry troops around the world for General Patton. And I think he was always getting into trouble and getting busted down. He was a machinist by trade and worked very hard and was a kind of genius with his hands. And actually read this next paragraph to my daughter. This is something we've been talking about and trying to teach her as well. And so my note on this section is one of the best things a parent can do for a child. Teach them to make things. Teach them that they have agency and that they create and they can create things that other people can do. And that they can do things that other people can use and benefit from. He had a work in this now, Steve talking about one of the most important lessons that his father taught him. He had a workbench out in the garage. When I was about five or six, he sectioned off a little piece of it and said, Steve, this is your workbench now. And he gave me some of his smaller tools and showed me how to use a hammer and a saw and how to build things. ([Time 0:16:19](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5eee02fd-5654-4c9f-a419-e4d50d6b9231))
    - **Note:** Teach prople they have agency. They can make things. The world is malleable.
- The Importance of Understanding Human Creation
  Key takeaways:
  - Early love for reading is a common trait among history's greatest entrepreneurs
  - Steve Jobs learned to read before starting school and loved reading books
  - Steve Jobs' experience with authority in school almost killed his curiosity
  - According to the founder of Patagonia, studying the juvenile mindset is key to understanding entrepreneurs
  - Steve Jobs struggled with college at age 19
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And we're going to see. This is something that this is ever-present in history's greatest entrepreneurs, an early love for reading. So he says, my mother taught me how to read before I got to school. And so when I got there, all I really wanted to do was just two things. I wanted to read books because I love reading books and I wanted to go outside and chase butterflies. And then we're going to see, this is, I talked about this I think last week as well in the week before, maybe the all-time greatest quote on understanding the mindset of an entrepreneur comes from a von Schonard, the founder and owner of Parnagonia. If you want to understand the entrepreneur, study the juvenile in liquid. And so we see this in Steve's early childhood. He gets to school and he says, I encountered authority of a different kind than I had ever encountered before. And I did not like it. And they really almost got me. They came this close to really beating any curiosity out of me. And then he describes his difficulty with college. This is Steve Jobs at 19. ([Time 0:19:15](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a7ab287d-4e0d-4324-bad4-a3998d384816))
    - **Note:** Love for reading the creativity almost got beat out of him at school. Steve made products for craft that he loved. Steve had many lost years.
- The Missed Opportunity to Own Part of Apple
  Key takeaways:
  - The speaker and their associates built and delivered 50 computers and got paid in cash, which created a profit realization crisis because their profit was tied up in computers that hadn't been sold yet.
  - The speaker and their associates pitched the idea for the computer to two other companies who both said no, but they eventually took the idea to HP and Atari.
  - Nolan Bush, founder of Atari, recounts his biggest regret in life being that he turned down 30% of Apple for a relatively small amount of money.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And so he says, we got paid in cash. So we built 50 of them and delivered them. We got paid in cash and then ran back and paid the people that sold us the parts. We had this classic Marxian profit realization crisis, which was that our profit wasn't liquid. It was in 50 computers sitting on the floor because they had made 100 of them sold 50 and they're like, okay, now, if we sell this other 50, this is where our profit is, right? So then we did, and this was fascinating. They went up pitching the idea, which is going to wind up being Apple to two other companies to see if they wanted to do it, like in their company or to invest. They both said, no, we took our idea for the computer to a few companies. One was HP where was was working. And one was Atari where Steve was working. Nolan Bush now, the founder of Atari, recounts in his book and a bunch of other interviews I've seen with them. Biggest regret in his life. He was offered 30% of Apple, I think for like 50,000 or 100,000. It was something like that. And he said, he said, no. So he says, no one was interested in pursuing it, so we started our own company. And so this is a very important part. Like, we can't gloss over this. This is absolutely fascinating. If you actually slow down at thinking the story, he just told. This is the very beginning. This is what a trillion dollar company looks like 50 years before it's a trillion dollar company. No one else wanted to do this, so guess what? I guess we'll have to do it ourselves. ([Time 0:26:20](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b2bfbec7-fd9c-41a9-b914-10720b11aacb))
    - **Note:** No one wanted to do it so they did it themselves. They couldn’t get any funding they had to sell their car to get it done.
- The History and Design of Personal Computers
  Key takeaways:
  - Apple started as a personal computing manufacturing company and is now the largest personal computer company in the world
  - Apple’s personal computers were designed to look like a portable typewriter and are able to display in color, which users found impressive
  - Steve Jobs gave a speech in 1983 at the International Design Conference in Aspen which compared computers and society to a first date, and criticized the lack of design in computers compared to other products like automobiles and buildings
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Same with computers. We started a little personal computing manufacturing company in a garage in Los Altos in 1976. Now we're the largest personal computer company in the world. We make what we think of as the Rolls-Royce of personal computers. It's a domesticated computer. People expect blinking lights, but what they find is that it looks like a portable typewriter, which connected to a suitable readout screen, is able to display in color. There's a feedback it gives to people, and the enthusiasm of the users is tremendous. And so then in the book is something I don't think I've ever seen before. It's a transcript of the speech that Steve gives. He would be around 28 years old. This is in 1983. So he's around 28 years old. It's at the International Design Conference in Aspen. And the theme of the speech is that computers and society are out on a first date. And so listen to what he does. He says, if you look at computers, they look like garbage. All the great product designers or off-designing automobiles are buildings. Hardly any of them are designing computers. So something that appears over and over again is something I cannot stop thinking about. And I just read it randomly. I think it was an Isaacson's biography of Steve, where it says one of his great talents was spotting markets full of second-rate products. Steve is a world-class product designer, right? Even at this age. And he's saying, this is kind of weird. Like, I think this industry is going to be extremely important. Other people don't seem to agree with me. ([Time 0:28:59](https://share.snipd.com/snip/342c2ae5-5eee-4467-aded-96456768ce75))
    - **Note:** Spot markets for second rate products and crush them. The talent wasn’t designing computers
- Steve Jobs' Historical Knowledge and Dedication to Innovation
  Key takeaways:
  - Steve Jobs dedicated his life to making tools and products to better other people's lives
  - Steve Jobs had a deep historical knowledge that he applied to his work
  - Steve Jobs believed in exposing oneself to the best things humans have done and incorporating those ideas into one's work
  - Steve Jobs and other inventors, like Alexander Graham Bell and Edwin Land, looked to past inventions and marketing strategies for inspiration
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  You say, I was here. My life mattered. And I wanted to make something that made the lives of other people better. And so not only is Steve telling us that with his words, but we saw that with his actions, he dedicated his life to making something wonderful, these tools and these products that you and I use to this day, more than a decade after he's gone. And so then we go into Steve talking about the Macintosh. This is a year before he gets kicked out of Apple. And what we're going to see here is something, again, I deeply admire about him. He had this deep historical knowledge. He had it when he was a young man. He could talk like this when he was 21, 22 years old. He still had it at 30. He was still talking about it when he was in his 50s. This is a quote from Steve Jobs, a lost interview that I'm going to read that really sets up this section of the book. I really think the book and this interview go so well together. And so he's asked the question, how do you know what is the right direction to move in? And this is what Steve said that gives me goosebumps. It comes down exposing yourself to the best things that humans have done. Then try to bring those things into what you are doing. Picasso had a saying, good artist copy, great artist steal. And we've always been shameless about stealing great ideas. He goes back and thinks about the construction and the invention of the Macintosh and the marketing and sales of the Macintosh. Went back and looked at how Alexander Graham Bell invented and marketed the telephone. And he talks about Henry Ford as well. Edwin Land did the same thing. When Edwin Land went and invented the instant, the polo camera, right? And he invented not only the camera, but the entire, the entire instant photography industry. ([Time 0:34:13](https://share.snipd.com/snip/61f30552-c0e3-4b17-a71a-469a73cc9786))
    - **Note:** Deep historical knowledge good artists copy great artists steal.
- The Unlikely Success Stories of Next and Pixar
  Key takeaways:
  - Steve writes a check for the company deficit
  - Nexus Focus shifted to selling software, closing a factory and laying off employees
  - Pixar stripped away advertising and hardware businesses to pursue computer animated feature films
  - Toy Story was the first computer animated feature film and a massive success
  - After a decade of difficulty, Next and Pixar became success stories
  - Apple bought Next for $427 million
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Like, oh, we have a couple of things that we're doing. And then whatever the deficit is, I go and meet Steve every month and he just writes me a check from his personal checking account. How insane is this? Back to what Leslie Bruin is selling. Steve learned how to hone a company to its essence, even when it was painful. He shifted Nexus Focus to selling software. That shift meant closing a factory and laying off more than 200 of Nexus 530 employees. Meanwhile, Pixar stripped away its advertising and hardware businesses and entered into agreement with Disney, all to pursue with something, what sometimes seemed an impossible dream to make fully computer animated feature films, which had never been done before Toy Story. It was obviously the first one in history. It goes on to be a massive success. After nearly a decade of difficulty, the streamlined Next Impix are both transformed into unlikely success stories. At the end of 1995, Pixar premiered Toy Story in the same month it held its initial public offering. A year later, Apple, in a need of an operating system, bought Next for $427 million. Quote from Steve, if you really look closely, most overnight successes took a long time. I would say all of them. I can't think of an exception to that at the moment. If you really look closely, most overnight successes took a long time. What I wrote to myself when I got through these few paragraphs, how many people were willing to go through a decade of difficulty without quitting. And so in the book, there's this picture of this excellent memo that he sent to the team at Next in 1986. ([Time 0:45:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4fb52913-d939-4d43-a1fd-851db8acd50e))
    - **Note:** Steve’s lost years at next and Pixar set the stage for the rest of his career. Decade of hardship.
- Building Character During Tough Times
  Key takeaways:
  - It's better to have fewer people and build the company slowly and carefully rather than turn into managers instead of doers.
  - Character is built not in good times, but in bad times.
  - Steve Jobs gave a speech to incoming freshmen of his alma mater during a time of struggle for companies he was associated with.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I believe that if we turn ourselves into managers instead of doers, both our schedule and the greatness of our product will suffer. Let's not let this happen. It is better to have fewer people, even if it means doing less. Let's build our company slowly and carefully. And so it's during this time of struggle. In 1991, he's actually asked to give a speech to the freshmen, the incoming freshmen of his alma mater, which I don't know, do you call it an alma mater if you need to? So from Reed College, he's asked to give this speech. And the reason this is important, and you'll see which point I chose to highlight, is because Next is computers, they're not selling and Pixar just had a round of layoffs. So he's saying this, like the title or the main idea behind the speech is that character is built not in good times, but in bad times. And if you think about it in the context of where Steve's at, it's almost like he's giving advice to himself. So he says, the last experience I wanted to account for you, there is a man, and I think he's here today. His name is Jack Dunman. He used to be the dean of the school. He was one of the heroes of my life while I was here because Jack looked the other way when I was staying on campus without paying. He looked the other way when I was taking classes without being a formal student and paying the tuition. ([Time 0:47:37](https://share.snipd.com/snip/17c1de14-d49f-4c8d-8d2c-2b08726b94c2))
    - **Note:** Character is not built in good times it’s built in bad times. The dean of reed college let him take classes for free and helped him financially when Steve was there flat broke. Help from others.
- Email exchange between Steve Jobs and Intel engineer regarding Pixar's secrets
  Key takeaways:
  - In 1995, an email exchange occurred between an engineer at Intel and Steve Jobs regarding the sharing of Pixar's secrets for use in Intel's microprocessors.
  - Steve Jobs raised concerns about the value of Pixar's secrets and asked what Intel proposed to give in exchange for disclosing and licensing those secrets.
  - The engineer from Intel responded that they had not entered into any financial arrangements in the past and did not intend to do so in the future.
  - Steve Jobs was not satisfied with this response and criticized Intel's poor performance in graphics architectures as evidence that their approach did not work well.
  - Steve Jobs went on to contact Andy (last name not mentioned) in what would later become the opening for an unknown topic.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And so we see this email chain between Steve, this engineer, that Intel whose name is not released and then Steve Jobs. And so the engineer's like, hey, you know, I talked to Andy, we're going to study from you. We're taking this really seriously. Like, let's get our two teams together, whatever. And then Steve hits them back. This is in 1995. Pixar's secrets were invented through significant investment over 10 years or more. And we value them highly. What does Intel propose to give Pixar for disclosing and licensing its secrets to Intel? And so the engineer responds, like, oh, well, you know, we have not entered into any financial arrangement in exchange for good ideas for our microprocessors in the past. And we don't have an intention to do so in the future. And so then Steve did not like that. And then we see in his response, this approach has not served you well in the past as evidenced by your poor graphics architectures and performance. Maybe you should think of changing it for the future. And so then Steve emails Andy and this is going to, this is going to be the opening for Andy to school and to teach Steve Jobs, like the younger Steve Jobs. And Steve's credit. He also says this in the lost interview, the one I keep referencing that I watched and listened to in addition to reading this book. He's just like, listen, I don't care about being right. I care about being excellent. So if somebody presents information to me, you can ask people on my team that all and there's a different opinion. I'm like, I will change my idea. I don't care where the ideas come from, I just want to be excellent. And we see that in the email. He has his opinions, like Intel should pay us for this. ([Time 0:50:28](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0da01382-cc58-4d24-b6de-123cf6500563))
    - **Note:** Don’t care about being right. Be excellent. Change your mind when you’re wrong.
- The Power of Shopping for Information Online
  Key takeaways:
  - Shopping on the web involves buying or finding information and making important decisions.
  - Access to information on the web allows for special interest groups and learning from others with similar interests.
  - The interviewee experienced pain and emotional distress from being forced out of their own company, but still moved forward.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  It is not just shopping for goods and services. It is shopping for information. You are going to be buying information or finding information and really making a lot of decisions about what you're going to do with your life and what you're going to purchase from the web. He continues. There's a lot of things happening with the web in terms of allowing people to access information that they would have never have before. What this does, of course, is let special interest groups get together. In other words, you're able to find other people just like you. The same exact interests that you have and you can learn from each other and you can do it whenever you want because it's all on demand. That's insane. Then the interview goes back to this idea. It's like, how did this field to be forced out of the company that you created? Even 10 years later, he says this in the lost interview. It's like, if we keep talking about this, I'm going to get emotional. It's still very painful. In this interview, he says, of course, that was a very painful time, but you just march forward and you learn from it. One of the things I've always tried to coach myself on was not being afraid to fail. When you have something that doesn't work out, a lot of times, people with reaction is to get very protective about never wanting to fall on their face again. I think that's a big mistake because you never achieve what you want without falling on your face a few times in the process of getting there. I've tried not to be afraid to fail. Matter of fact, I've failed quite a bit since I left Apple. ([Time 0:55:32](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c02d3f9b-c8a4-4846-ae00-b3f2e3edb20e))
    - **Note:** Don’t be afraid to fail. Failure is part of life.
- "Great Can Come from Anywhere": The Power of Believing in Non-Hierarchical Ideas in Corporate Culture
  Key takeaways:
  - Great ideas can come from anywhere and anyone, even in unexpected places
  - Apple's corporate culture valued ideas over hierarchy
  - There was no belief in a hierarchy of ideas that aligned with the organization's hierarchy
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  But in that documentary, Jimmy Iveyne is saying, great can come from anywhere. And what he was talking about is the fact that he found a demo tape that Eminem handed out at the Rap Olympics that was handed to Jimmy's A&R that he gave to Jimmy. Jimmy heard it and he's like, oh, I'll give it to Dr. Dre and the rest is history. And he was talking about this guy, this is the middle of nowhere. There was no giant hip-hop scene in Detroit at the time. It was all West Coast, East Coast at the time. It's like great can come from anywhere. Great can come from anywhere. Why did I think about that? Because listen to what Steve is going to say to us here. I would say Apple had a corporate lifestyle. A few very big differences to other corporate lifestyles that I'd seen. The first one was a real belief that there wasn't a hierarchy of ideas that mapped onto the hierarchy of the organization. Damn, that's a good line. There isn't a hierarchy of ideas that are going to map onto the hierarchy of the organization. In other words, great ideas could come from anywhere. And we better sort of treat people in a much more egalitarian sense in terms of where the ideas came from. Great can come from anywhere. And so their conversation continues and she's like Terry Gross, I think, or gloss. I think her name is Terry Gross. She's the one interviewing him at this point. And they're like, well, this is like a very different approach to corporate hierarchy. ([Time 0:59:21](https://share.snipd.com/snip/183492f8-9d40-4ce0-aa3e-bee6e6c873cb))
    - **Note:** Non hierarchy great can come from anywhere. Never saw a different between work and life.
- Developing Intuition and Creativity for Exploring Unchartered Paths
  Key takeaways:
  - Be aware of the world's magical, mystical, and artistic sides
  - The most important things in life are not the goal-oriented, materialistic things that everyone and everything tries to convince you to strive for
  - Pay attention to your intuitions and nurture them
  - Be a creative person by connecting previously unrelated experiences and insights
  - Invest in yourself by exploring diverse experiences and not traveling the same path as everyone else
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And he says, I'm supposed to offer you some wisdom and advice that you may remember along your travels. Be aware of the world's magical, mystical, and artistic sides. The most important things in life are not the goal-oriented, materialistic things that everyone and everything tries to convince you to strive for. Most of you know that deep inside. I bet many of you have had some of these intuitive feelings about what you could do with your lives. We are never taught to listen to our intuitions, to develop and nurture our intuitions. But if you do pay attention to these subtle insights, you can make them come true. People will come at you with reasons why you shouldn't do these things. And so then he gives some positive advice. Be a creative person. Creativity equals connecting previously unrelated experiences and insights that others don't see. And one way to be more creative, he says, is you need to get a more diverse set of experiences. And how do you do that? By not traveling the same path as everyone else. And he continues, so to be a creative person, you have to invest in yourself by exploring unchartered paths that are outside the realm of your past experience. Seek out new dimensions of yourself, especially those that carry a romantic scent. But one has no way of knowing which of these paths will lead anywhere in advance. That's one of the most important lines. There's no way to tell an advance. One has no way of knowing which of these paths will lead anywhere in advance. The only thing one can do is to believe that some of which you follow with your heart will indeed come back to make your life much richer. And it will, and you will gain an ever firmer trust in your instincts and intuition. Don't be a career. The enemy of most dreams and intuitions, and one of the most dangerous and stifling concepts ever invented by humans, is the career. A career is a concept for how one is supposed to progress through stages during the training for and practicing of your work life. Many people find what they believe to be safe harbors, like a lawyer or accountant. Only to wake up 10 or 15 years later and discover the price they paid. So I just want to pause here to interject because I do think I have a unique perspective from my vantage point here. ([Time 1:01:57](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1005cade-5033-46b4-9750-329f8fce84d9))
    - **Note:** Chart your own path. Don’t be a career exist at the intersection of uncharted paths. Love your life be creative not a career. Great quote read it all.
- Reflections on Life: Birth, Death, and Regrets
  Key takeaways:
  - Most people have not thought about the events of birth and death, and it's as if we shelter younger generations from them.
  - There is no certainty about what happens to us after our death.
  - Knowing that our time on earth is limited makes us want to make the most of it and leave a trail.
  - Having as few regrets as possible is important. Regrets are different from mistakes and often come from not doing something you wish you had done.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  We all experience both completely alone. And yet most people of your age have not thought about these events very much, much less even seen them in others. How many of you have seen the birth of another human? It's a miracle. And how many of you have witnessed the death of a human? It is a mystery beyond our comprehension. No human alive knows what happens to us after our death. Some believe this, others that, but no one really knows. Again, most people of your age have not thought about these events very much. It's as if we shelter you from them, afraid that the thought of mortality will somehow wound you. For me, it's the opposite. To know my arc will fall makes me want to blaze while I'm in the sky. Not for others, but for myself, for the trail that I know that I'm leaving. And I love the way he ends his speech. Now, as you live your arc across the sky, you want to have as few regrets as possible. Remember, regrets are different from mistakes. Mistakes are those things that you did and you wish you could do over again. In some, you were a fool. In others, he says, usually concerning women. That's hilarious. In some, you were a fool, usually concerning women. In others, you were scared. In others, you hurt someone else. Some mistakes are deep and others are not. But if your intent was pure, then they are almost always enriching in some way. So mistakes are things that you did and wish you could do over again. Regrets are most often things you didn't do and wish you did. So then right before he goes back to Apple, Steve gives an interview that's all about Pixar. ([Time 1:06:33](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e39af91b-27bd-4e3b-a2bf-6de39afec2e8))
    - **Note:** Life is short. Time is the stuff life is made of. Don’t have regrets.
- The Importance of Hiring Great People: Insights from Steve Jobs
  Key takeaways:
  - Quality starts with having great people on your team
  - Recruiting should be a top priority, even for executives
  - Candidates should be judged based on their results and impactful contributions
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  It's excellent. And so the main theme, I would say, of that interview is that you better have great people. That you have to go for great. This is something that Steve talked about in his entire career. You better have great people. There are no shortcuts around quality and quality starts with people. I spend 20% of my time one day a week even now recruiting. And so he goes on about that point for a while and then the interview asks him a great question. If finding a player is so important, how can you tell who an a player is and who isn't? And this is what Steve said. That's a very hard question. Ultimately, there are two paths. If a candidate has been in the workplace for a while, you have to look at the results. There are people who look so good on paper and talk such a good story but have no results behind them. They can't point to breakthroughs or successful products that they shipped and played an integral part in. Ultimately, the results should lead you to the people. As a matter of fact, that is how I find great people. I look at great results and I find out who's responsible for them. But then it makes a great point. Startups usually don't have unlimited capital, so you have to find undiscovered. You have to, you're the one discovering the great talent. However, sometimes young people haven't had the opportunity yet to be in a position or influence to create such results. So here, you must evaluate potential. It's certainly more difficult, but the primary attributes of potential are intelligence and the ability to learn quickly. Much of it is also drive and passion. ([Time 1:09:35](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0627c000-10c9-4adb-8695-300603658395))
    - **Note:** Drive and intelligence as key metrics for success. For experienced people look at prior work. Ceo needs to tell people they need to do better.
- The Importance of a Risk-Taking Creative Environment Combined with a Fiscally Conservative Business Environment
  Key takeaways:
  - The CEO's responsibilities include setting the overall direction, inspiring and persuading
  - A risk-taking creative environment is needed on the product side, while a fiscally conservative environment is needed on the business side
  - The CEO's focus saved Apple, resulting in a stream of breakthroughs including the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad
  - The CEO believed in choosing what to put love into carefully, which reflected in Apple's technology and Pixar's films.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Number two, to set an overall direction and number three, to inspire and cajole and persuade. He gave particular thought to his, oh, this is fascinating too. He gave particular thought to his responsibility for the business aspects of a creative company. He has this combination that's really interesting. And so he says, you need a risk-taking creative environment on the product side, and that requires a fiscally conservative environment on the business side. So on the product side, risk-taking creative environment combined with a fiscally conservative environment on the business side. His second tenure at Apple was a study in focus. Soon after he returned, he slashed the company's product offerings from 17 to 4. This upset some fans and led to thousands of job losses, but he was unwavering in his belief that it was necessary to save the company. You've got to choose what you put your love into really carefully, he said. A stream of breakthroughs, including the iMac, OSX, iPod, iTunes, iPhone and iPad, reflected that focused love. As did Pixar's blockbuster and award-winning films from the same period. Apple's technology offered tools to make something wonderful and Pixar films he believed had the rare opportunity to put stories into the culture, stories that would speak to our grandkids, grandkids, grandkids. Steve wanted to build a foundation for Pixar and Apple that would last beyond his lifetime, and we know from our vantage point that he definitely did. ([Time 1:13:13](https://share.snipd.com/snip/908a1b18-4b0a-4d8f-ba5d-ecdf368746fe))
    - **Note:** His return was about focus. Conservative business with risk in the products.
- Apple's Role as Bridge Builder Between Regular People and High Technology - A Summary by Steve Jobs
  Key takeaways:
  - Apple is the leading company in building user-friendly high technology products that enhance people’s lives. They employ state-of-the-art technology with their legendary ease of use. Apple is known for demystifying technology for the masses, which has a greater impact than anything else they can do.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Apple is the world's premier company of building high technology products that are easy to learn and used by mere mortals. Beginning over 20 years ago, Apple has consistently set the standard for easy to use computer systems and software. Why? Why do we do this? Because we're in love with the potential of personal computers to enhance and enrich the lives of regular people, not just with spreadsheets and data. But with creative, we are a creatively driven company in everything we do. Apple marries state of the art technology with Apple's legendary ease of use to create products that enable users to do more. Apple is the world's permit. This is this is the way you think about like. Think about what he's saying here. Right. So far it's like, okay, where are you going with this? He really summarizes the way he thinks about Apple at this point. Apple is the world's premier bridge builder between mere mortals in the exploding world of high technology, demystified technology. It will have a much greater impact than any other thing we can do. And then we have another email that Steve sends to all Apple employees. This one happens in 2002 and it's actually on his all time favorite quote. And this is quote from Aristotle and Aristotle said, we are what we repeatedly do. Excellence then is not an act, but a habit that was sent in 2002. A few years later, he's giving this interview. I think in like 60 minutes or something like show like that. ([Time 1:29:01](https://share.snipd.com/snip/79dacb1f-ff47-45c1-8a24-18b1f64b8724))
    - **Note:** We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence is a habit. If you do something good just do what’s next. Continue to do what’s wonderful. Don’t do one great thing. Excellence is a habit.
- Learning from the Experience of Others with Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett
  Key takeaways:
  - People in their 50s know more than people in their 20s.
  - Learning from wise people can be beneficial.
  - Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger emphasize the importance of learning from others' experiences.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  He's like the difference of what he thought when he was 20, what he did not know and what Bob was trying to teach him. So it says that now that I'm approaching 50, it's easy to see how people in their 50s know more than people in their 20s. He just kind of tried to give me the lay of the land and tried to give me a perspective that I could only partially understand, meaning only partially understand when he's 20. There's no, some of the stuff like, you know, I've had this happen in my own life. Older people, older wise people try to tell you something like, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's fine for you. And then you realize something happens in your life, you experience and then that's where you learn the lesson. You're like, damn it. That person was right. And this is what I love about Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett. They keep repeating so few people are capable of learning from the experience of others. And Warren and Charlie, like we just happen to be able to be some of those few people that can actually learn from the experience of others. And life is a lot better and easier if you could do that. So I think there's an echo of what Steve's telling us here. So it's like he was giving me a perspective that can only partially stand at that time. I think he was interested in what someone in their 20s thought to. And he was fascinated by the personal computer. The personal computer and Intel had nothing to do with each other at the time. So he was fascinated by that stuff. That was it. So we just became buddies. And there's something that Bob says in his biography where he says something, I think the line, I don't have it in front of me. So I'm going off memory. He says something like the reason he spent so much time mentoring and then investing in young entrepreneurs, it says something like, I wanted to restock the fish, the stream. ([Time 1:33:51](https://share.snipd.com/snip/768c9c4c-d2e6-42dc-a44f-f7cba3848381))
    - **Note:** Steve took a lot of mentorship from Bob noise.
- The Wisdom of an Entrepreneur with 61 Years Experience
  Key takeaways:
  - The guest has been an entrepreneur for 61 years and has extensive knowledge on entrepreneurship.
  - The guest travels around the world at his own expense to share his wisdom and love of entrepreneurship with others.
  - The idea of having an obligation to share knowledge and help others is still prevalent today.
  - Optimism and passion are central to innovation according to Bob Noise.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Like guys been an entrepreneur for 61 years. How many people on the planet can say that they've been an entrepreneur for 61 years? There's some of them. There's a small group of people. Imagine the knowledge that's in this guy's brain. And then what does he do? He goes to troubles all around the world at his expense, sharing his wisdom and his love of entrepreneurship with other people. That is, I want to freaking scream. And you know, that's not the word I was about to say. So I just love this. I just love this idea that we see this over and over again where it's just like, man, I have an obligation. Like Bob Noise said it, you know, Bob Noise has been dead for 30 something years. And yet that same theme, that same, whatever you want to call it, same idea is still alive today. I just absolutely love it. So let's go back to this interview. And so Leslie saying, one of my favorite quotes from Bob is where he says that optimism is a central greeting for innovation. And so this is what Steve says. Well, it's optimism and passion because it's really hard. And if you don't really, really care about what you're doing, you're going to give up if you're a sane person because it's super hard. And I'm sure it was extremely hard for him at times. This is 2003 Steve Jobs. Remember that. It's optimism and passion because it's really hard. If you don't really, really, really care about what you're doing, you're going to give up because you're sane. If you're a sane person, obviously people like Steve Jobs, people like Bob Noise, people like you and I, I don't think people to the average person that are going to think people like us are sane. ([Time 1:35:52](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e8ea64dc-4e72-4a3e-8463-cd564b951ae6))
    - **Note:** Optimism and passion is necessary for success.
- Meeting Someone Special: A Chance Encounter at Stanford's Business School
  Key takeaways:
  - Opportunities that can change your life might come unexpectedly
  - Attending events and accepting invitations can lead to new connections
  - Being committed to your plans can lead to unexpected but valuable interactions
  - Making meaningful connections may require taking initiative and follow-through
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  You can't plan to meet the people who will change your life. I was invited to speak at Stanford's business school a few times a year and I always try to do it. I had accepted an invitation to speak one Thursday late in the afternoon. And I wasn't feeling very well. And I had a dinner late that evening with some important customers. But he decides anyways to go. So he's like, Oh, it doesn't matter. I said I was going to do this. So I'll do this. He says, it didn't take me long to notice this really cute girl sitting next to me. I think she was stunned when it was me that got up to speak. And I knew something was up when I was staring at her, forgetting what I was talking about mid sentence. After my talk, I stayed around to speak with some students and then she stayed too. But then she left and I didn't know who she was and I thought I might never see her again. So I wound things up and left and caught her and caught up with her in the parking lot. I asked her if she would have dinner with me on Saturday. She said yes and gave me her phone number. As I was walking to my car, this is one of my favorite things he ever did. And he says, as I was walking to my car, I asked myself. If this was the last day of my life, would I rather have dinner with the important customers or her? I raced back to her car just as she was about to drive off and asked her, how about dinner tonight? She said sure. And we were married 18 months later. You can't plan to meet the people who would change your life. It just happens. Maybe it's random. Maybe it's fate. Either way, you can't plan for it. But you want to recognize when it happens and have the courage and clarity of mind to grab onto it. ([Time 1:47:52](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b9205a84-2971-454b-95b5-6cbb101b156f))
    - **Note:** You can’t plan for the people who change your life you just need to recognize it and grab on your it when it happens.
- Investing in Ourselves: Learning from Biographies
  Key takeaways:
  - Investing in oneself is a valuable and memorable experience. Reading prompts thinking and can lead to important insights.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  The worst thing is we'll get out of this. Our student, the worst thing we'll get out of this is that we'll have memories of having gone for it to give ourselves the experience of participating in what Bill Hewlett and David Packard did to start a company. So rather than invest in better cars or better apartments or bank accounts, we decided to invest in ourselves. And so when I read this section, this is the first thing again, like when I'm reading, I think I told you this before, but I just read whatever when I'm reading books, whatever pops out. I'm like, I want to remember, I just highlight. I don't sit in like contemplated, just all instinct. Like, oh, this is interesting. I want to remember this. And then immediately I write down the first thing that pops to mind. You can never predict when you hear a line, you know, on a podcast or you read it in a book or hear in a movie. Like what? That's like a prompt for your thinking, right? This paragraph that I just read prompted this thought. One thing that reading biographies of dead people will do for you. It will remove the illusion that you have something to lose. If you want to design calculators at HP, then do that. But if what you really want to do is to try to start a company, you're making a giant mistake playing it safe. Everything is temporary. There is no such thing as safety. Then we see another email that he drafts for himself for the commencement address. This is another one of my favorite ideas and something that, you know, is going to happen when you become friends with the eminent dead. And it's important to obviously pick that up before, you know, we're one of them. ([Time 1:49:59](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7217bc3f-5b38-472e-b986-0821aa3b29b5))
    - **Note:** Everything is temporary there is no such thing as safety.
- Designing a Good Day
  Key takeaways:
  - Design your day to your liking and do what you love every day to build value for others and yourself.
  - Focus on designing a good 24 hours for yourself and keep doing it day after day.
  - Ask yourself if you want to do what you're about to do today, and if the answer is no for too long, make a change.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  We get confused with prestige and money and expectations of others. It doesn't matter. I'm a very... My wife wouldn't agree with this, but I'm a very simple person. And it says, it's like, I just try to design a day that I like. Did I like what I did today? And if I did, then let me do that again tomorrow. And if I find work that I love to do, and I do it every day, and I do it over a long time, that means I'll get really good at it. And then I'll be able to build value for other people and collect some of that value for myself. So it's like, very simple. It's like 24 hours. That's all. I don't worry about 5-year plan, 10-year plan, 20-year plan. It's like, can I design a good 24 hours myself and then keep doing that day after day? So it's very similar to what he's saying here. If today was the last day of my life, what I want to do what I'm about to do today? When the answer has been no for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something in my life. Another way to think about this is that your life is a story. It's hard to see that when you're looking forward at 22, which is the intended audience for what he's writing here. But imagine yourself as an old person looking back on your life. Your life will be a story. It will be your story with its highs and lows, its heroes and villains, its forks in the road that mean everything. And if you can remember that your life is a story in the making, it'll help you make important decisions. And so then there's just a few things that I want to pull out from the actual commencement address at Stanford University. There's something I actually save on my phone because I think what Steve's about to tell us here is very similar to this. ([Time 1:52:08](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0eecf5e1-86cd-40d9-8afe-fca3260e5e3d))
    - **Note:** Remember your life is a story in the making every day.
- The Importance of Learning for the Sake of Learning
  Key takeaways:
  - Learning for the sake of learning is important
  - Taking a calligraphy class led to the design of the Mac's beautiful typography
  - Intensely pursuing interests can lead to significant contributions in work
  - Following passions and time invested carry significant weight in success
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  He was interested in the time of taking a calligraphy class. Remember, he's dropped out. He's not a student. He's just learning for the sake of learning, which obviously is way more important than learning for the sake of formal education. None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful topography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would never have had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, it's likely that no personal computer would have them either. Again, you cannot connect the dots looking forward. That's why I think following something you're intensely interested in. Like maneuver yourself into your work that you are intensely interested in and then do it for a long time. That combination, like time carries most of the weight as long and the way you stay in something long is like you're intensely interested about it. Steve was intensely interested in building products when he was like 19. He was still intensely interested in it doing the same thing when he was 50. Again, that's why we're talking about it today. Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward. You can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something. You've got your destiny, life, karma, whatever. Because believing that the dots will somehow connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart even when it leads you to off the well-worn path. And that will make all of the difference. And then later on in the speech, he goes back to this theme that like if you know that your temporary everything that you think matters, people's opinions of you, none of that, none of it matters. It's just like what do you want to do? Your time is unlimited. Don't waste it living someone else's life is one of the best pieces of advice anybody could give you. Sometimes life is going to hit you in head with a brick. Don't lose faith. I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going after you got fired from Apple and struggled for 12 to 13 years was that I loved what I did. You've got to find what you love and that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life. And the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And like any great relationship, it just keeps getting better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking. Don't settle. Your time is limited. Do not waste it living someone else's life. ([Time 1:55:58](https://share.snipd.com/snip/42cc2018-1fb0-4213-b8c1-0ac96a532fef))
    - **Note:** Do what your intensely interested in. You can’t connect the dots looking forward only looking back. Work forever that feels like play. Life is short don’t settle living someone else’s life. Attack markets with second rate products.
