- Promoting Expertise-Based Influence in Investment Decisions
  Summary:
  The key insight is that in the context of investments, it is important to flatten power dynamics so that influence is based on expertise rather than tenure or hierarchy.
  To achieve this, anonymous voting is conducted at the outset of investment conversations to prevent gravitation towards the views of senior members. Additionally, efforts are made to ensure that longer-tenured individuals speak last to avoid swaying the discussion.
  By implementing strategies such as anonymous voting and encouraging diverse perspectives, the focus shifts towards individual performance and fostering the best ideas, regardless of seniority.

  And that's not actually a good thing because any given investment is likely to be unique. And maybe it rhymes with some of the things that you've seen in the past, but it's not going to be the same as what you've seen in the past. And so you want to try to flatten those power dynamics as much as possible so that when you get into an investment conversation, influence is a function of expertise, not a function of Tenure or power or some other corrosive dynamic. And so the little things that we do to support that, when we make an investment or when we're having an investment conversation, at the outset, we take a vote that is anonymous, so that You don't know who likes it and who doesn't like it, so that you can't just gravitate toward the point of view of whoever has been around for a while. Generally speaking, the order of operations and a part of being is the people who have been around for a while tend to speak last so that they don't end up swaying the conversation. We had a big strategic conversation about five years ago, where each person on our investment team wrote a memo that was their vision for Sequoia in 2030. And then we took the names off of all the memos and voted on it. Because again, we wanted the best ideas to not whoever happened to have been around for a while. There are a lot of little things that we do to try to reduce those power dynamics and to try to flatten the partnership. And I think the result of that is that the pressure is on every one of us individually to perform. ([Time 0:07:17](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b33fe8dc-4f7e-4573-9c3c-8a377d7a8e61))
    - **Note:** Create anonymous voting to reduce power dynamics and make it about the ideas not the person. Keep things simple and straightforward to cultivate trust. Part of investing is truly seeing people. Service mindset best investment memo is 3 not 12 pages. Everything that’s good everything that’s bad then the so what. Optimize for clarity and understanding not how smart you feel or are.
