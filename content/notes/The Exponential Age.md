### Highlights

- Automation for the moment has only led to more jobs not less this might change in the future. Job loss from automation has come more from the competitors of firms that automate than the automating firm itself
    - **Tags:** #future-of-work, #ai, #autonomy
    - **Note:** Automation leads to more jobs.
- With the super company the consumer doesn’t feel as much of the pain as other producers ie 3rd party app developers on the App Store get charged 30% by Apple. Monopoly in the new age exists but manifests differently
    - **Tags:** #monopolies, #exponential-growth, #demand-aggregation, #aggregation-theory, #own-the-distribution, #platform-businesses
    - **Note:** The platform businesses create a supply side monopolistic power given their demand side monopoly. Own the distribution and drive the market.
- Super companies benefit from network effects which are positive extranalities. The best businesses are marketplaces who own the relationship and do not offer anything substantive more than being the middle man
    - **Tags:** #network-effects, #marketplace-business
    - **Note:** Power of network effects and marketplace businesses
- Institutions are inherently slow to change and exponentials are tough to predict in both directions. Ie self driving cars proved too hard in 2020 but solar power increased exponentially in the 10 years before. We have trouble seeing things as exponentials because we mostly view the world as linear. Two tiers of those who embrace technology and those who don’t

    - **Note:** human's have a tough time understanding exponential growth and thus we underrate how quickly the future will change. Identify and exploit exponential tech. People reject technology because they’re scared or something.
- Exponential stacked on exponentials leads to a lalapoloza effect
    - **Tags:** #exponential-growth, #lolapoloza-effect
- Moore’s law is a function of time a doubling every 2 years wrights law says there will be a doubling after the production of x items. The second progress is the output of experience tracks more closely to how the world behaves. The more you produce the better you get at things v
- Computing biology energy and manufacturing are undergoing an exponential change currently. These are all general purpose technologies so they don’t just enable one thing like the lightbulb but many like the car. These changes go through phases first with a build up phase ahead of a widespread deployment phase. You need to first craft the gas stations before everyone will start driving cross country but once everyone does that you can building hotels and weekend get always and street restaurants. Then it leads to suburbs and reorders cities eventually it becomes widespread. Electricity took 50 years to be in use smartphones were incented in the 90s but took until the late 2000s for the iPhone and years after that for widespread adoption

    - **Note:** Technologies need time to mature install and grow and in the front years exponential technologies don't look like anything but then they reach escape velocity and you have this complex adaptive system. You need to build the firm foundation then let 1000 flowers bloom. Emergent systems. Compounding grows slowly then all at once emerges. You need to construct tech and infrastructure to enable different innovations
      First comes the innovation then the wider system. Power of compound growth.
- Manufacturing has been about subtraction going from rock to less rock wiry 3rd printing it’s now additive
    - **Tags:** #sculpting-vs-painting
    - **Note:** Sculpting is finding the sculpture in the rock and painting is creating the art on a blank canvas.
- For energy batteries are decreasing at an exponential rate for storage cost while energy price is getting exponentially cheaper
    - **Tags:** #exponential-growth
- Technology follows an S curve but some cornea are steeper than others. The adoption that it took for everyone to have electricity lasted 60% of the average household while it took Facebook only 20%. We live in a time where the pace of exponential change is getting greater and that’s creating a strong positive feedback loops that pushes expansion further at a faster pace. Spread of MySpace vs spread of tik tok
    - **Tags:** #s-curves, #exponential-growth, #compounding, #feedback-loops
    - **Note:** Technology is shaped by S curves and the pace of technology is getting steeper
- We’re living through a time of higher technological change than normal. Moments of radical changes called phase transitions. The rapid reorganization of our society is a phase change. We’re witnessing right before our eyes
    - **Tags:** #decisive-moments, #technology-(embrace-it), #phase-transition, #inflection-points
    - **Note:** Were at a the critical point in society or technological changes, speeding up, provides challenges and opportunities. At a technological inflection point.
