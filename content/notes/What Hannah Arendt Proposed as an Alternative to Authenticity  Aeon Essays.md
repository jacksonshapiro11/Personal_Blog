- Category: #articles

- Summary: Samantha Rose Hill explores the concept of authenticity, contrasting Heidegger's idea of the true self as found in solitude with Jaspers and Arendt's views that emphasize our existence within a community. While Heidegger suggests that authenticity requires stepping away from others, Arendt argues that our choices and actions shape who we are in relation to the world. Ultimately, she asserts that the will, not a hidden true self, defines our autonomy and freedom in navigating everyday life.

### Highlights

- For Heidegger, there was a difference between what is translated as ‘Being’ (with a capital B) and ‘being’ (with a lower-case b). This distinction does not indicate a transcendent Being, the way capitalising the ‘g’ in God does, but rather the fact that one is not always merely a being among beings. Or, to put it another way, Being means that there is a truer version of the self, a more authentic version, that can be experienced only when one steps out of the flow of everyday life, what Heidegger called ‘everydayness’. And when we experience this Being, we do not just experience our common lives, we experience everything that being human means – including our own inevitable death, that part of ourselves – our nonexistence – that otherwise remains hidden from our consciousness.

- In the midst of the Second World War, French existentialism emerged out of German existentialism. If authenticity was a question of being for Heidegger and a question of freedom for Jaspers, for Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and Albert Camus it became a question of individual ethics. The underlying question shifted from ‘What is the meaning of Being?’ to ‘How should I be?’ The credo underpinning Sartre’s work – ‘existence precedes essence’ – meant that we are thrown into the world without any fixed substance, and this meant that we get to choose who we become. While philosophers like Thomas Hobbes and Jean-Jacques Rousseau tried to capture human nature by imagining what life was like before society, for Sartre, there is no human nature. We must always be imagining and reimagining who we are, which is to say we are always in the process of becoming. For Beauvoir, becoming was a creative enterprise, a work of art. And she argued that it was not enough to shape oneself within the existing conditions of the world, but that one must also shape the conditions of the world itself. Authenticity for the French existentialists was not about uncovering a pre-existing true self, but rather choosing to engage in a process of becoming.

- for Arendt, the will was the means to our freedom, it was the promise that we can always be other than we are, and so to the world. The will is a space of tension inside the self where one actively feels the difference between where they are and where they would like to be.
  > The will is the only intervention we have against the conditioning of worldly existence
  Willing is the mental activity that goes on between thinking and judgment. It has the power to shape us by drawing us into conflict with ourselves. Without inner conflict, there is no forward movement. These are the basic principles of willing:
  • Willing is characterised by an inner state of disharmony.
  • Willing is experienced as a felt sense of tension within the body where the mind is at war with itself.
  • Willing makes one aware of possible decisions, which creates a feeling of being pulled in multiple directions at once.
  • Willing can feel very lonely. Decisions and choices are shaped by one’s environment, by the everydayness of being, but ultimately the responsibility for deciding is up to oneself.
  • Willing makes one aware of the tension that exists between oneself as a part of the world, and oneself as an individual alone existing in relationship to the world.
  • Willing is the principle of human individuation.
  • Willing relates to the world through action.
  • The will is the inner organ of freedom.
  Everyone makes hundreds of decisions a day, but most of the time they aren’t conscious of the decisions they are making. Their decisions are not subjected to the will. Instead, they are simply following a routine of patterns that have been formed over time. In order to engage the will, one must be willing to pause. Because, while thinking moves from past experience, and imagination fixates on what might happen in the future, the past and the future are beyond the reach of the will. Willing is what happens before one acts. To be in a state of willing is to be in the Now. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3xyn8xazy64zjgvpfq0xa1k))
    - **Note:** Willing and authenticity. Willing is the tension between who you are and who you want to be. The process of action in which you realize and achieve that
- A few months later, Arendt went to study with Jaspers at the University of Heidelberg. She cut her hair, started smoking, and found a group of friends. She found stillness in her solitude, and a sense of self-belonging in Heidelberg, as she learned to keep company with herself in the quiet moments. She would always be different, but instead of experiencing her difference as something that isolated her from others, it became the foundation for how she came to love the world of being with others. Loving the world, she realised, was a choice, and an act of willing, and the beauty of being together is that one is always coming undone in the dance of knowing and unknowing.
