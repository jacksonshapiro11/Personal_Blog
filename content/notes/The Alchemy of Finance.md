  - his obsession with his fund
  - his living organism
  - back aches when it was about to decline in value
  - what part of his theory, what uncertainty, is wrong
- currency markets:
  - relative importance of speculative transactions tends to increase during lifetime of self-reinforcing trend
  - the longer the trend exists the strong the bias becomes
  - trend will run its full course
  - currency value moves tend to happen in large waves, each move lasting several years
- his real time experiment:
  brink model vs. boom/bust model
  - intervention of authorities fail to produce a lasting reversal to trend boom/bust cycle
  1. past excesses are not liquidated but merely contained, continue to fester
  2. orderly correction or containment may not be sufficient to bring about a decisive reversal in the prevailing bias (banks continued path until 1982
  - the impact on the two factors varies from case to case
  - no clear cut cyclical pattern
  - some trends are genuinely reversed
  - some go into temporary remission
  - others manifest themselves in different forms
  - 1984: when bank regulations tightened regulations many of the risks were transferred to the financial markets
  - system could break down accidentally or gradually work way out of excess and stop from going to the brink
  - both budget and trade deficits have accumulated since 1982
  - I learned that there are a lot of factors that impact the broader markets on a day to day basis
  - One needs to have a view on both the short term of the markets, as well as a longer term view in order to properly position and leverage the portfolio beyond just the intra day perspective
  - things that point to on the brink of collapse
  - Japanese markets have long failed to correspond to traditional funadmentals
  - excessive price/earnings ratios, even in relation to low/declining interest rates
  - industrial profits outlook poor
  - and companies use surplus cash to speculate in the stock market
  - further decline of the dollar
  - reported earnings of companies artificially inflated by profits of stock transactions
  - Japanese market
  - fueled by liquidity
  - generated by a weak economy and a strong yen
  - holders of the dollar converting to yen, some find way into stock market
  - especially when supplied by the central bank to keep exchange rate from rising
  - decline could be positive on the market as a whole as people move money out of Yen and Japanese markets and to other assets
  - government encourages investment abroad
  - capital outflows exceed trade surplus
- - participants and their active thinking are a large part of the market
  - participants influence and affect each other
  - their thinking does not relate to facts, only to events in which they particpate
