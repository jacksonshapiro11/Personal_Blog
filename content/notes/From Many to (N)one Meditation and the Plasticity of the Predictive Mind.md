- Summary: This paper explores how meditation affects the brain as a predictive organ and aims to provide a unified understanding of the empirical and phenomenological effects of deconstructive meditation practices grounded in predictive processing. It discusses how different styles of meditation gradually reduce counterfactual abstract processing, leading practitioners into the present moment and unraveling hierarchical predictive processing in the brain. The document suggests that meditation techniques such as focused attention, open monitoring, and non-dual meditation work on a continuum, breaking down ingrained expectations and reducing the temporal depth of mental activity. The paper also highlights the potential of meditation to modulate prediction formation, prediction error signaling, and the sense of self across various meditation styles.

### Highlights

- For example, during FA meditation, one engages attention (increases precision) of a *specific* prediction at earlier levels of the predictive hierarchy (e.g., the breath). With practice, one can sustain attention on the same prediction for a longer period of time while decreasing the frequency and relative precision of predictions higher in the hierarchy. When one practices OM, different predictions will still arise in experience but are assigned lower precision, as illustrated by smaller and lighter ovals. With ongoing practice of OM, predictions arise less frequently and become less ‘sticky’, thus also disappearing faster. Increasingly experiencing without appraisal (an earlier level of the predictive hierarchy) dominates as predictions, or contents of experience, become less relevant and capture attention less. Finally, during ND meditation, the awareness inherent in experience becomes the foreground. In FA and OM, predictions within experience are still the prominent event in experience. However, in the ND state, all contents of experience, as well as the subject of experience, fall away, and only awareness (without background or foreground) remains.

    - **Note:** presence is about losing track of the thinking mind and bringing the being mind forward. We are no longer making judgements or assessments we are just experiencing the situation. the more we predict and let our life be run by the predictive thinking mind the less happy we are. The more we can remain present the more we can be in the now. True meditation is getting rid of prediction and just experiencing presensce
- Cognitive [neuroscience](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/neurosciences) is undergoing a kind of Gestalt switch, from an understanding of the brain as a vessel that ‘drinks in’ the world, to an organ that repeatedly regurgitates the world through predictions derived from the past. This view of experience—as deeply contrived through past learning—is remarkably similar to Buddhist ideas of the conditioned nature of experience, as the above quote illustrates. Moreover, the gradual breaking down of concepts in Buddhist meditation maps on strikingly well to the notion of the predictive model-building brain.
