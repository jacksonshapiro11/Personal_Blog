### Highlights

- CEOs and Founders: The Genghis Khan's of Our Time
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  I've been thinking a lot about, I think this is David Senra saying that the CEOs and the founders of these companies that we cover, that he covers, they are the Genghis Khan's of our time. And Phil doesn't present as a Genghis Khan. Yes. But he still is. Right. Deep down underneath all that introvert, he has that same drive that John Rockefeller had that an Elon Musk has that a Mark Zuckerberg has.
  Speaker 1
  And this unbelievably competitive spirit is the founding element of Nike's culture that permeates to this day. At Nike, you play to win. And I think everyone shows up to work and you wear Nike stuff and you don't ever wear any of the competitors. Not to, hey, I want to try out this stuff. It's like, hey, we don't do that here. That's playing for the other team. Get off the other team. You're on our team and you wake up every day and you show up to go to work and kick your competitors asses. And sometimes that takes them to questionable places that we'll talk about later in the episode. But Nike is among the most competitive cultures in the world.
  Speaker 2
  It's funny you say Nike there as sort of founding principles because Nike isn't going to come for quite a while here. Well, Phil is making this train trip down to Kobe. He suddenly has a realization. ([Time 0:19:14](https://share.snipd.com/snip/bef3f0a4-9f16-48a1-9b43-b0930b460a43))
    - **Note:** Phil knight is incredibly introverted runs for bowerman at Oregon and there bowerman learns cobbling so he can experiment on his runners. Phil is a big test subject. Phil becomes super passionate about shoes and travels the world. Despite being a massive introvert takes a train to a massive Japanese shoe maker the big producers outside of Germany at the time and lays it on the line showing how relentless he can be. Founder mentality to the max and absolute killer. He goes to Japan with nothing but claims to have a shoe exporting business and that the us market is 1bn. Performance of a lifetime all lies but it works. He becomes a distributor for 13 states and quits his job as an accountant literally driving up the western us selling shoes.
- Struggles with Banks and Teaching Accounting: The Origins of Shoe Dog
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  It's basically factoring is what it's known as today. Right. So yeah, as you can imagine, there are quite a lot of struggles with the various banks in Oregon and it's all very well chronicled in shoe dog. So since growth is literally rate limited by the banks, Knight decides that he can't justify taking a salary. He goes back to being an accountant by day. He joins Price Waterhouse in the Portland office. He does that for a couple years. Having years, years takes a long time to grow this thing. Eventually, Blue Ribbon does become big enough and he needs to devote enough time to it that he can't be a full time accountant. So instead, he gets a job teaching accounting at Portland State where he meets two women, both of which will change his life. The first one is a student. I mean, things were different in the 60s. A student in his first class that he teaches named Penny Parks, who he sees has a great potential as an accountant. So he hires her as a bookkeeper part-time while she's a student, I believe, for Blue Ribbon Sports. Very shortly thereafter, she becomes Penny Knight, his wife. Now I think of, gosh, like 60 years maybe, something like that. The other woman he meets is an art student, not an accountant. ([Time 0:40:42](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8a6ce565-d175-4a19-b855-26f57046b062))
    - **Note:** Jim Johnson as a legendary first mike employee. He’s an actual beast and just loves it. He has bad gross margins and banking is so backwards he can barely get a loan so he goes back to being an accountant. Bowerman writes a book on jogging which is anyone can run even knight thinks it’s crazy but it basically launches the anyone can run movement. The banks won’t fund them they try to ipo but it won’t work so they fund through Japanese trading companies. They need a flywheel of cash because they’re buying inventory up front. A constant tenant of this story is how much Phil knight will stretch the truth. He is constantly committing near crimes to real crimes to get this done and constantly on the edge of failure. He also went to get the shoes manufactured and he found a place that didn’t tell him 2 weeks but took him out to lunch and had the prototype ready. He hired them and asked for red boxes that popped.
- Nike's Expansion into College Athletics
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  So within a month of working on this, Strasser and Vaccaro have got UNLV, Georgetown, Texas, Arkansas. They get legendary coach Jimmy V at Iona to sign up to be committed to being Nike coaches and their teams wearing Nike. This is hilarious. So all this is happening. The Washington Post gets word of this. They run a real pearl-clutchy article saying that this is shameful. Nike is commercializing the purity of college athletics. Like, oh my God, give me a break. Like these kids are being exploited. Like at least they're getting free shoes here now. In the article, the post mistakenly says that Iowa is one of the colleges that Nike has signed up, not Iona. So Lud Olsen, the coach at Iowa, who's legendary, he goes on and coaches at Arizona. The listeners probably know who Lud Olsen is. He's in the Hall of Fame now. Instead of being pissed off that he was included in this shameful article with the post, he calls up Nike and he's like, yo, can I get an illness? So then they signed up, looted Iowa and then Arizona and he becomes a big Nike coach. It's incredible. Strasser then takes the same playbook to college football. He signs all the big coaches in schools, all the big powerhouses for peanuts. This is incredible. Selling football cleats is never a big business for Nike, but college football is huge. ([Time 1:52:42](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f595aef2-64f2-4e1f-a771-7c8822ae18df))
    - **Note:** Rob strasser comes in and he has the idea to sign up nba and college teams to get the Nike brand out there. They use the shoes as billboards and this drives brand equity which is free marketing.
- Nike Principles: Cheap, On Offense, Perfect Results, Battle of Business, Assume Nothing, Live Off the Land, Job Is Done, Dangers, It Won't Be Pretty, Making Money Automatically
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  All right.
  Speaker 2
  Nike principles. According to Rob Strasser in 1977, one, our business is cheap. Change. Two. Oh, this is so good. We are on offense all the time. Three, we already alluded to perfect results count, not a perfect process. Break the rules. Fight the law. Number four, this is as much about battle as about business. Five, assume nothing. Make sure people keep their promises. Push yourselves. Push others. Stretch the possible. Number six, live off the land. Number seven, your job isn't done until the job is done. Eight dangers with a underlying as a heading, bureaucracy, personal ambition, energy takers versus energy givers, knowing our weaknesses. Don't get too many things on the platter. Number nine, it won't be pretty. And then number 10, if we do the right things, we'll make money damn near automatic. It's so good. What's so good? The last one is so spot on for any business through to this day. It's so easy to get wrapped up on all the other crap. You do the right things. You make product that customers love. You market it right. You build a brand. You will make money damn near automatic.
  Speaker 1
  So I read these differently than I used to read them because when I didn't know Nike's journey, I sort of would just read them and be like, yeah, that's awesome. We're like, wow, that's so pithy. I can't believe their official corporate values are in such a pithy way. So this is stream of consciousness all from Rob Strasser, all into the typewriter. ([Time 2:04:30](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8a783af1-073e-4e4c-b139-5bc5a8427105))

- Nike's Marketing Opportunity with Michael Jordan and the Air Jordan 1
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  And he's a kid. Yes. So again, like this is all normal today. Everybody understands this. LeBron knew exactly what he was getting into when he signed with Nike out of high school and went to the NBA. But like this was the beginning of all of this.
  Speaker 1
  So why did they sell so well? That's sort of this interesting $126 million in the first year. Like, why was the demand for them crazy? Did people just love Michael Jordan? Nike, this is, I think the first time they really flex their ability to recognize an opportunity for an incredible marketing moment. So back in 84, Jordan starts wearing in preseason and in warmups, some modified airships because Nike is actually not done making the air Jordan one yet. And so he's wearing these black and red shoes that are now called the Jordan breads, B-R-E-D. And these shoes are black and red. And in the NBA, you wear white and that's it. And so Jordan's getting ready to play in the league with these black and red shoes, which again, he hasn't actually worn on court. And to this day, no one can find footage ([Time 2:26:53](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f900caae-c5f3-4c10-a2c8-21bdbcc98ba7))
    - **Note:** Nike budgeted 3mm in sales of the jordan sneakers and year 1 made 126mm. This creates the first shoe endorsement and superstar. Jordan got royalties. Nike had nothing to lose. No other players had the signature shoe deal. They also made it red which was a banned color so Jordan got fined and Nike paid it. Genius marketing. Jordan 2s we’re just bad and he wanted to go to adidas Nike brought in an architect who cared what jordan wanted in specs he listened intently and built the shoe jordan wanted this won him over and kept him. They listened and delivered on their promise. Jordan is literally making 300mm a year off shoes.
- Nike's products worth more than $500 and their charitable stunt
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  And yet, Nike absolutely produces many items that are worth way more than $500. Right.
  Speaker 1
  And like, it's not even a high number. It's not like, oh, I can't buy something from Nike for $10,000. Like I really can't think of a single thing I could possibly purchase for them, even for $500.
  Speaker 2
  Right. And the product that I know of was the mags, the back to the future shoes that they actually produce. But those were for Michael J. Fox's charity. I think they made 50 of them and sold them for $17,000 if I have that right. But A, that was for charity. B, that was like obviously a stunt. That's not Louis Vuitton.
  Speaker 1
  All right. Here's what I can buy for $490. I can get American and National League jerseys for the all-star game. And they have some football shoes that cost $300. Curious. Wow. Crazy. But the point still stands. They make it up in volume.
  Speaker 2
  Yes. I really can't think of anything else off the top of my head where a company is making such a obvious and clear choice to give value to other players in the ecosystem. Yeah. Whether there's be companies or just people who are arbitraging. Yeah.
  Speaker 1
  Just like a luxury brand, they have to market the dream. But their mechanism for capturing value is entirely different. Yep. Okay. ([Time 3:00:29](https://share.snipd.com/snip/24be5a44-83df-4939-b223-3c4174364358))
    - **Note:** Nikes shoes sell on the secondary market for 5k but they sell it for a few hundred intentionally not capturing a lot of value as a means of strategy.
- The Challenges Facing Under Armour and the NBA
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  I have to wonder the other shoe companies who are still doing big deals in the NBA. Let's take Under Armour and Steph Curry here in San Francisco. What are they doing?
  Speaker 1
  Name another Under Armour athlete.
  Speaker 2
  I mean, they exist, but I don't think I could, right? Why? And obviously, it's worth it to Steph. Steph could sign with Nike tomorrow, but Under Armour is just paying him a boatload of cash. And I think also gave him tons of equity in the company and whatnot. But why?
  Speaker 1
  I mean, I just think it's a bad move for Under Armour. I think this is the classic thing that we've talked about in 11 different industries of don't get caught in the middle and the age of the internet. It's so obvious in media. It's becoming obvious in universities, but be the New York Times or be acquired, but don't be the Cleveland Plain dealer or be Disney or be Doug DeMiro. Or in this world, be Brooks or be Nike. Right. But don't be Under Armour who's not a platform brand. They don't have the size and scale and everything that accrues to a Nike, but they're trying to run a mini Nike playbook and they need to run a completely different playbook.
  Speaker 2
  Yeah. Totally agree.
  Speaker 1
  So Nike is just leaning into this in a big way. They're now the official uniform supplier of the MLB, the NFL and the NBA. And they're throwing huge dollars. Like the NFL deal alone is something like a $200 million a year deal. ([Time 3:26:20](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4a17082e-8e0a-4da7-8f26-ba4896928557))
    - **Note:** Don’t get caught in the middle in the age of the internet. Be a scale player or differentiate in your niche but taking on the scale player subscale is a bad idea. Your greatest strength is your weakness Nikes overseas manufacturering fucked them but it also was their core competency. They are a fabless shoe company. Nike was a story of leverage where one misstep would’ve led to it all crumbling. It’s survivorship bias in some ways. He kept betting the farm and shot the moon and it worked. Athletes are Netflix shoes.
- The Evolution of Athletes as Billboards and Heroes
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  And these days, especially in the beginning, it was athletes are billboards and Netflix shows in that, you know, on SportsCenter or whatever, like you're going to see the swoosh. Now with social media and the modern world, it literally is a Netflix show. People are following, you name it, Patrick, from a home, Serena Williams, they have a following who are following their lives like a reality TV show.
  Speaker 1
  You want to hear an insane quote that dates all the way back to 1983. Rob Strasser wrote this in an internal memo. People athletes, even more than teams, will be the heroes. Symbols, more and more of what real people can't do anymore. Risk and win.
  Speaker 2
  Yes. I see your Rob Strasser quote and I will one up you a Phil Knight quote.
  Speaker 1
  Give it to me.
  Speaker 2
  This is actually about Phil Knight in just doing it. Around the time Michael Jordan became a Nike guy, Phil Knight had finally begun to apply in full measure his hunch that if the general public could be helped to imagine great athletes as he imagined them as having implications of the very best that the human spirit had to offer, then those athletes would become like the heroes of old, the heroes in books and people would come to those heroes and listen to what they had to say.
  Speaker 1
  Yes, I love it. Made with the athletes sell the dream people will buy products. ([Time 3:39:25](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d90cd3a0-ddbc-475c-87b8-3efbfdaf7c29))
    - **Note:** Athletes as modern day heros.
