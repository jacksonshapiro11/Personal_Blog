### Highlights

- Episode AI notes
  1. Games can be differentiated by three key dimensions: information availability, luck, and skill.
  2. Hidden information in games impacts decision-making as players have to infer or guess.
  3. Games like poker have undisclosed information, while chess reveals all details openly.
  4. Information transparency is a significant factor in distinguishing games, along with luck and skill. ([Time 0:00:00](https://share.snipd.com/episode-takeaways/809450fc-2c62-4d81-b0cc-04752974c062))
- Distinguishing Games by Information, Luck, and Skill
  Summary:
  Games can be differentiated by three key dimensions: information availability, luck, and skill.
  Some games involve uncertainty where crucial information is concealed, leading players to infer or guess. This hidden information impacts decision-making.
  Games like poker have undisclosed information while chess reveals all details openly.
  This diversity in information transparency is a significant factor in distinguishing games, alongside luck and skill.

  Speaker 1
  People who aren't very familiar with games or who don't dwell on them probably think they're all variations on the same theme. But actually, there are big differences. I want to touch on them so I can go on to create an effective analogy between gaming, gambling, and investing. Importantly, games vary in three primary dimensions, information availability, luck, and skill. Some games, but not all, require players to deal with uncertainty. Whether you or your opponent will win or what action you should take might hinge on information that's not available to you, and about which you can make inferences or guesses at best. Thus, in some games, there's important hidden information, and in others, there isn't. In poker, blackjack, and gin, you don't know what courage your opponent is holding. But in chess and backgammon, everything's plain to see. The position of the playing piece is on the board. Nothing is hidden. Obviously, this is a big difference.

    - **Note:** Games combine information availablility luck and skill. Making decisions under uncertainty isn’t luck but great skill. You’re not making absolute bets but risk adjusted bets. Don’t pick winners but the best ev payout. Don’t buy good things buy things well. Know your strengths and you don’t need to play every hand bet big when you have an edge. You need to avoid wipe outs don’t die first then try to win. Use second level thinking and bernaise first don’t lose then win don’t make decisions on tilt hope or dispair. Think at higher levels of emergence. Follow a good processs that you shape but don’t trust it blindly. Understand what you do know what you should know and have a respect for what you don’t know you don’t know. Understand the significance of information you do and don’t have. Think pribablostically. And understand why you failed you’re not wrong or right based on outcomes. Were taking a chance or bet on an uncertain future across a range of outcomes. Skill wins in the long run but in the short run anyone can win. Were betting on possible but uncertain futures and we ultimately live in one area of the multiverse but we needs to respect the entire multiversal outcomes when assessing a decision.
      Best ev decision under uncertainty big when you have an edge. Skill wins in the long term but world is probablistic understanding the game you’re playing. Second level thinking.
