  And one of his questions was about you guys ship very quickly. Like you're shipping meaningful features every Friday. And you also close the loop really well with customers when I ask for something and you're like, hey, we did it. What is it that you do and what can people learn from the way you operate that allows you to ship quickly?
  Speaker 1
  Well, first of all, thank you, Scott, if you're listening. It's somewhat of an awkward question in Midgley because, of course, as the team, it's sort of like someone complimenting you about your product. It's almost impossible to really take and accept the complex. You know, blemishes. Of course, we see all these ways in which we don't ship fast enough and could be doing a better job listening and building with members. But at risk of sounding a bit cliche, I really think we ship our values. So we thought a lot about our values as a company. You can read about them online. And I think if you examine those values and then you look at your compliment or Scott's compliment, you can see them into one to one. So the first, and I really think the most important is we hire people that show up with heartfelt intensity. And a lot of companies, I think, obsess over craft details. You know, there'll be a value like we obsess over the details. What we say is we want people that show up to our company with some fire in their belly, something that they are out to do. At a very rich person, it's a little bit different. For some people, it may be UI craft details. For other people, it may be achieving double the performance with a quarter of the engineering head town. Everyone has something, but they show up with this heartfelt intensity. And I think even relative to everything else I'm going to say, that's it. If you have a team that has heartfelt intensity and is there for a purpose and something to prove, you get it. You give them a very exciting, ambitious product and get out of their way and they will do remarkable work. So showing up with heartfelt intensity, that our second value is assume you don't know. Assume you don't know. And the value assume you don't know is even if you know, even if you're a subject matter expert, we have some other company that literally built the first version of Chrome and ran it for 16 years. But he more than anyone embodies this beginner's mind of, I have no idea how this should work or what will happen. And the follow up to that value is, so we got to get going. It's like dropping in a new city. You just got to walk out the door of your Airbnb, turn left and maybe you'll turn right. And then you'll hop on the subway, but you just got to get going and see what you find. And so we have this attitude of you're showing up with this heartfelt intensity, but you start by saying, I've no idea what I'm doing. I have no idea what's going to happen. So we just got to get going. And that bias is in the default to action. We have another value of start by asking what could be, which is pushing ourselves to be as aspirational ambitious as possible. So the peak feature that you mentioned, we just didn't want to solve the problem of context, which we wanted to almost blur the line between native and web software and make it feel like a sheet of paper and really pushing ourselves to be as ambitious as we can be, which is the consequence of blowing back around and more deeply motivating of the people working on it. So I mean, I could keep going. We have a value. You're on the hook for the team about a collective, you're doing it for the crew when you got to swarm, when you got to swarm and we have a value of making them feel something. But I think what it all adds up to is a team that has a lot of heart, has a lot of intrinsic motivation and a it's the first day of my career. I wonder what's going to happen attitude. And I think all of those things add up to a culture, which is let's get something out there. Let's see what happens.
