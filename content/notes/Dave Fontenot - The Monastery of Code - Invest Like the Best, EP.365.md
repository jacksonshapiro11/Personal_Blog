### Highlights

- Episode AI notes
  1. In investing, it is crucial to support exceptional engineers who can attract other skilled engineers, as having a strong engineering team is a key competitive advantage.
  2. Founders are evaluated based on grit, storytelling ability, and product sense, especially their ability to quickly deliver end-to-end consumer-grade products.
  3. Successful teams have a unique planning approach that allows them to build and iterate their products rapidly.
  4. The firm's experience with hackathons helps in evaluating engineers' productivity, with top engineers demonstrating exceptional product sense being highly valuable in platforms like hf0. ([Time 0:00:00](https://share.snipd.com/episode-takeaways/78a5134c-447a-4bdf-8eee-9e399ec688b0))
- Seeking Brilliance in Engineering Teams
  Summary:
  The key focus in investing is to back brilliant engineers who can attract even smarter engineers, as having the best engineering team is the most defensible moat.
  Founders are assessed based on grit, storytelling ability, and product sense, gauged by their speed in shipping end-to-end consumer-grade products. The ability to quickly deliver such products distinguishes the top engineers, as most engineers lack the necessary skills due to the disconnect between contributing to large systems and shipping products efficiently.
  Successful teams exhibit a unique planning approach in terms of days, enabling them to rapidly build and iterate their products.
  Evaluating engineers' productivity is facilitated by the firm's experience with hackathons, where top engineers with exceptional product sense can achieve significant progress in a short time, thus making them highly valuable in a platform like hf0, which enhances their productivity exponentially.

  Speaker 1
  We're a people driven firm. We're not a thesis driven firm. We back the most brilliant engineers as early as possible. That's been my thesis from day one when I started investing. And so that's really what we look for is this brilliance. The word brilliant has this connotation of a light shining that other things are attracted to. And so really, my belief is that the only real defensible moat is having the best engineering team in the world. And so we really look for founders who are going to be able to attract even smarter engineers than themselves. That's the brilliance that we look for. And it's reflected in their writing. It's reflected in the way they communicate. It's reflected in the way they write code. It's reflected in the way their product feels. In terms of more specific things, the three things that we look for in founders that we think are the winning formulas, grit, storytelling ability, and product sense. And our heuristic for product sense is how quickly can the founding team ship end to end consumer grade product? I think actually most engineers can't. It doesn't matter how much time you give them. It's venture to say 90% of FANG engineers can't ship end to end consumer grade product. And it's not that they're bad engineers. It's that the skills required to contribute to a large system. And the skills required to ship end to end product as a small team are just disjoint. They don't teach this in school. And so we really look for the top engineers in terms of this, what we call product sense. A lot of the teams that get into hf0, I mean, people ask, oh, do you back teams before they have product or before they have idea that people who end up getting an hf0, even between applying And getting the interview, if they haven't built something, they probably don't build fast enough to get into hf0. Most of the teams in hf0, a lot of teams, especially bigger teams plan in terms of quarters, some startups plan in terms of months, some startups plan in terms of two-experence. The teams that get into hf0, they plan in terms of days. In two days, they can ship end to end product or end end feature and then changes. And so we're able to evaluate this better than anyone else because of our experience with hackathons. Well, usually a whole business can't be built in a hackathon. No one knows better than us what can actually be built in 24 to 48 hours. And actually for the top engineers with incredible product sense, so much can be built in 24 to 48 hours, especially when you're in continual flow state. So essentially, we look for the most brilliant engineers who are already the most productive engineers in the world, because our product, hf0, amplifies their productivity the most. If you're already one of the most productive, let's call 10x engineers, in the world, hf0 makes you 100x engineer. ([Time 0:28:19](https://share.snipd.com/snip/56fcb444-20e8-4d2e-9782-5f05584bbe37))
