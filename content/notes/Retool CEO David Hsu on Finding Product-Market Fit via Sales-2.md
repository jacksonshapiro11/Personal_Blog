### Highlights

- Underrated Importance of Sales for Startups in Early Stages
  Summary:
  Chen: Sales is, I think, pretty underrated in the early innings of a startup. He says most PLG-y companies existed for three or four years before they figured out how to scale up. "I wish we had talked to customers earlier instead of just developing the product in a garage," Chen said.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, I guess another way of phrasing it is I would probably say sales is, I think, pretty underrated in the early innings of a startup, where if you look at most PLG-y kind of companies, Figma, for example, or a Notion or an Airtable, those companies I think existed for three or four years. And they were, I think, by their own mission, kind of wandering around in the desert at the beginning, where they released a product that are like, okay, great. I think people were kind of using it, but I'm not sure how I need to pivot my product in order to attract more usage. And then I think after three or four years of iteration, they find, oh, here's the insight that really works and we can really scale us up. But that took four years. If you were to talk to customers earlier, you could not have Dylan about this. I think Dylan buys on a mission again would say, I wish we had talked to customers earlier instead of just developing the product in a garage, if you will. So I think sales is maybe underrated at the beginning of a startup because it tells you so much about how customers think about your space, how they feel about the problem, how they feel about your solution, et cetera. That is gold when you're a pre-part of our benefit.
  Speaker 3
  Were you doing all the sales? How did sales operate in early retool land? Yeah.
  Speaker 1
  So how it worked actually was everything was outbound at the beginning because before we had launched, I mean, no one knew about us. So there was no inbound. I don't want to go to our website. At that point, it was retooled.in. It was like retooled in. So no one unsurprisingly would have left side just retooling around. And the only way we knew how to get customers was by sending emails to them. That was another way, basically. So funnily enough, the first time I posted a retool to Hacker News, I think I called it something like show a Chen retool.

    - **Note:** Makes sales the vital early part of your start up process. Talk to customers understand what they want and have that be your guiding light to adjust to what the market demand and problems are.
- Challenging Counterarguments in Startup Ideas
  Summary:
  The classic pitch there is customer needs are so different from one another that it's actually very difficult to build a product that suits all of them well without ridiculous amounts of customization. So at this point, we're already selling to developers and people are like, so you're selling a low code platform to developers who already know how to code. Why don't you go democratize programming and enable non developers to be able to go build software? That's the bigger opportunity. A because there's a lot more of them. And because the need is a lot more acute because they actually can't do it.

  Speaker 2
  And the classic pitch there is customer needs are so different from one another that it's actually very difficult to build a product that suits all of them well without ridiculous amounts of customization. So no product opportunity. Exactly.
  Speaker 1
  Yes. So that was one counter argument. Another counter argument sounds actually pretty smart when you say it is. So at this point, we're already selling to developers and people are like, so you're selling a low code platform to developers who already know how to code. Why would a developer purchase that? Why don't you go democratize programming and enable non developers to be able to go build software? Well, really, that's the bigger opportunity. A because there's a lot more of them. And because the need is a lot more acute because they actually can't do it. And you're actually sort of, you know, really raising the bar, or is it an older one already do it already? So just doing it faster. Is that really that helpful? So, and I think that's kind of gets to the point where any successful startup idea probably has 10 reasons why I won't work. And because if it didn't, probably somebody would have done it already. And so you have to say, well, yes, I can see why you I believe a or B or C, but I actually disagree with you and I'm going to prove it out. And so for me, at least when I heard these stories, it was actually mostly motivating because great. Thank you for the input. I cannot wait to prove you wrong. ([Time 0:21:29](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0339af90-a807-4e28-9fa0-440a0cc9d9cc))
    - **Note:** All start ups have 10 reasons why it won’t work and very few why it will or it would’ve been done already.
- The Hard Part of Computer Science and Using Primitives in Retool
  Summary:
  In the same way that programming has data structures, retool has these primitives. At the end of the day, most internal facing tools consist of like five to eight very repetitive types of ways to display and input information. This is such a good point. And I always sort of end up at this place mentally, whenever I get excited about no code. It's just as complex if you are learning a visual syntax instead of a language based syntax. Totally.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  This is such a good point. And I always sort of end up at this place mentally, whenever I get excited about no code. And the place I always arrive to is the hard part about computer science is not the syntax. The hard part about computer science are the concepts. And if you have to represent all of the same mental models, it's going to be just as complex, and if you are learning a visual syntax instead of a language based syntax.
  Speaker 1
  Totally. Yeah.
  Speaker 2
  And in the same way that programming has data structures, retool has these, I don't know, you called them primitives earlier, but in your demo video, you can drag what looks like a table. You can drag what looks like a search box. At the end of the day, most internal facing tools consist of like five to eight very repetitive types of ways to display and input information. You said crowd operations earlier. ([Time 0:26:55](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f3b8345b-65ea-4aff-941a-c52eb52158a3))
    - **Note:** The hard part about cs is the concepts not the syntax.
- Insightful approach to customer outreach and sustainable growth for startups
  Summary:
  The second chapter of retool is about sustainable growth, which is sort of how do you grow quickly, but actually be casual positive. How do you scale up a go-to-market and an EPD engineering product design team while not being dependent on VCs was maybe another interesting one. Can we double click on that? One, I think that is probably highly relevant to people listening today in 2023. Yeah.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 3
  The customer wasn't reaching out to you. You just like, intuited from what you were seeing that they were having some problems.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah. And I think when we reached out to customers or as an early stage when we were first getting started, we were just basically no one wanted to talk to us because they're like, just go away. I'm a developer. I don't want to talk to you. Whereas if you reach out exactly whether using the product and just ran into an issue, they would love to talk to you. As an example, I think of sort of sales really paying a lot of like talking to customers right at the right time, really paying a lot of dividends because that would go fix the issue for them and be like, wow, this is like the best support experts I've ever had. Where before I even told anyone I had a problem, they knew I had a problem and they fixed it for me.
  Speaker 3
  I love this product. Great. Can I interest you in a renewal and expansion?
  Speaker 1
  Well, at that point, it was actually just starting the contract. So I think that's maybe one sort of customer acquisition at the beginning. I think the second chapter of retool is about sustainable growth, which is sort of how do you grow quickly, but actually be casual positive. How do you scale up a go-to-market and an EPD engineering product design team while not being dependent on VCs was maybe another interesting one.
  Speaker 3
  Yeah. Can we double click on that a little bit for two reasons? One, I think that is probably highly relevant to people listening today in 2023. ([Time 0:35:18](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8e2621b0-477b-4dab-8dde-de5a14093dab))
    - **Note:** Get to cash flow positive while growing at scale also answering customers questions before they ask.
- Reasons behind raising a series A for a potential billion-dollar startup
  Summary:
  We raised a series A from Sequoia. reason why that option was available was because we were small and we were actually making, you know, $35 billion in ARR. We genuinely, truly believe that a ritual could be the way that maybe something like 10, 20, 50% of all software is built in the future. But if we're able to do that, I think the opportunity is so, so, so large.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  The reason why that option was available was because we were small and we were actually making, you know, $35 billion in ARR. And if you do the math, even if you do not evenly amounts, everyone, which maybe is the fairest thing. And let's say you've moved Hawaii, you could actually live, you know, it's actually a pretty good life. And so we raised a series A from Sequoia. We did actually kind of think about that, which is, hey, you know, should we go raise a series A and actually go raise a VC dollars? Or do we just want this to be sort of a pretty good lifestyle business that could probably honestly grow another three, four, five X without any outside capital from here? The reason why we ended up raising that series of Sequoia was because we thought the opportunity was so much larger. We genuinely, truly believe that a ritual could be the way that maybe something like 10, 20, 50% of all software is built in the future. In order to achieve that, it's going to take really heavy sustained investments in the product on the go-to-market side to make that happen. But if we're able to do that, I think the opportunity is so, so, so large. And so for that reason, we decided to go raise more capital this series A. And for that reason, we decided to hire more people too. ([Time 0:42:40](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ead5e3ec-1e5f-4ad2-beda-5bbe437c33ff))
    - **Note:** They bootstrapped retool and was cash flow positive. Didn’t have a ton of venture money just seed then they decided the market was so big they needed to attach it at scale and had to raise venture money but it was really thoughtful.
- Making Significant Decisions in Business and Life
  Summary:
  Every day, I think we all make a lot of decisions. They are kind of low impact. A lot of them reversible. It doesn't really matter that much. The path I got all of us here comes down to probably five or 10 decisions you made in your life. Preparing yourself for those maybe three important decisions is important.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, this is a really fun topic. I was chatting with a few founder friends recently. We were discussing what are decisions that you made in your company that actually made a difference. In the sense that every day, I think we all make a lot of decisions. But to be honest, a lot of decisions are kind of low impact. They are a lot of them reversible. It doesn't really matter that much. I think the consensus we got to was every year, there's probably maybe three decisions that are actually important that you do to bake. The problem is you don't really know what those three are beforehand, but in retrospect, it generally is obvious. And I think maybe it's where to analogy, but I think in life, it's also similar to in life, you make a lot of decisions about do you have ice cream today or not, for example, but probably that doesn't matter that much. Probably the path I got all of us here comes down to probably five or 10 decisions you made in your life. And so I think preparing yourself for those maybe three important decisions is important. I think being very close to the business, so you understand at a very granular level what is going on. So you have a very firm grasp on reality. So you can increase the probability of making the right decision is also very important. ([Time 0:50:52](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2c461742-1038-4a21-a35c-5444b3c08d7b))
    - **Note:** Deep understanding of the business there will be very few decisions in your day and life that will define it, so you need to be very prepared for those subset of decisions. Prepare for the 3-5 decisions that matter most in a day.
- How Retool Prioritizes Customer Satisfaction Over Short-Term Revenue
  Summary:
  Pricing changes affect existing customers. "We care more about, can we genuinely change the trajectory of how software is being built today in the world," he says. Investors are also not here to say, Hey, let's go make a retool and sell the company; they're actually trying to grow the valuation.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  And does that mean your revenue could actually temporarily go down? Like, well, these pricing changes affect existing customers? It does.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah. In fact, we will be sending emails to customers saying, Hey, did you know your bill is now lower actually than before? And I myself have never received email like that before. But I think that's going to be hopefully incredibly energizing for customer to see. And hopefully, they'll actually tell their friends about retool. From our perspective, we care more about, can we genuinely change the trajectory of how software is being built today in the world, rather than can we maximize our revenue in 2023? And I think we're fortunate to have a board that is so supportive and investors that are so supportive of that, because they're also not here to say, Hey, let's go, you know, make a retool, let's go double the valuation, sell the company. No, the goal is actually to grow the valuation. Hopefully 10, maybe even 100 X or a real R today, even if it's, let's say, a 50% chance of that actually happening. So. ([Time 0:55:04](https://share.snipd.com/snip/bca1d0c8-53ce-4fa2-9e64-45b0d84df0bb))
    - **Note:** Retool is cutting prices not raising them to expand the install base and tam to attack the market more. Forfeiting 2023 revenue for 2033 revenue. Bet on growing the pie at a cheaper price for more value. This is important to note that without being cash flow opostive you don’t have the optionality to bet the company this way. Importance or good businesses and flywheels compounding.
- The limitations of communication through language
  Summary:
  The spectrum for information in the brain is much higher bandwidth than any given language. When I translate a thought into English, it is going through severe compression. And I am communicating that to another person for which they could misunderstand it. But we only have this lossy low bandwidth medium to communicate through with language.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  I had a very similar conversation recently where if two engineers send each other a pull request, it is exact what the communication is, like it is literally saying these are the instructions to a machine. Can you look at them to ensure that they are doing what this contract says that it should do? But if two people are having a conversation, at least this is my understanding, the brain's capability, the spectrum for information in the brain is much higher bandwidth than any given language. So when I translate a thought into English, it is going through severe compression. And I am communicating that to another person for which they could misunderstand it. Like a word could trigger a different emotion for someone else than I mean when I say it. And then they go through a decompression where they extrapolate that onto their brain. And it could light up a completely different set of neurons than was originally lit in my brain. But we only have this lossy low bandwidth medium to communicate through with language. ([Time 1:04:07](https://share.snipd.com/snip/75ca787b-8625-4d7b-8489-c9c2c8609b8d))
    - **Note:** Limits and complexity of using language to communicate the complex actions going on with our neurons using a transformation function.
