### Highlights

- Improving User Experience in DAO Voting Through Pairwise Small Decisions
  Key takeaways:
  - Pairwise is a voting system that prioritizes user experience in DAOs
  - Voting in DAOs can be difficult due to the need for context and public voting
  - Pairwise aims to simplify the decision-making process by breaking it down into small, individual decisions
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  To the broad stuff. So pairwise, tell me why what and how is pairwise. And why are you excited about it?
  Speaker 1
  Pairwise is voting with good UX, you know? That's the long and short of it. And voting in DAO's right now is just so painful. It's so painful. It's like, read all these forum posts, try to get context. Oh, and by the way, engage with the forum posts with that context and defend your opinions against everyone else. And, you know, it was going to push back. And if you have a disagreement, oh, and by the way, we're going to vote in public. I mean, there's just so many issues. And I'm not going to pretend that pairwise solves any of them. But all of them, I mean, but it's really trying to target the hardest piece, which I think is user experience. Most votes, because they require so much context, it's like you have a lot of things to understand and connect together. And then you have to make one simple but huge decision. And pairwise flips that around. We say, hey, make lots of small decisions, and that will aggregate into an understanding of the big decision. And that's what I want to do with voting in general in DAOs is like, can we just make voting more like signal aggregation? Make it really easy for community members, big or small, and make it easy and fun for community members, big or small to come in and just share their opinions, share their thoughts. Pairwise is kind of a first attempt at that. And there's going to be more, I promise. And I hope they don't all come from me. I hope they come from everybody. Because we've got to make it easier for us to gauge the interest of the community. And just want to be great if we could just automate taking those signals and direct the community in that direction. What pairwise is really best at is kind of a call of ring choice voting. It's like, OK, what is your favorite project? What is your second favorite? What is your third favorite? What is it most favorite? It can be project. It can be parameters. It can be NFTs. Whatever. It's kind of this curation. Instead of saying, OK, take the big list and then order them. Like, I was a steward for, were you a steward for retroactive public goods funding?
  Speaker 2
  I was a bad soldier in round two, yeah.
  Speaker 1
  And so we had to go through and put all of these percentages in the Excel spreadsheet for 195 projects. And it was hard. It was really, really difficult. And with pairwise, that would look so different. It would just be like, here's two projects. Which one deserves more retroactive public goods funding? Next two. Next two. Next two. And you're just making lots of small decisions. And then we have an algorithm that can be configured by one person who's really smart and wants to make it right. That will give out some results. And when you see those results, this feature doesn't exist. Yeah, but you should be able to switch them if they're not right. The cool thing here is it's iterative. You can make lots of small decisions. You can be just sitting on the toilet, basically, like picking your favorite projects for five minutes. And then, or 10 if you have an issues. And then move on. And we'll go back and forth.
  Speaker 2
  Did a little bit of research before this. And it looks like you can check out pairwise at pairwise.generalmagic.io. And the primary innovation is a voting user experience where you just kind of decide the left project to the right project. And then do that a bunch of times. And then you eventually get to rank all the different projects in the registry, kind of like ranked choice voting style. But one of the things that I really like is that people can only have to have a couple different things in their head at a time. Or as opposed to, like you said, with a retroactive public goods experiment, where we all had to decide which of 150 different projects deserve the retroactive rewards that have been done with pairwise, then it would just be very easy to look at tuples, which basically means pairs of two projects at a time. And maybe do that 15 or 20 times. And you get a ranked list of the whole registry. Is that close?
  Speaker 1
  Yeah. I mean, you might have to do it for 195 projects. You might have to do it a lot to get the whole registry. It's kind of one of these things where if we train the algorithm right, you know, you can kind of go back and forth. Maybe there's some projects that you want to just be like, I love these 10 projects. So you kind of see them with some initial percentages. But then there's also the project discovery process. You know, you get two projects and you're like, well, I like this one. What is that one? You know, you click it and you're like, oh, yeah, it's that thing. Yeah, yeah, I definitely like this one better. You know, and it's just like so much more digestible. And then when this project comes up against a project you don't like, you're like, oh, well, this one for sure. And then you just get all these choices. And we can train an algorithm basically to decide a percentage of allocation across the span. You just need one person who is configuring it like a snapshot boat. You need someone to make the snapshot strategy. And same with this one, you kind of need someone to decide like, you know, where do you draw the lines? And what's the default experience? If you get two projects and you don't know either of them you'll hit abstain. So there will be some configuration. And I assume that once we have this out we'll make like default patterns for people. Like for retroactive public goods funding. If you hit abstain, they should get zero percentages, you know? But maybe for other use cases you might want that. I really like pairwise because it's a very clear pattern. It's almost like Tinder UX, but for solving a complex thing just like Tinder does where it's like, well, who's going to be your mate? Well, or your date. And then, you know, you make lots of micro decisions.
  Speaker 2
  Well, I think those micro decisions are powerful in their simplicity. You know, Tinder invited that whole swipe right, swipe left experience. And I'm actually probably one of the only people in the world that there was this because I used to run an online dating website in my 20s. Not because I actually used Tinder. But yeah, what's really beautiful about what they've done is that the user experience of swiping left or swiping right is very simple. But then under the hood you can run some really powerful algorithms around that. There's this thing called collaborative filtering. And it basically is a way of saying, okay, if you swiped six times, then basically we can use clustering to know that you're like these other users. And these other users like these other products or like these other whatever. And you can use inference to sort of map preferences.

    - **Note:** Simplify dao voting by breaking it down into more bit size pieces like tinder or a comparison algorithm and do this 20 times and it makes the task much more reasonable.
