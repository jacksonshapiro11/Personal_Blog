- Certain secrets are unseen to the public and are left to be discovered. Ted kazinski thought there were no hard problems left and nothing to be discovered. We’re taught to learn incrementally ie taught to tests ect and not be be explorers and learn more than needed because there is nothing left to be discovered. But there is always a new frontier when you push hard enough. Take unorthodox ideas seriously don’t believe everything has been discovered and believe in yourself. If you think something hard is impossible you’ll never even try to achieve it. Secrets can be about nature or people

    - **Note:** There is still a ton of whitespace to discover new technologies and there is always a new frontier. Take crazy ideas serious and the word impossible should be your starting point to prove people wrong.
      There are secrets everywhere you need to be actively optimistic and crazy enough to look ask the crazy questions be inefficient in your search. Ignorance is bliss 
      believe in secrets you can change the world with yours. There’s always secrets and frontiers for explorers.
- The importance of power laws in VC most of the returns will come from a small subset of companies so you can only invest in companies that can return at minimum the value of the fund. Once you think that you’re playing the lottery you lose. Power laws only become clear overtime are tough to see in the moment. Because the best returns come from power laws you can’t diversify you need to concentrate. Make future decision based on your skills and where you can gain the most leverage ie don’t start a company but join a small company focus on strong concentrated areas of growth

      Power laws not lottery tickets and societal leverage
- Future is either definite or indefinite and optimistic or pessimistic. Definite you know what to do Indefinite means you don’t. Luck favors the prepared mimd. Indefinite pessimism Europe you don’t know the future but it’s gonna be worse definite pessimism China we know the future and it’s going to be worse indefinite optimism US current we have some idea what the future will be better I don’t know how so we keep our options open and just rearrange and getting an optimization from what we have without any new creation ie private equity . definite optimism as we know the future is going to be better and we’re going to build things and create in order to make it better. People overate chance and underate planning but this should be inverted

- Monopoly vs perfect competition if you have a monopoly you will make it seem like you’re in a more competitive space and likewise if you’re in intense competition you’ll pretend to have a niche monopoly. All successful companies succeed by solving a unique problem to add value while unsuccessful companies die because they are competed away

    - **Note:** Secrets there is always a new frontier and something to learn these secrets are obvious to you but unclear to others this is your unique differentiation. Make decisions based on your skills and secrets. VC returns are power laws but this is positive EV bets do not think you are playing the lottery or you're fucked. Power laws mean you should concentrate not diversify.
      This book is about using conjectures and refutations layering on active optimism and adding your unique differentiation
      Positive ev power laws and secrets drive the future. Don't learn incrementally trek on the frontier

- Secrets
  Certain secrets are unseen to the public and are left to be discovered. Ted kazinski thought there were no hard problems left and nothing to be discovered and this drove him crazy. Global Warming and doomsday theories have always rejected secrets and bet against humanity. This is because extrapolating from a current trend is incredibly easy but completely parochial.
  True progress comes from the Popperian/ Deutsch idea of good explanations and approaching the idea from a different way. Secrets and solutions through good explanations change the future and cannot be achieved through extrapolation. We’re taught to learn incrementally ie taught to tests ect and not be explorers or learn more than needed because there is nothing left to be discovered. But there is always a new frontier when you push hard enough.
  The solution to problems is different problems not stagnation. The solution to The Great Horse-Manure Crisis of 1894 was not to breed horses that poop less, to travel less, or a better sewer system; it was cars. Likewise, the solution to climate change brought about by cars, amongst a host of other factors, is not using less and changing human behavior, but using more to propel innovation. A creation of a different type of energy that can capture carbon at scale and generate cheap and clean energy. Creation is a positive sum game.
  This is not to say we aren’t running with a gun to our head or being chased by a bear, but humanity has encountered humanity threatening problems in the past that now are nothing more than a blip on the radar. be reduction in energy use but likely an increase in energy used from different sources

    - **Note:** Secrets are something that exist are waiting to be discovered by humans. There is always a new frontier and our world is perpetually unsustainable. We must look to the frontier and create new knowledge to achieve the dreams and goals we set. There is always a new frontier. We need to go long creation as all things are unsustainable. Don’t teach and learn incrementally but take moonshots and mental leaps. Creation is positive sum and hard problems are good problems.
      It’s always easier to extrapolate rather than innovate but we have to innovate and create new things. Reduction and sustainability is unsustainable so is maintaining the status quo. Were running with a gun to our head building a plane on the fly and we do this because we have to and we always succeed by new inventions not existing methods.
      Theres always a new problem/frontier you can’t optimize you need to create. Secrets always exist creation is the answer. Bet on emergence discover secrets through good explanations.

- The famous chart below from the book outlines societies in which definite optimism and pessimism are detailed. At a high level a definite optimist has a plan that will make the future better while an indefinite optimist believes the future will be better but does not have a concrete plan. Pessimism is the reverse of believe the world will be worse. The idea being that to create value you need to craft a plan and avoid as much diversification as possible. Economists/Academics believe in the value of diversification, but the hindrances are obvious. If you look at stock market returns at the end of the year and got to pick how you had invested the money, you would not pick a diversified portfolio of 100 companies you would just pick the one that did the best. While decisions are made with uncertain outcomes and diversifying idiosyncratic risk is beneficial it clearly is not optimal, but neither is definite optimism because as clear as picking the winner on Dec 31st is make the optimal bet on Jan 1st is not a one company thing as we live in a world of uncertainty. Definite optimism clashes with the idea of power law returns in this book. Maybe it is illogical to say being a definite optimist is impossible and all we can hope for is to be a semi-definite optimist. Here is where it gets a bit semantic and we drill down into Theil’s point. Indefinite Optimism is akin to planning a party outside and saying im not sure what the weather will be, but I’m confident it will be good. Versus definite optimist saying “I looked at the weather and it’s going to be 75 and sunny tomorrow.” So we need to approach a probabilistic and indefinite world in a definite way, by first anticipating problems, believing they can be solved, and coming up with a systematic way to solve them. The clash with these ideas is the definite optimism of countries like China and Russia which are mischaracterized here. They are employing their own form of definite optimism with 10 year plans and internet firewalls. They are not doing this to actively make their country worse. They believe China will be a super power which is optimistic and through their methods which in the West are viewed negatively are the way to do this. This idea loops back to the earlier idea “Conventions only appear wrong in hindsight question your reality.” This is not a digression into communism as clearly it has never proved to work and is not the optimal form of government given its nonexistent checks and balances nor is this in support of a Chinese system that suppresses the free will of it’s people and is willing to put the country over the lives of millions. The great leap forward famine caused upwards of 50 million deaths and currently millions are more or less enslaved in concentration comps. To Xi and Mao these are negative consequences of their plan which is definitely optimistic, but to the Western eye this is 1984 dystopia at its finest. All this to say, definite optimism comes in many forms and this idea is better expressed through the idea of good explanations knowing problems are inevitable and soluble.

    - **Note:** Original Jackson wrote a ton, past Jackson wrote a lot, hopefully future Jackson is smarter. Definite vs indefinite and optimism vs pessimism forms the matrix of outlooks. The best EV decision is optimism and the way to achieve that is using our agency understanding that the problems will be hard but we are able to solve them and make the world a better place. This is very aligned with good explanations and problems being inevitable and soluble. Definite optimism is probabilistic not deterministic and says that the world can be better in the future and if we take these actions it may be part of that progress.
      This also provides perspective taking of other cultures we see as pessimistic but in fact in their eyes it's optimism for their future. Diversification is for losers.
      Conventions only appear wrong in hindsight question your reality.
- There are two ways to view the world static and dynamic. Either you think we have nothing to create or you bet that we have everything to create in front of us. This is zero sum versus positive sum. Working on hard problems versus being a doomsday believer. There is no guarantee the world will not end, but problems are both inevitable and soluble. Betting on humanity is hard especially in an uncertain future, but it’s the only positive EV bet. Static or fixed worldview relies on extrapolations from the past and assumes we are in a perfect state of knowledge. Static mindsets or worldviews are more common and popular because they’re very simple and don’t require you to envision a very different world than the one we live in today. A dynamic worldview bets on the power of human creation and massive unpredictable change. The world in this view will be drastically different due to the actions of possibly very few people and predicting it is nearly impossible. We cannot predict how each water atom will move but we don’t need to know this to know it will boil.

    - **Note:** Static world view and extrapolation is easy but a dynamic world is more emergent and challenging. We need to remain optimistic pursue better problems and believe in our agency to solve them. This is the only positive mindset ev bet.
      Dynamic world views are hard because they’re tough to believe but change is the nature of the world so we should bet on it position for it and remain optimistic.
      Active optimism highest ev bet vs static mindset. We can’t predict emergence but it is a fact of all systems.
