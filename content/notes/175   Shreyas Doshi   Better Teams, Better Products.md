- Insights from Shreya Stoshy: Three Levels of Product Work and Conflict Origins
  Key takeaways:
  - Conflict between people and teams can arise when they are not aligned on the level at which they are talking.
  - The three levels of product work that can lead to conflict are the execution level, the impact level, and the optics level.
  - Misalignment in communication levels can cause confusion and stress among individuals and teams.
  - Product managers and engineers often focus on the execution level, while executives tend to prioritize the impact level.
  - Leaders of different teams may fixate on different levels, such as optics, impact, or execution, leading to inter-team conflict.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  So the execution level, the impact level and the optics level. Can you expand on these levels and where conflict arises?
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, for sure. So this took me many years, almost two decades of working on product set mainly at high tech companies to really realize. Oftentimes, conflict between people and teams arises mainly because we're not talking at the same level. We might have similar missions and similar goals and OKRs and whatnot, but if we are not aligned on the level at which we are talking, that can lead to a lot of confusion, a lot of stress Among individuals and teams. And so the three levels of product work that I discovered through my observations were the execution level, the impact level and the optics level. Oftentimes, there would be product managers or other folks on my team who would be very nervous before presenting to an executive. Maybe it's a product strategy or something else. And they'd be very nervous. And so I'd have a conversation with them about like, hey, nervousness is normal in these situations, etc. But what's really going on? What is your real concern? And so they'd often point to past examples where they would say, oh, I was talking to the CEO in this last product review and I shared with them exact details of how we can make these goals More ambitious or whatever the case might be. And that just did not land with the executive. And I shared all the details with them, but I felt like they were confused and now they've asked for this other product review. And so now I'm frustrated. And in that example, my observation is that, again, it's the case of people talking and expecting different levels where somebody who's close to the ground, like a product manager Or an engineer, you are fixated at the extent of the product. And I'm not fixated at the execution level, which is, you know, what is it that I can get done in a short amount of time with the resources and constraints I have. Okay, so that's the execution level. But oftentimes in these situations, the executive, the CEO, wants to start at the impact level. They are more concerned about, well, is this product going to resonate? Fine, we'll build the product, but how are we going to sell the product? Have we thought about compelling ways to do that? And how is this going to affect the company's brand? Right, so they want to start with the level of the impact and they want to engage in a dialogue with you of how we can make the best possible impact. But then if you come into this kind of product review as the product manager and you can not drown the group in all sorts of execution level detail, which you think are the right things To share because these are challenges you're facing right now. If you lead with that, you are going to lose the audience. And this is merely just one example of where executives are probably thinking at the impact level, product managers or engineers are thinking at the execution level. And I've also encountered team issues, inter-team issues, famously, that many organizations where two teams can't work together and they complain. And each team complains that we can't work well with this other team. Even in those situations, I've often found that it's actually the leaders of the team that are fixating on different things. Maybe the leader of one team is very optics focused, so they are thinking about what are the optics going to look like if we combine our forces together and work on this initiative, how Can we make sure that my team gets the credit that it deserves for doing this work. And perhaps another team leader is more fixated on the impact level or the execution level. They sweat and they kind of litigate and re-litigate a lot of details without really realizing that, oh, the conflict is present mainly because one is operating at the optics level And the other is operating at the execution or impact level. ([TimeÂ 0:02:09](https://share.snipd.com/snip/22e8acd0-f35c-47ba-83b6-9966b7c22672))
    - **Note:** Levels of products execution optics and impact People struggle when theyâ€™re talking at different levels. Right level of abstraction. Executives think at the impact level while pms think at the product level and they end up talking past each other have having different conversations. Then youâ€™re having 2 conversations you talk past people and it gets worse. You need to explore and cultivate empathy. Measurement vs evaluation just because you canâ€™t quantify how something is going doesnâ€™t mean youâ€™re not improving donâ€™t get lost in the dogma of measurement only. Good founders like Patrick and John had strong customer feedback loops as they scaled They didnâ€™t just talk to ceos but low level people using the product every day which helped the company soul when the founders live its values. Benefits of a writing culture is it allows more contemplation and less ego factors and off the cuff. Writing culture leads to more codification less info loss.
- The Role of Judgment in Team Success
  Key takeaways:
  - Failure often occurs when decision-making becomes judgment-based and lacks solid rationale, numbers, or authority.
  - The judgment of the leader plays a crucial role in differentiating between a good team and a great team.
  - The clarity and philosophy behind how a team makes decisions are important factors for success.
  - Willingness to bend rules, within ethical boundaries, can indicate a team's ability to think critically and adapt.
  - High agency among individual contributors is vital for teams to creatively execute and influence outcomes.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  I think one of the reasons that it fails is because it becomes judgment-based. And as much as people like to say that they make judgment decisions, they don't actually like to make judgment decisions because they like to have a lot of rationale behind or numbers Behind or authority behind why they make a decision. And when the judgment is subjective, in this case, you have a tiebreaker, somebody has to be an arbitrator of that, whether it's the founder or somebody up the line. But what they're really doing is they're exercising judgment. And that's where you get a lot of leverage from. When that judgment's correct, it's really powerful and when it's not correct, it can destroy a company. Absolutely.
  Speaker 1
  I like to observe that, you know, there's a difference between very good teams that operate quite well and really great teams. The teams that are not only able to operate quite well on one project, but on multiple projects and are able to cross-pollinate their goodness to other teams that they work with. One of my observations about the core difference between a good team and a great team is the judgment of the leader of that team.
  Speaker 2
  What other observations do you have about the difference between a good and a great team?
  Speaker 1
  The first one is really the best way to describe it is what is their clarity on how this team makes decisions. And I mean it certainly from a tactical kind of process perspective, but I mean it more from a almost a philosophical perspective, right, which is that. You know, what are we optimizing for? And if you look at all those sort of like, you know, the great companies out there, right, like they have some way of deciding what makes sense, what product to build and how to build the Product, how much attention to detail to give certain things and how much to build fast, right. And hopefully some of those are codified in the operating values or the operating principles of the company. But does this team have clarity on that kind of philosophy for how they're making decisions? Is I think a really important factor? And then are they actually following through on it in their day to day? So that is one thing I like to call out. Second thing I like to call out is to what degree is the team willing to bend rules, right. I'm not talking about like breaking laws because you shouldn't do that, but to what degree are you willing to bend rules? And there are teams that like want to do the right thing that will follow all the rules, right. And they do it for two reasons. One is there is usually kind of, you know, a little bit, perhaps some insecurity, perhaps a lack of adequate courage on the part of the leaders of the team. But the other is being able to defend when things go wrong, right. So, you know, following rules is very comfortable because if we follow all the rules and it doesn't work out, we can just point at the rules and say, look, we followed all the rules, we Followed the process, we came to all the product reviews, we showed you all the mockups and all the intermediate artifacts as the rules said, right. And so therefore now if this product failed in the market or failed to win, don't blame me, right. Like I followed the rules, right. And this is how a lot of operators operate in organizations.
  Speaker 2
  I call that the McDonald's problem because, you know, I used to work in tech as well and people would do this all the time where it's like, I followed all the rules, I got the wrong outcome. And I would say, well, if all you do is follow the rules, you should be getting minimum wage because what we're paying you for is judgment. You need to know when to opt out when that doesn't make sense or where it's leading down the wrong path and that drove people crazy.
  Speaker 1
  Yep, yep, yep, it's so interesting that people don't see that the reason they're getting paid the big bucks is, and the way they'll create alpha for their team or for their company is Through that judgment, right. Because if everybody could just follow playbooks, then, you know, and they might be wonderful playbooks, but over time even wonderful playbooks become the industry standard. So now if you want to outperform, you need something else and that something else is always judgment. And so, yeah, absolutely, you know, that kind of like willingness to bend rules. And now the question is kind of, well, how do I know which rules to bend, right. That's the next question I get. When I write about these things, it's like, again, it goes back to judgment. One, you know, I have quite a few on the list of like the attributes of, you know, good to great teams, but another one I'll share that is often not discussed is just, you know, high agency Among the individual contributors of the team. Because I think like at some point, you know, a team, say it's like 10, 20, 30, 40 people, 50 people more, it becomes really important, not just for the leaders to be ambitious and have Good judgment and so on, but for the individual contributors to be very high agency people, where they feel that they have the ability to end the sort of desire to influence outcomes, Right. And they are going to execute creatively to do that. And in some cases, they are going to bend rules. And in many cases, you know, most teams have constraints, right, whether they're staffing constraints or funding constraints or whatever else. And it's this ability of at least a few individuals on the team. You don't need the entire team to be extremely high agency, but the ability of at least a few individuals on the team to have an embody this high agency approach such that, oh, actually, Yes, we do have this obstacle, but here's how we're going to creatively execute around that obstacle in order to make impact. So those would be a few, you know, items I would share in terms of kind of that difference between, you know, good and great teams. ([TimeÂ 0:31:28](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e6c413fc-1a15-410d-afea-eb9f83b4d790))
    - **Note:** Alpha in management comes from judgements. Because theyâ€™re so subjective and great teams are able to have a great clarity of decision from a tactical but also philosophical allignment how well are the goals and day to day in the soul of the company. Also how high agency are the employees and how willing are they to bend rules. If you bend the rules and fail your ass is covered. You need to know when to opt out. Rules exist to be broken and if youâ€™re just following the book youâ€™re a robot you get paid for transcend the paradigms and creating agency in your role. Hiding behind the rules is deep failure you need to be high agency and work within the framework but also say this is dumb how can I transcend these I need to break these for a better outcome. You need to have team members with high agency and the desire and ability to influence outcomes creatively. Companies have constraints and you need people who see obstacles and think how can I get around or through this.
- Exploring the Agency Talent Matrix and its Connection to High Agency and Talent
  Key takeaways:
  - The agency talent matrix is a combination of high agency and talent.
  - Low talent and low agency individuals perform undifferentiated work.
  - High talent but low agency individuals often complain about their circumstances.
  - High agency but low talent individuals are ambitious but lack competence.
  - High agency and high talent individuals are game changers.
  - Go getters can become game changers with enough experience.
  - Experience factors can be rapidly made up for.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  We're going to go back to writing in a second, but we just hit on the agency. So I want to go down to rabbit hole here, which is you came up with the agency talent matrix. I'm wondering if you can explain what that is and how you use it. Yeah.
  Speaker 1
  And so, you know, as I was thinking back a few years ago about like the people I've seen that have outsized outcomes consistently, both for themselves and for the teams and the companies They're part of. I realized that there were some patterns between those individuals. That's when I came across this term, high agency, which I believe Eric Weinstein coined the term. And, you know, essentially it's a high agency is about. It's basically about, you know, doing certain things, doing taking on hard things without waiting for condition to be conditions to be perfect or otherwise blaming your circumstances. I wanted to kind of marry this idea of high agency that I came across with the idea of your talent, right, the degree of talent you have. Or the degree of competence, whatever kind of term we use there. And so then you can kind of start to imagine this, you know, two by two matrix of like, you know, low agency, high agency on one axis along one axis and then low talent and high talent along The other axis. And so you get this kind of, you know, these kind of four quadrants, if you will, where if you have low talent and low agency, right, then you are going to be a cog in the wheel. You're going to perform some undifferentiated work. And maybe that's essential work, but whatever work you do is not really going to substantially change or improve the trajectory of the organization. Or even if your own outcomes, right. So that's kind of the low talent, low agency quadrant. Then you have the high talent, but low agency person. Okay, so like these might be, you know, really brilliant people. Maybe they went to, you know, really amazing schools. They have great pedigree, etc, etc. But, and we've all worked with such folks over time where, you know, they have tremendous potential, but somehow there is probably, you know, something that's kind of stopping them And they're often kind of looking around them and complaining about, well, but this is not right. And, but like we don't have clarity on the cross or goals and we don't have, you know, we don't have the resources we need. And we don't have the cross or support we need and the cross function support, etc, etc. And look like pointing these things out by them by itself. I don't think is a bad thing, right? Like you would need to confront the reality of your situation. But what happens to kind of when you have low agency, but high talent is you have the ability to point these things out, but you don't quite demonstrate the drive and the resilience, the Confidence and sort of the creative execution to do something about it. Right? You're waiting for conditions to be perfect. And you have this fantasy in your head that when conditions are perfect, I will be able to achieve the potential of myself or my goal of my team. So that quadrant, I call the frustrated geniuses. There is no situation that is ever going to be up to the standards of perfection that they're hoping for. Then you also have the high agency, but perhaps low talent group. And that group I call go getters, right? So these are folks that are just like they're very ambitious. They want to get things done. They are often very creative. They're very excited. They want to take on new projects. They have a high degree of optimism. But perhaps they're early in their career, right? And so they don't yet have the talent and the full competence, right? So go getters is an interesting group. And like one other observation that I made over the years is that, you know, given generally this is more a guiding group. Even if you were bringing in your new adult life, you would have something of its accountability too. It's a more exciting degree to create with your degree for your best and my highly low health habits, like give problems and meaningful opportunities to empower either good level or Better, like anybody on thealiyle that is compete only doing the same level. Product management, the role I have done for many, many years, is a role whose primary responsibility is to resolve ambiguities and act in the presence of ambiguities. So for PMs, it becomes really important to kind of have this high agency. And then lastly, the last quadrant in this matrix is the high agency and high talent quadrant. And these folks, I just call them game changers. Like they change the game for the company, for the team, for themselves. But the reality is that there are very few of them. So if you come across a game changer early in their career, you better hold on to them, right? And you better provide them with the opportunities and the support that is necessary for them to achieve their potential. And last thing I'll say on this topic is sometimes go getters over time become game changers, because with enough experience, now you can increase your competence. So you can go from the low, perhaps on the low talent side to the high talent side, just by virtue of having that much more experience. And so again, in many cases, for certain roles, I would rather prefer a go getter who's perhaps a little bit lacking on certain experience factors, because I've found that those experience Factors can be rapidly made up for. ([TimeÂ 0:38:04](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b0c9ea0a-21cb-42c4-84de-a87cb2b0e3db))
    - **Note:** Agency talent matrix. High agency is doing hard things without asking permission or waiting for circumstances to be perfect. Going through uncertainty bravely and not being a victim but taking extreme ownership. high agency low talent go getter high agency high talent game changer. High talent low agency frustrated genius. Go getters can grow into game changers agency above all.
- The Benefits of a Writing Culture in Decision-Making and Proposal Sharing
  Key takeaways:
  - Having a writing culture creates a permissionless environment for sharing ideas and proposals.
  - In non-writing cultures, big decisions are usually made in meetings which require permission to join and present.
  - A writing culture removes constraints and allows for improvements to be shared through writing and feedback.
  - Stripe is an example of a company with a writing culture.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, I think one of the areas where it's extremely helpful is when you have a writing culture, it becomes more of a permissionless environment. You know, you know, you know, say non-writing culture, where perhaps the way big decisions are made or proposals are shared, it's usually in some meeting where perhaps, you know, we Have a discussion or I walk you through a slide deck. Well, the observation is that all of a sudden, if that's the way that big proposals need to be made or even small proposals need to be made, now you need permission, right? You need permission to join the meeting. You need permission to present at the meeting. You need permission. You need to ask for permission to take a synchronous, meaningful slot of everybody's time to be able to share what you want to share. And a true writing culture kind of removes a lot of those constraints, right? So if you spot something that you think needs to be improved in a writing culture, in a true writing culture, you can write about it and share the document and see what people have to say, See if it resonates. And certainly, you know, at Stripe as a writing culture, I saw it often where there were people, you know, regardless of ([TimeÂ 0:45:47](https://share.snipd.com/snip/13a5964b-e05c-4167-9eb2-ebbf84634791))
    - **Note:** In a writing culture it creates a permissionless enviornment for sharing ideas and innovations. In a writing culture it becomes very important to have good communication abilities and writing abilities. You can have 5 great ideas buried in 10 pages and your point isnâ€™t clear. Too much confusion and they want to communicate everything they know on a topic to build a bulletproof case but structurally itâ€™s broken. The problem is writing with empathy for the reader means creating better structure and clarity. Start with what message youâ€™re trying to share and your strongest points you have 8 seconds to grab peoples attention then you can use the appendix to express additional support or later in the piece. Itâ€™s important to work backwards from the goal to the appropriate structure. The narratives in a blog post book and movie are all different you need to shape the structure and narrative for the medium.
- The Dangers of Chasing Quick Wins in Product Development
  Key takeaways:
  - One needs to be able to operate regardless of the circumstance
  - The antithesis principle requires embracing inconsistency
  - Opportunity costs should be considered in decision making
  - Teams often prioritize work with a small denominator in ROI calculations
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  I think that's a powerful encapsulation of an idea which boils down to you need to be able to operate regardless of the circumstance that you find yourself in. If you can only operate in ideal circumstances, you're only gonna be average because circumstances are never gonna be ideal and you need to find a way to operate no matter what the circumstances Are.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, and I think the challenge for many people is that the reason the antithesis principle is not extremely intuitive and certainly it wasn't for me early on in my life is because it Requires us to embrace inconsistency. Like we just like habitually look for consistency. So the thing we observe in the world, we want ourselves to act consistently with the thing we observe in the world. But the antithesis principle says that the very fact that you made an observation about this thing in the world, the way the world works. And in all of its imperfect ways, it indicates that yeah, sure by all means to have an impact and to be effective, you need to recognize the way the world works. But that doesn't automatically mean that you also embody that in yourself. And perhaps just to drive the example home, the first time I really realized this is when, I was just kinda reading, we've all heard this anecdote and I don't know if it's true, but it's The, what is that, the idea that people form a strong impression of you within seven seconds of meeting you. Right? And so what that suggests is that like, if you want to be influential, if you want to make an impact, you should work towards creating a strong positive impression, right, in the first Few moments of any interaction. And I think many people do that, right? But when I started thinking about it for myself, I realized that, but wait, if I fall prey to that same bias, right, I am going to unfairly judge other people who are otherwise great perhaps, But perhaps they did not make a strong great impression in the first seven seconds. So I need to actually follow for myself, I need to follow the antithesis of that when I am meeting somebody new, right? And again, that kinda inconsistency is not natural to us as humans. And so it kinda like, we really need to be intentional about developing it.
  Speaker 2
  I wanna ask you about how you think about opportunity costs as they relate to decision making. Yeah, most of us and most teams certainly are ROI machines.
  Speaker 1
  They are return on investment machines. And the way we evaluate things is evaluate work, whether to do a certain work or not, is this going to provide us with a positive ROI, right? And again, during my own career as a person who kind of was responsible for deciding what should we build, when should we build it, what should we build first? For a long time I used ROI as a core way of thinking about the work we do. So it sounds good, but the challenges, like the formula for ROI is like, the value you got minus the effort or the time or expense you put in to get the value divided by the effort time expense, Right? Whatever the case might be. So it's a ratio, right? Now whenever you have a ratio and you want to increase that ratio, so in this case ROI, you can increase the numerator or you can play a trick and decrease the denominator, right? So you can keep the numerator constant, but if you just decrease the denominator, you can increase the ratio. And so I saw that tendency play out very often in making decisions about what to work on next, what to prioritize, how to think about our priorities, is oftentimes, you know, teams will Gravitate towards things where the denominator is small, right? So practically what that meant is, this is low hanging fruit. This is a quick win, right? Oh, it will only take one day to do it, right? Like, and then I'd ask like, what's the impact of it? Well, it doesn't have a very high impact, but again, because it's quick, let's do it, right? And so we get kind of really seduced by this kind of, you know, tendency to want to reduce the denominator. And what does that do, what that leads to is a lot of me to products. It leads to us kind of just meeting table stakes. It leads to kind of picking the safe things because the safe things are, you know, easy to quantify and they're safe because they're easy to quantify. ([TimeÂ 0:59:54](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9d13a10c-0862-4405-ba64-43a214903fdb))
    - **Note:** The power of using inversion in your life when the world sees things one way how can you benefit from that. If the world learns better from engaging content or rushes ri conclusions about people or wants to work for great people how can you succeed by learning from boring things or working with ok people and succeeding or getting to know people better than unlocks alpha. We look at ROI but doing something easy has a high ROI because small return but really small investment how do we go after bhags maybe a lower local ROI but higher global ROI. Instead look at opportunity cost of missing the optimal option. In high leverage role increase ROI and lower opportunity cost.
- The Three Components of Product Sense
  Key takeaways:
  - Product sense is the ability to make correct product decisions.
  - Companies that consistently build successful products embody product sense.
  - Product sense is comprised of three components: cognitive empathy, domain knowledge, and creativity.
  - Cognitive empathy involves understanding how users and customers think and approach situations.
  - Domain knowledge includes understanding the technology, market, competition, and regulations.
  - Creativity involves using cognitive empathy and domain knowledge to propose concrete ideas for product development.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  All right. And so let's take, in this case, again, let's take product sense. Well, product sense, which is, again, the ability to make the correct product decision. This is by the way, by the way, like, some people are really great at consistently building very good products. This is why some companies are very good at building products that resonate with their users, is because they really embody that product sense in the work they do. So well, it turns out, product sense has three components. The first is cognitive empathy, which is, do I understand how you think as a user, how customers think, how they approach situations, what will resonate for them or not? That is cognitive empathy. Second is domain knowledge. Do I understand enough about this domain, about the technology, about the market, about the competition, et cetera, et cetera, such that I can make a decision that will differentiate Us, such that I do understand regulation and the limitations of what we can get done, et cetera. So that's kind of domain knowledge. And then the third piece is creativity. And creativity is about taking these two inputs, which is cognitive empathy and domain knowledge, and turning it into a concrete proposal for what we are going to build. ([TimeÂ 1:10:13](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2e4fe332-c2c1-4c9c-922a-76818f7077c0))
    - **Note:** How can we systematically grow our knowledge we need to break it down to component parts from a product sense how much cognitive empathy do we have how much domain knowledge and creativity ties this together. You can have the first 2 but if you canâ€™t tie together it wonâ€™t work. Always make sure youâ€™re learning outside of work and taking 2-3 hours a week to learn outside of your job. You need to take control of your knowledge and future you cannot rely on the organization and your day to day to do that. Success is spending the most time at the things that are most important. If youâ€™re spending more time on work than with friends your priorities and stack rank are off. Understand your priorities and allocate your time accordingly is success.
