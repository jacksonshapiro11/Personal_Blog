  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So now he tells us a little about school and im going to tild this together, whot with an idea that i learned from david olgravy. So he says, i might have been innurd, but on the whole, school was good.
  Speaker 2
  I got good grades without having to work at it. Never truly great grades because i didn't work at it. And an accepted place, and i had an accepted place in the social order. Nobody else really seemed to care too much about my nose.
  Speaker 1
  He talks about, i his big nose over in oregon.
  Speaker 2
  This was, almost certainly, in retrospect, because they cared because they cared about their own problems a whole lot more.
  Speaker 1
  So how does this tie it to david ogrevy? So david ogrevi has this idea that when when he would go try to pitch somebody o to use the services as company, he'd start out with all the things they're bat at.
  Speaker 2
  And he got the idea from antique dealers wh who would point out the flaws in whathey're tying to sell you first. And telling somebody the flaws up for up front causes them to trust you.
  Speaker 1
  And the more they trust you, the more likely they are to purchase what you're selling, right?
  Speaker 2
  And so in this case, the entire first chapter is, i'm ugly, i'm lazy, i'm selfish, i have no social skills, whatever.
  Speaker 1
  And in this works because it makes the book more refreshing. Over and over again, he talks about the image that he has in the media versus how he actually is. And he always picks the least flattering story. ([Time 0:06:04](https://share.snipd.com/snip/68e4329a-1b6e-407d-92b6-1094d15c21e6))
    - **Note:** The meaning of life to him and the three things that motivate people to do things his first survival then a social order you exist in then having fun. He grows up a self called nerd and at the beginning talks about all the negatives of himself to lower his initial status and be upfront before proceeding with the book. Didn’t control humans and didn’t have social interaction but loved playing with computers he spent much of his waking hours with computers. The toy of today is the industry of tomorrow. He did not have a massive ego relative to other tech founders and was very introverted with a deep knowledge of business history.

  - Few people actually live their lives the way he suggests
  - His operating system is based on simplicity and clean design
  - He compares his approach to language with the English and Chinese languages

  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And this is the most important part. And really, i think again, think about his entire, you can summarite the title of the book, is his entire philosophy on life, on work and everything else, just for fun ver.
  Speaker 2
  And the reason i find this book so appealing, and i'm glad it was recommended to me, is because very few people actually live their lives that way. It's extremely, extremely hard to do so. But it's a really fairly simple operating system.
  Speaker 1
  And he talks about his love of simplicity, which i'm goingto share some more quotes on in a minute.
  Speaker 2
  But he says, this is, i really like the sentence. I hope you can say the same about something.
  Speaker 1
  So he sang, hey, as a young kid, maybe 19, 20 years old, whetever he is at this time, i got a big enthusiastic jolt. Frankly, it never subsided. So more than a decade later, he's still working on it to this day.
  Speaker 2
  So multiple decades later, i hope you can say the same about something.
  Speaker 1
  So he starts reading the book, he becomes completely obsessed. And we're goin to see, he just starts, he's going to focus, hes going to sleep and he's going to write. He whas not, i guess id need to back up and tell you, he not plan on writing his own operating system. It just happened that way.
  Speaker 2
  So says, there were, there were two things i did that summer, nothing and read the 700 ad, 19 pages of operating systems designed in mitation.
  Speaker 1
  So now he talks about his philosophy about ugly systems and simplicityand and everything that goes into how he approaches his work in the product he built. Right?
  Speaker 2
  An ugly system is one in which there are special interfaces for everything you want to do. Eunuc is the opposite. It gives you the building blocks that are sufficient for doing everything that. That's what having a clean design is all about.
  Speaker 1
  This is a really fascinating metaphor he uses here, check to sall. And this is where i'e really sunk in my mind. Euse.
  Speaker 2
  'm not a programmer, ah, and the way he describes it's, even though i'm not a programmer, hearing somebody speak about something they're passionat about, it's just, it's infectious. It's very attractive, right? So he says, it's the same with languages. The english language has 26 letters, and you can build up everything from those letters.
  Speaker 1
  And you can compare languages, the differnce between the the english language and the chinese language with complicated operating systems and the ones that he wanted to build right?
  Speaker 2
  Or you have the chinese language, in which you have one letter for every single thing you can think of. In chinese, you start off with complexity, and you can combine complexity in limited ways.
  Speaker 1
  He says, this is the approach of windows. So remember, this is written at the 99, two thousand maybe two thousand one. So i've, i've covered a bunch of books from this erro, including the one just did o a few weeks ago, the bill gates one. And jus, everybody's possessor make herself at this point in history.
  Speaker 2
  So says, eunuxh, on the other hand, comes with a small, is beautiful philosophy. It has a small set of simple, basic building blocks that can be combined into something that allows for infiniteo complexity of expression.
  Speaker 1
  Then he gives us the history of where eunuchs comes from. A came out of 18 tol bill labs. Ah. But really this is the punch line. And ive really appreciated what he said here. You should absolutely not dismiss simplicity for something easy. It takes design and good taste to be simple. So it's funny that he says that case, that sounds like something exactly i've heard steve jobb say things like that. ([Time 0:14:51](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3fbc2ad6-fd64-4c2a-b888-4b22c63d9851))
    - **Note:** A book changes his life on operating systems and spurns him to go make his own. He writes code and sleeps this summer and is just doing this all for fun. He found simplicity and beauty in this and just did it because he was having fun. Follow your thick desires. An ugly system is fragmented while a good clean system gives you the building blocks and allows you to grow from there. Small set of building blocks that creates infinite expression. Universal system like English alphabet not Chinese which is a complex alphabet with a lot of rigidity. Simplicity isn’t something easy but is usually very hard to cultivate deep simplicity. There’s multiple ways to solve the same problem he builds a successful computer product trying to just make something open source. He got the design influence from bell labs who had created Unix but saw no commercial selling point for it so just open sourced it.

  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  It was march, maybe april. I was spending most of my time in a bathrobe, huddled over my unattractive new computer, with thick black window shades shielding me from the sunlightn to mention the outside world. I was eking out the monthly payments for my pc, which was scheduled to be paid off in three years. What i didn't know then was that i would only be sending in payments for another year. By then, i would have written lennox, which would, which would be seen by many more people than just sarah, that's a sister, and laura at's is friend a.
  Speaker 1
  By that time, another personality was interested in lennox.
  Speaker 2
  Would have started a collection on the inner net tget my computer paid off.
  Speaker 1
  Everybody knew i wasn't making any money on lennox.
  Speaker 2
  People just started saying, let's start a collection to pay off linus computer.
  Speaker 1
  It was wonderful.
  Speaker 2
  I had absolutely no money. I always felt it was important not to have asked for money or begged for money. But the fact is it was simply given to me.
  Speaker 1
  I'm getting choked up talking ab getting choked up thinking about al these people volunteering to pay offhis computer ecause they what he made so much. That's how lennox got started. And this is also talk about later in the book, about he started geting a lot of media attention. And the they compare in contrast, the media automatic that compares in contrast a lines with bill gates. Bill gates is living in this, you knowa zanado, or whatever he calls his, his 50 thousand square foot house. ([Time 0:19:24](https://share.snipd.com/snip/07af66cf-d9b3-4472-8dd7-defe506fc4b7))
    - **Note:** Linus builds Linux in one year and gives it away he’s just writing his code in his apartment and the community is so thankful they start sending him money to payoff his stuff like his computer. He the whole time is lazy but just does this because he loves it. He ends up getting free stock options from companies that go public using Linux and becomes well off. He would’ve hated running a company so he just put his work into the world through Linux and the world rewarded him. He would get fixated on a problem and go into his own world to try to solve it. He never did anything he didn’t think was fun. He just did what he loved so it was easy for him and he never gave up. He thinking’s programming is the most interesting thing in the world that allows you to create anything you want. He loves programming. The problem gets solved by thinking about it. He also needed and loved control. He does it not to be a leader he was an adopted unwilling leader in this movement. Talks a lot about problem solving and how stepping back and reframing the question is vital.
- He almost gives up in every key story there is a fork in the road where quitting is the only option and these people just say no and keep going. Linus didn’t know how to do anything but program so when he hit a snag he just had to keep going. He basically sits in his apartment all day writing code and then decides to release it to a few people when he had a working prototype. Big things start small and you need to let it grow and cultivate. Start small and scale. Linux slowly diffused into the community and instead of asking for cash he asked for postcards to understand his spread out it had gotten. He just wants to spread his product at the base level then sell valued added services on top but he really gets thought of as this technological monk who didn’t need money.

    - **Note:** Before big breakthroughs people come close to giving up its darkest before the dawn keep pushing. He wanted to spread the community and grow the product. Start small and scale.
      Deep focus he writes code all day.

    - **Note:** Good leadership is empowering others to create and checking your ego at the door to admit you’re wrong. Let others do what they want not what you want admit when you’re wrong and evolve. Allows others to build things for him. Open source code was a great way to get your work out there and also get status in the eyes of your peers. Just because he wasn’t charging didn’t mean money didn’t motivate him it was just a slightly different motivation. He likes the American system of power law returns to the best workers not slight variations in salary. In one month really or week/ day he leaves his job at the university of Helsinki turns in his thesis has a kid and moves to America to work a commercial job. People give him pushback for selling out to the man but he has an inner scorecard and doesn’t care still works on Linux in his new job. He believes deeply in sleep never overworks always gets his rest.
- He was a benevolent dictator of Linux small companies were disorganized but somehow this decentralized mass of people could build an entire operating system. Linus controlled the kernal as the benevolent dictator because no one else really had the chops or claim to do so other than him. He doesn’t proactively delegate but let’s people run with subsystem development when they raise their hands. Doesn’t make decisions let’s things happen naturally. Always optimizing for fun and enjoys his life. He realizes he’s an asshole due to his lack of social skills but the benefit of open source is that it doesn’t matter in a decentralized system. The great thing about open source is the leader can be an asshole and can be subverted. Human creativity is rare and has a massive price tag if yiu can’t make a good product and instead try to control people you’ll eventually go out of business. Don’t control the resource make a better product. Create a product that competes on its merits not just has vendor lock in. Delight customers. People want solutions they want a hole not a drill. Only thing in life that is constant is change. New issues comes up and the world evolves. That what he sees as fun. Love life for your own entertainment.

    - **Note:** Decentralized systems are good because they require no leadership and the defecto leader can be an ass and it doesn’t matter.
      Delight customers if you’re not making someone’s life better you’re going to be disintermediated in the long run. If you don’t you go out of business.
      Life is about having fun and being entertained enjoyment is the highest form of meaning.
      Human creativity is rare and expensive
      Management style let’s people take on tasks doesnt assign but allows high agency people to reach out
      People want solutions.
