### Highlights

- Becoming Indistractible: Overcoming Feelings that Hinder Our Goals
  Key takeaways:
  - The reason for not following through with goals is often a feeling of not wanting to do it.
  - Tasks that are difficult or not enjoyable require different tactics to accomplish.
  - Start with personal values when making a time box calendar.
  - Attributes of the person you want to become define personal values.

  Exactly. And so that's where becoming indestructible comes into play. You don't need to be indestructible for something you love doing anyway. Right. There's no problem with that. Follow through is easy. It's how do I do this stuff? I know I need to do, but I really don't feel like doing it. If you ask, you know, we talked about earlier, the only reason businesses fail is because they run out of cash. The only reason we fail out our goals is only one. The only reason we fail out our goals because we don't feel like it. I don't feel like I don't feel like going to the gym right now. I don't feel like working on that book. I don't feel like whatever it is. It's a feeling, fundamentally, it's a feeling. Of course, there's outside factors, of course. But in terms of the number one reason we don't pursue our goal is we quit. Right. That's the most prominent reason we don't follow through. And that tends to be because of a feeling. So when there are these tasks that suddenly get hard, right, or suddenly difficult, that's when we need different tactics. It's easy to do the stuff we enjoy. It's hard to do the stuff that we don't enjoy.

  So what would you advise me to do then? In the case of DJing, I've got, you know, potentially two shows this summer in Europe.
  Speaker 1
  So I would start with your values. And that's part of step two of making time for traction. When people ask, you know, how do I make a time box calendar? Where do you start? You start with your values. So what are values, the definition of values in my book, is attributes of the person you want to become attributes of the person you want to become. So then what you do is you put your your values in terms of these three life domains. I look at them as concentric circles. At the center of these three life domains is you. If you can't take care of yourself, can't take care of others, you can't make the world a better place. So in that, when it comes to that life domain, you look at the things that you want to do for yourself, the time you want to spend to become the person you want to become.

    - **Note:** The only thing that prevents us from our goals is applying ourselves to the tasks. Businesses die because they run out of money and people fail because they quit. Being able to embrace the suck and do what you hate is key to success.
