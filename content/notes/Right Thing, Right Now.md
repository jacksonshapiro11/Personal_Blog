### Highlights

- We have a universal oneness we are all connected. We must expand our circle of kindness not to just who we love but animals even ants and grass because we’re one universal world. Examine thoughtless cruelty in our own way of living to people or animals and work to resolve them. If you don’t care about ants it’s a small step to not caring and subjugating other people care for all life. Find the good in everyone no matter how hard. We must see the positive in all. Never relinquish your deep devotion to the cause a revolutionary war general blew up his house because it was Brittish occupied and a Roman went back as a prisoner to his death because his devotion to his cause and word didn’t let him cower from certain death. Love always wins you cannot let your heart become hardened by the past you must allow love in and embrace it. Easy to read and see the injustice from the past and hate the world but you must fight with love it is the only way of progress. We benefit from the grace and hard work of others in the past and owe it to them to pay it forward always pay the past forward. Forgiveness is a gift you give yourself.
- Be an angel strive to treat others as you wish they’d treat you. As Oscar Wilde was put in prison for being gay among the boos one of his writers friends stood in the mob with a smile and support he then bought all of Wildes works manaaged his estate and provided for his kids be an angel to others. You can be an angel. Do something for others who everyone has refused to help. Don’t leave people to die. You must forgive people you must forgive. There is no greater achievement than forgiving someone when it’s hard and you don’t have to. Forgiveness was preached by Jesus and ghandi and mlk they forgave terrible people because of their values and you must do the same. Forgiveness is a gift we give to ourselves ultimately it’s the only way to transcend your opponent and rise in the situation. Nothing befuddles evil quite like forgiveness. Make amends and tone for sins when you make errors. We’re not perfect. We must address admit our mistakes. Attone for your sins. No justice without ability to a knowledge our mistakes. Have the courage to grapple with the past we can’t undo error but we can admit it. Grow and become a better person through ownership of the past.

    - **Note:** Be an angel to others do the right thing pay it forward and good things come back. Be a good person and friend and sacrifice yourself. Don’t leave people to die. You must forgive. Hate kills you not others. Forgiveness is a gift you give yourself it transcends and confuses evil. Apologize for your mistakes grow and learn. Be courageous admit your mistakes. Attone to our mistakes. Courage to apologize and forgive. Do the hard thing not the easy thing when it’s right.
- Have a next act climb a second mountain don’t just rest on your laurels of success. Sammi Davis Junior became a political activist Lou Gehrig after being diagnosed with ALS became a civil servant in New York when he could barely stand or talk. Can’t just be another vc exit or winning season you need to strive for more a higher calling. Follow your North Star to your next peak which is more spiritual than material that makes you better for taking it on. Not another challange something less about you and material stuff more about helping the world. Don’t do the third thing once you do something good don’t look for recognition just be happy for the thing end of itself. Once you start to look for recognition, you start to destroy the value of the deed. Be thankless and selfless but don’t ask for a reward the doing is the reward. We want people to tell us they love us but we should focus on the deed not the outcome. Do good without expecting credit. You can never lose hope you must maintain it no matter how bleak. Give people hope. To not let them break you is the victory. Things will always get better we can’t give into dispair. You can never give up. You can’t live on hope alone but you can’t live without hope. You gotta give people hope.

    - **Note:** Always pursue your next act transcend yourself. When you accomplish success you need to find a higher calling and transition your life. Find a new peak and north start that is closer to a global optimum. Less material better for the world. Find happiness in itself. Internal locus of control when you need recognition and rewards the deed becomes useless. Process over outcome. Do the right thing don't expect praise. Always keep hope and never break. Dispair and uncle iroh in our darkest times hope is something we give ourselves.
- Ghandi 7 blunders. In human society, all violence can be traced back to these seven recurrent blunders: wealth without work, pleasure without conscience, knowledge without character, commerce without morality, science without humanity, worship without sacrifice, and politics without principles.
    - **Tags:** #long/short-term-incentive-misalignment, #ghandis-7-blunders, #favorite, #ghandi, #sacrifice
    - **Note:** All good ends require a sacrifice you must earn what you get you will be disillusioned if given it
- True pacifism is pushing back on hate with love not just accepting hate and not fighting back. Ghandi went to England to learn how to become a lawyer and read both eastern and western religion and use the western ideas. Mix with the eastern in his unique nonviolence to win over hearts and minds. He also fought for the untouchables and created an idea of worldwide humanity. It wasn’t just about fighting for Indians, but helping all the oppressed people. Gandhi pushed for the Indians to stop using British infrastructure and boycott the system and overtime. They would break free the British used violence. We knew he couldn’t escalate and always remain nonviolent. He knew he would win in the end power of the machine gun is useless because he doesn’t fear death. He used non-violence to win the court of public opinion and take the moral high ground, and eventually everyone rallied around him and won. He discarded want and desire and conquered his fear of death, and this pushed him to success. He listened to the British his enemy trying to understand and work with them for a solution. Never gave up on believing in his opponent.
- Don’t abuse power to exploit the weak. Denial of human rights anywhere is threat to human rights everywhere. Fight for the vulnerable. Make good trouble you don’t need to fight for everything, but you do need to step up to the causes that matter Arthur Ash was very quiet on most issues, but was willing to get arrested to fight against apartheid. Sometimes you need to be aggressive when it matters. Good trouble not just trouble is important. Ask good questions. Seek good trouble. You gotta keep going and stay persistent. You can’t just give up at the first sign of resistance. It could take years or decades to get something done and you must persevere. We must start small and fight the battles that are hard to fight because in that we’re fighting me important ones not just the easy ones we could win. We’re born caring about ourselves and overtime. Start to care about people close to us and then eventually the world just growing those concentric circles of caring out. Love your enemies care for others who don’t care for us even when it’s hard.
- Be pragmatic Harvey milk cut his hair and stopped smoking weed when he ran for office the 2nd time. He needed to be pragmatic and look more electable. You need to be pragmatic not too pure you need to be an idealist and realist and take the world as it is. Strike the golden mean. Know your North Star and follow that direction even if you’re not doing the right thing in the moment it can serve a greater end that is more right. You need to understand and become competent in things in order to change them. You need to be savvy enough to communicate things. You can just know what to say you need to know how to say it. You need to be competent to execute things. Give to others be generous. Giving is vital. Build a coaching tree you should help people progress. Like Gregg popovic he gave people of all different backgrounds a chance and they would leave and compete with him. Giving these people a shot instead of looking out for yourself is vital. Being a teacher and passing down teaching is vital. Be the candle that lights another.
- Become powerful. Nothing gets done without flexing your power. While you can appeal to interests power brokers change the world you need to be one of them or leverage them. When the status quo is unjust people in charge resist change and everything is determined by the balance of powers in the world. Justice isn’t guaranteed to prevail and it won’t prevail without power. To do anything you must understand power. It’s how things get done whether you like it or not power runs the world leverage it for yourself know how it works or you’re fucked.

    - **Note:** Power is how things get done in the real world and ignoring that is death. Understanding power dynamics is important and leveraging them is vital. Understand the game you are playing
- Be kind to others even when you don’t have to kindness deep and true kindness always ages well. Respond with kindness even when people are not kind to you respond with kindness always it’s the right thing. Injustice is everywhere and we must see the truth for ourselves. We must see from the front see how the other half lives walk a mile in their shoes before making up our mind on how we should feel and act towards them. We must see how other people live. You have to help others and make a positive difference you cannot be neutral in a world where evil exists this makes you complicit. Not speaking out against evil means you support it. First they come for others but eventually it becomes due defending the rights of others is defending your future rights. Silence in the faith of evil is evil. Start small he who saves a person saves the world. Take the first tiny step. Big changes are a small series of tiny steps. Begin small focus on something. Create allies you can horse trade with even if you don’t see eye to eye. Harvey milk teamed up with the teamsters to help them with a boycot they helped him get elected even though they didn’t like him or agree with gay people you need these allies. It’s great if things succeed because they’re right but you need to be practical. You can go further together being right or agreeing doesn’t matter better to stand together than be vanquished alone.

    - **Note:** Kind to others injustice is everywhere and you need to see things from other people's perspective. Make a positive impact on the lives of others. Fighting for the rights of others is fighting for your future rights. Walk a mile in someone's shoes. Big changes are the result of many tiny steps. You need to start small and scale focus on something create allies and find common ground. Practical over ideal and get things done. Go further together
- Holiday is talking about things like ending the slave trade in England or women’s rights where the people in power didn’t have any incentive to make a change so the revolutionary’s appealed to the people and eventually shifted consumer sentiment enough sometimes in years other times decades. Speaking truth to power. Change happens when people get outraged about someone else’s rights. You can’t change anyone but yourself. People changed from people who could be segregated to people who couldn’t you could kill them but they’d no longer accept segregation. Justice isn’t a thing that happens it’s something that’s made. Big plans start small.

    - **Note:** Speak truth to power. You need to allow people to change themselves. Justice is made with small plans that grow big. Change is an internal process and requires a mindset shift. When you cannot make top down change you must fight bottom up. Learning is behavior change.
- Were given talents and we are obligated to make the most of what we’re given we shouldn’t shy away from trying to explore our talents it’s our obligation to use our skills to help the world burying them or saying it’s too hard is abandoning your duty. The aim of life is self development to realize our nature perfectly we shouldn’t be afraid of becoming who we need to be that’s betraying the world. You need to be openly loyal and out in front of curroption not speaking up for someone who helped you isn’t loyalty. Be loyal even when it doesn’t suit your position. Loyalty of something you give not get. Have a North Star and live by it. Do the right thing right now standing on the end of a diving board marked you less likely to dive over time best time to plant a tree is 10 years ago second best is today get action.

    - **Note:** Make the most of your skills and abilities in the moment. Its your obligation to go long your unique differentiation to realize who you are supposed to be who you are. Self realization. Loyalty is vital and defined when its difficult. Get action today bet on yourself
- Choose to be a good person not a great man or hero. Be a good person not a great man. Doing the right and good thing over time makes you great. Be transparent being your ideas in the light don’t hide things be an open book. Be yourself. Make transparency a way of living don’t be embarrassed by your actions. We should want to be the city on the hill and know more about us. Treat people decent. How we treat people when things aren’t going well is a mark of who we are don’t treat a waiter bad just because you can be a good person. Be a decent person only way to fight it is with decency. Everyone struggles be a light in a dark world. What is our duty what should we do here it transcends what is legal doing my job isn’t an excuse it’s a reason to go above and beyond what is expected. Keeping your hands clean and doing the right thing like refusing bribes hurts you but is the right thing in the end. Integrity is sticking to your principals when it’s not popular. It’s going what you think is right not what you can get away with despite the benefits or harm to you. Even when people have no integrity and get ahead you must keep yours.

    - **Note:** Be a good person not a great man. Being good over time makes you great. Be transparent hide in the light. The more people learn about you the better be the city on a hill. Treat people well when things aren’t going well behavior matters most in a crisis. Be a light in a dark world. Have integrity act with a moral compass. Transcend what were legally obligated to do for our moral duty.
- Keeping your word to yourself is justice. Doing the right thing is a debit or credit in who you want to be. When you don’t keep your word you lose trust likewise when you keep it you gain trust. Keep your word tell the truth even when you don’t want to especially when you don’t want to. Never stretch the truth live to your moral code. Honest people don’t bury the lead they embrace the truth. Actively spreading the truth about them even when it hurts. Choose death to honor and truth regardless of the consequences. Never refuse a responsibility. Take responsibility what we do matters and we need to own that what is legal isn’t always right. Do what you should do not what is easiest take extreme ownership. Taking responsibility is hard we are burden and privileged with responsibility from this comes meaning and purpose. We need to hold ourselves accountable. Frank Robinson fined himself when he didn’t run out a hit because he thought it was a home run. Be your own referee set your own standard. The justice we enforce on ourselves are the most important thing we can do. When someone under charges you only you will know but it’s up to us to be honest even when it hurts us. You need to look at yourself in the mirror every day do the things that allow you to do that with a smile. We may lose the game if we give this edge up but we’ll win in life.

    - **Note:** Be a good person doing good or bad things is a debit or credit. Every interaction is a debit or credit on who you’re going to be you need to be a referee of your own actions and live by your own moral code. Rules don’t exist. There’s something you’re enforced on yourself and people aren’t looking and that’s who you become and if you do the right thing over the long Term great things happen. Embrace truth over everything and good things happen. Take extreme ownership of who you want to be. Be honest and live up to your own high standards. Truth over everything. Meaning of life. Your only as good as your word. It’s not a principal unless you give something up.
- Truman was a man who lived by a moral code was a politician in a curropt Missouri but he refused 1.5mm in bribes leading to his mom getting the farm taken away because he he wouldn’t cheat the system anyways acted in this way. He had 2 things on his desk the buck stops between and do the right thing he launched the atomic bomb but believed it was right to save American lives. He had a commission called the Truman commission that did t give handouts and saved the country 15bn after the way he used that money to rescue Europe from a humanitarian crisis. Gave the credit to his friend George Marshall couldn’t take it. Truman grew up a son so slave owners almost joined the kkk in the 1920s but grew the capacity to change his mind and integrated the army. Always did the right thing. Called his rival Eisenhowers son home from Korea to surprise him at his imguation even though Eisenhower hated him. He was just a great person lived a stoic life. He wanted nothing more than the medal do honor but when it was offered to him by Congress he turned it down because he didn’t believe he deserved it because he didn’t earn it in war. Justice isn’t something we demand of other people but ourselves it’s a way of life a practical thing accessible and personal it’s the standards we keep. This isn’t always popular but it ages well the truth ages well. Justice is an internal thing.

    - **Note:** Justice is something we demand of ourselves. A virtue of our lives. Truman always did the right thing even when he was much worse off because of it and that’s the definition of character. He rooted out bribery and corruption. Changed his mind on key issues when he believed he was morally wrong. Virtues don’t come from others. There’s something you give yourself. Strong, moral compass. Values require sacrifice. It’s only a value if you have to give something up otherwise it’s an obvious choice.
- 4 virtues courage temperence justice wisdom were given a choice like Hercules take one path to an easy life of vice where we’ll always be happy or take the more painful path of virtue for initial struggle but a greater end reward. Virtue is something that we must practice every day these cardinal virtues are the key to a good life and must be practiced every day and continuously worked on. Justice has little do do with the law its internal a way of life. Courage putting your ass on the line self discipline getting your ass on the line justice is holding the line. The line between good and evil right and wrong. We feel justice it’s what we have to do regardless of how we feel about our desire. Sense of right and wrong moral of code justice is a noun something we do not something we get. Free yourself by adhering to your own code

    - **Note:** We can choose an easy life of pleasure or meaningful life, which requires sacrifice in pain. Virtues are an active thing not a passive thing. Justice is a duty. You live by your own moral code. Free yourself through self-discipline.
