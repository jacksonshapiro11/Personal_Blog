    - **Note:** Business is problems and effective problem solving orgs are businesses. Elon cut the bs and got down to building not many approvals for things just one.
      High agency and faces failure constantly but grew and pushed through challenges very successful people failing.
      Elon is willing to take risk and have a unique problem solving approach to view things from different angles. High risk and return tolerance.
      The 4th rocket was pieced together after they were so dejected Elon knew to motivate not criticize these people dedicated their wholes lives and it was successful he succeeded where others failed due to grit.
- The Definition of Business and the Art of Problem Solving
  Key takeaways:
  - The definition of business is problems.
  - Success lies in creative, profitable problem solving.
  - The best companies solve problems effectively.
  - Companies are effective problem solving machines.
  - This applies to both products/services and delivering them.
  - SpaceX had to solve financial issues to succeed.
  - Gwynne Shotwell was the president of SpaceX in the early days.

  Speaker 1
  So this is dany mya writing. He sayd stanley's lesson reminded me of something that my grandfather told me. So his grandfather says, the definition of business is problems. His philosophy came down to a simple fact of business life, success lies not in the elimination of problems, but in the art of creative, profitable problem solving. The best companies are those that distinguish themselves by solving problems most effectively. So the way i would distill that down even further, and the way i thought about it when i read that, i'l sak oh, if you think about what he's saying, businesss problems, then that means companies Are just effective problem solving machines. And so this book is all about the problems that space ses had to solve to become space secs. And in case, this also applies to not only ik, what the actual product and service company does, but the problems that a company has to deliver that product in service. So akin space acs, this case, if you want to get to mars, or if you want to start making, initially making more money by by delivering goods to space, well, then you have to the problem to Solve is, how do we get a rocket? The first thing yo hve to do is how do we get a rocket to orbit? Right? A large part of this bit of this book is about the financial issues thet space had to overcome. And the president te gin shotwell, i think e's how you prononce her name, the president ofa space x in the early days. ([Time 0:02:55](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5a11e40e-5332-4fae-ae45-02ecc62f91df))
    - **Note:** Business is problems and companies are effective problem solving machines. The early days are hard but they define the company and struggle. Must sims to throw people off when interviewing them to try to get to the truth. SpaceX is fixing the vacuum in ambition left in the us from the 1970s. Wants to accomplish more not less no one after 1935 has ever walked on the moon. There is no speed limit to building companies you can go as fast as you want. He knows he needs to hire a players. The speed at Tesla was much faster than the industry. Musk read biographies to learn from the mistakes and wins of others. Elon knows all the mistakes of others but has relentless self belief. He gives employees a lot of stock to incentive align them. Wants to make cheaper reusable rockets. Elon lead from the front no job was too small for anyone and Elon was no different around working past midnight. Elon is a great problem solver when he wanted to hire someone but the guy wouldn’t move because his wife worked for google in San Fran Elon called larry page to get her office transferred unapologetically extreme. He’s leading from the front.
- The Benefits of Musk's Rapid Decision-Making
  Key takeaways:
  - Elon Musk made decisions rapidly and wanted to get things done without committees or reports.
  - Musk personally met with every single person the company hired through the first three thousand employees.
  - Musk valued brilliant and hardworking individuals without any nonsense.
  - Steve Jobs also prioritized hiring A players and believed that they preferred working with other A players.
  - Both Musk and Jobs focused on building teams of highly skilled individuals for their companies.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And it's the fact that he made decisions rapidly. Ok? So this guy says he could be very difficult to work for, that's certain, but its early. But early hires would also immediately see the benefits of working for someone who wanted to get things done and made decisions on the spot. When musk decided that a supplier could make good a good part for a fair plight, for a fair price, that was it. No committees, no reports, just done. There's a story that i read, that i learned by reading the book, the everything story about jeff bases. I never forgot tha. I love this guy. Comes in. He's used to working at walmart at the time. He's jeff recruits him over to on to build all other fulfilment centers. And so hehe winds up showing these beautiful plans to jeff about this fulfilment center. And it winds up he's going to wind up spending, it's not just on this fulfilment center, but on a series of him, i think the next, like, 12 months, he's going to wind up spending 300 millions Of amazons money on this. And so he shows the plans to jeff, jeff loves them. And then this guise like, hay, ok, so whod i need to talk to to get to permission to build these? And jeff says, you just did it. So a moron musk's personality over the course of a single meeting, musk could be at turns, at turns hilarious, deadly, serious, penetrating, harsh, reflective and a stickler for the Finest details of rocket science. But most of all, he channelled a preternatural force of moving things forward. Elon, musk just wants to get shit done. Igues, so there is a elon on hiring, which i found really interesting. Reference to earlier, one of musk's most valuable skills was his ability to determine whether someone would fit his mould. His people had to be brilliant, they had to be hard working, and there could be no nonsense there. This is not a direct quote from musk. There are a ton of phonies out there, and not many who were the real deal, as h's talking but his approach to interviewing engineers, i can usually tell within 15 minutes. And i can, i can for sure tell within a few days of working with them. Musk made hiring a priority. He personally met with every single person the company hired through the first three thousand employees. It required late nights and week ends, but he felt im it important to get the right people for his company. So i just happened to be reading some other high lights i did previously on steve jobs again, and he talks about this i'm going to read. Sure this is from isaacson's book on him, but he says, the mack team was an attempt. The mackintosh team was an attempt to build a whole team like that, a player. So he talks about when he came back, ok, actually, let me just read this toou, cause he hasn't got how working at picxsor influence his decision yet. People said theywouldn't get along, meaning all these a players. But they that they would hate working with each other. But i realize that a ayers like to work with a players. They just didn't like working with c players. At pikar, it was a whole company of a players. So he's talking about the time he spent not at apples hewas, working it next and working at picar. He comes back to apple, and he's like, there's, he calls it a bozo explosion. ([Time 0:21:01](https://share.snipd.com/snip/cb9af404-26b7-48d2-95d3-bb9e2198ddb2))
    - **Note:** Elon was hard to work for but made decisions fast when he got a good deal on a part it was done no committees ect. He just wanted to get shit done. Wanted no phonies which there are a ton of but just the real deal. He interviewed the first 3k employees. Elon wants just a players. You can’t build a company of c players and bozos. Elon used an iterative not a linear design building testing adapting early not creating it all in theory then seeing what happens. Default optimists rule the world. Musk is engineering focused and makes the design decision and optimized the engineering org. Musk moved very fast. Big benefit to in housing what was a 1 week feedback loop on engineering design had turned into minutes just turning around and asking questions. Very intense and laxer focused on what they wanted. There were a ton of rocket companies who said the same plan as Elon and failed same with car combpsnies but he succeeded where hundreds had failed and he knew all the failures and still did it anyways.
- Building a Second Launch Site on a Remote Island in the Pacific
  Key takeaways:
  - Two launch sites had to be built, one after the other, requiring a massive amount of work and resources.
  - Supplies had to be transported across the Atlantic and the Pacific using cargo ships and military planes.
  - The accommodations on the remote island were initially basic, and employees compared them to the reality show Survivor.
  - SpaceX designed t-shirts based on the Survivor logo as a reward for employees who survived their first night.
  - It is well-known that the first three rockets launched by SpaceX did not succeed.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  They had just worked themselves to exhaust in building one f one launch site, now they would have to turn around and build a second one, and they have to build that second one on a remote Island h pacific. It's a ton of work they have. They they went up shipping 30 tons of supplies across the atlantic, our shiping, they're acrossing the pacific. It's mine blowing the and the only way youcan get a lot of these things over its s through these giant cargo ships. And in some cases, these giant cargo like military planes. I think the sea 17 is one they use that can hold like a hundred and 60, some crazy amount of weight. I want to sat like a hundred and 60 thousand pounds. It's really unbelievable. And you know, the job is hard when your employees are on the island and they start comparing your the job you're doing to to the reality of you show survivor. Hethe early accommodations were fairly crude on the remote island. They designed tea shirts for overnighters. At the time, the survivor railway television show was really popular, so they used the logo as the basis for the design. Instead of outwit, out, play, out last for a motto like the t v o, the space x tea shirts said, out, sweat out, drink out. Launch, after surviving his or her first night aa space employee would earn a tea shirt. O gright. So a lot of people know the first three rockets aren to fail. ([Time 0:37:58](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0a20e148-e385-499d-bf22-e1dd3dc42e5f))
    - **Note:** The air force told him he could launch from their base thinking he would flame out like the others but when he was ready they didn’t know what to do and dragged their feet Elon wanted to move fast so he worked to secure a remote island in the pacific for the launch they were shipping the materials the next day. They’re living on this uninhabited island basically playing survivor. First 3 rocket launches fail bet the company on the 4th. They give up 4 years of their life for the rocket to blow up after a minute. Elon instead of blowing up at his staff but how hard launching a rocket was in the context of all the other tries to motivate his people. When Gwen shotwell was writing up a plan musk told her he didn’t need plans just action no work about work. Elon was making the engineering and spending decision so he understood the whole picture so he thought deeply about problems.
- Elon Musk's Depth of Thinking and Risk Tolerance
  Key takeaways:
  - Elon Musk uses criticism and doubt as fuel
  - Musk makes spending and engineering decisions himself
  - SpaceX prioritizes optimization and questioning existing solutions
  - Musk has a high risk tolerance and is determined in problem-solving
  - Musk fought against unfair treatment and opened bidding for contracts
  - Reading about others' experiences with failure can be inspiring
  - SpaceX learned the importance of addressing all risks, even the eleventh highest
  - Creating a reusable orbital rocket is an extremely difficult engineering problem
  - Musk's unique thinking and perspective are showcased in the book
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Its an older guy, and he cando like alitle bit patronizing to elon. And elon just uses that, using such ae's using criticism or doubt as fuel. I remember him putting his hand on elon's back and almost hugging him, and saying, son, this is much hardened you think it is. It's never going to work at this remark. Musk's back straightened and he got this look in his eye that shotwell could easily read. And tha just shot, well, talking about the effect of disguised words on musk, he's going to make sure that you regret e moment you said that. This is a unique way elon thinks about balancing engineering with design. Aso says, musk will make snap decisions. This is one of the keys that enable space to move so quickly. I make the spending decisions and the engineering decisions in one head. He said. Normally those are at least two people. There's some engineer, engineering guy, who's trying to convince a finance guy that his money should be spent. But the finance guy doesn't understand engineering, so he can't tell if it's a go way to spend money or not. Whereas i'm making the engineering decisions and spending decisions. So i know already that my brain trusts itself. What a unique sentence, my brain trusts itself. So this is more on how lanmus thinks must taugt his team to assest every part of the rocket with a discerning eye. Brian remembers being constantly challenged for any given task. A typical aerspace company would just use whatever part has always been used. Four. This saved engineers from time consuming, difficult work of qualifying a new part for space flight. But spacebit space x's attitude was different. True, a product may already exist, but is it optimized for your solution? So these are just a series of questions that bryan is talking about. The musk wod would have you go through, right? Is it optimize for your solution? Isi, is it from a good supplier? And what about their two their tear two or three suppliers? And if you more of this part faster, will they meet your needs? And if you want to change something, are they going to be willing to change it. And if you improve that product, will they then sell it to your competitors? That is not normal. And that's a way, that's a great illustration of the level depth of the sinking member. He's a crazy person, but thereis a very ordered way to his thinking that's just very, it's, it's satisfying to read. I's the weird way. I would put it more on how musk thinks and works. Ah, this is one of the things that elon brought to spacees, space, risk tolerance. He didn't want to fail, but he wasn't afraid of it. Shot well on musk. The quality she come to admire most about musk is his determined mind set to identify problems and devise solutions. He looks at a problem and his reaction isn't, oh, that's a shame. His reaction is, go fix it. He's extraordinary. So elon also makes a decision i think not many people would't do. He sues a potential customer, which as nassau. And he does this in very early days because he felt there was, this is the same thing andy beale ran up to, that there was like this croneism up there, where you have all these established Suppliers. They have good relations to bnassa. They are the ones getting unfair treatment. Elon si, listen, i don't want unfair treatment. I just want you to open up your process, to open bits, let us bid for it. And looking back, it appears he's definly right to do this. At the time, it's just a crazy thing that elon did, but he was right. A the suppliers nassa was using, they were building some of the world's most expensive rockets. I'm so to his point, like, i can't, i can't accomplish my goal if rocketry costs are going in the opposite direction. I need to go them cheaper. We're going more expensive. So he winds up, ah, i think it's the office of government, the government, the government ac accountability office. Ok, there it is. Ok. So that's what they want. Upsiding with e alans like, no, you got, you can't just give out a 227 million dollar contract, like, you got to open this up. And so the government accountability office a winds up agreeing. So anywaystha, there's, if yu interested the longerstoryin the book, i need to tell you what i'm more intre is, like how this story is an illustration of how elan thinks, and this is him Describing it to us. I was told by many people that we should not protest. You've got a 90 % chance thatyou're going to lose. You're going to make a potential customy an, a customer angry. I'm like, it seems like the right is on our side here. It seems like this should go out for tition. And if we don't fight this, then i think we're doomed. Anyways. Our chances of success would be dramatically lowered. Nassa, being one of the biggest customers of space launch, would be cut off from us. I had to protest. So again, ibays, soig, don't do his on dui. There is no other option. I absolutely have to. And he windsi obviously being correct. Ah. And then he keeps on this fight. There's just a great sentence here to describe elon. In the early days of space exn read o here, in a second, says that in one battle, space ex and northo grunman a traded lawsuits over rocket engine technology. Another battle, space x sued boming and locky martin over plans to mergeer launch business into a sing and single rocket company. Within hits first three years, space ex had sued three of its biggest rivals in the launch industry, gone against the air force with the proposed united launch alliance merger and protested A nassa contract. Elon must was not walking on egg shells on his way to orbit. He was breaking a lot of eggs. And so right after this, they went up getting a contract from nasset's the first 200, seventyeight million dollars they get. And it really changedte space xs forever. Obviously, they still ould hav went out of business because they hadn't put i a rocket in orbit yet when they got they contract. But with that contract, they at least weren't, they knew, o, as long as we solvee of getting into orbit, we should, you know, at least survive for another few years. I would say, though, the one of the main benefits of reading this book is that you're constantly exposed to smart, dedicated people having to deal with failure. And it's just, again, ev it dosn't matter what you do, you're going to run into this. And so when you you see other people, and you'r reading thexperience of other people have to deal with. I think is iti very inspiring. And you'll think back to these things in your own life. Inevitably, in the future, we're gong, i'm goingto try to do something that' ging to fail in the future. 100 %, you are as well. Okay, this is just something to deal with. Let me see how other people dealt with it. After the merlin engine failed and the rocket tumbled toward the ocean, their excited shouts and chatter died. No one was quite sure what to say. I was in shock, because we spent so much time putting that rocket together, and then to see it quickly break into pieces on the ground, it was shocking. And what makes this even worse is they knew the problem is, it's called slashing. So as the rocket goes up, the fuel can move around. If it moves around too much, it's going to make the rocket, like, lose control. But the reason it's something is a risk they wanted to accept. Because een on before this, he's like, givi me your top ten like risks that you think what for all the engineers? What are the top tin thingstht, we had to focus on the... ([Time 0:43:42](https://share.snipd.com/snip/42364b48-1d5a-473e-8cec-f92e6cfeacb3))
    - **Note:** Elon understood the system and used second and 3rd level thinking. Used doubt as fuel. Very clear and ordered thinking he has a risk tolerance willing to take risks even if it means failing. He looks at a problem and just thinking about fixing it not woe is me. He sues nasa in order to get open contracts. Which was suing a key customer and was likely to make them angry. He had to protest or else the company was doomed they needed an open launch to have a chance. They sued everyone to get rid of some of the cronyism and clear a path for them to launch this lead to their 270mm contract with nasa that saved the company. Story of the book is smart and dedicated people dealing with failure. They were done in by sloshing which was their 11 highest risk. They only addressed and accepted the top 10 now they go to 11.
- Chief Engineer's Crisis at SpaceX
  Key takeaways:
  - The fourth and final rocket launch was in a rush due to financial constraints.
  - Don, in a quick-thinking move, crawled into the crumpling rocket mid-flight and saved it.
  - The engineers at SpaceX questioned their abilities after several failures and a dismal record.
  - Elon Musk felt crestfallen and believed that the third launch was their last.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Now, this is very important, because on their fourth and final a rocket launch, they have to tran it's in a rush. They have lik a few weeks to do it. Elon wasn't planning on doing a fourth launch ecause he was about to run oun money. S. Have to take the rocket over by on c 17. And it starts, because of the difference in air pressure, the rocket starts crumpling in the plane, and it could destroy the rocket. Don is the one that has to crawl in mid flight, therely 25 thousand feet in the air, mid flight, into a crumpling rocket. Ind wont of opening these vents that's going to normalize the pressure anyways. But he wants up saving the rocket. And i thought that was very interestingat it could have, if that didn't happen, the rocket, the fourth successful attempt might never have occurred if it wasn't for don crawling into The rocket in the back of this giant c 17 and fixing itea fast, really quick thinking. And to think that he might not even been hired if hed just saiy ok, ok, call me when you want. He said, no, no, no. I'm not doing that. I want to do this. I'll go right now. And he winds up driving out, like, almost immediately. So i just think there's a lot o, i love that turn of events. And i think there's a lot of wisdom unti it what this young, young guy did. But i want to talk about the third failure. I want, this is a part of the book where i think it is really, really helpful for us put ourselves in the shoes of the people going through this. Because they are now spent, in elan's case, almost a hundred million of his own money, which is insane that he would even do that to begin with. But also, like, years and years this. This is not like a normal nine to five, money through friday job. They are giving their lives to this this is, in many cases, they were obsess or rocket since they were kids, and they're failing. And this is where the benefit of books is like, you get to see and live multiple lives. Ray. And so this is the chief engineer, thi sky has dedicated his life to rockets, and now he's wandering sie, i'm, i'm not. Am i not actually good at my job? Like i thought i was im passioned aboutit? I learnt. I work at it a lot. I study. I'm not good at it. Was bad luck, to be sure, but space es had run through a lot of bad luck over the years. And bad luck only gets you so far as an excuse. Maybe they just weren't that good. Certainly there could be no denying the company's dismal record. Space ex had launched three times with kingman, that's the sky's name, playing an important part in all three missions. Thiss, the chief engineer, is like, i am not good at my job. Now thanow this, were going to go to musk again. Imagine, imagine being in his shoes at this moment. Musk felt as crestfallen as the rest of his employees worse. Even. Remember, they thought, this is the third, final lunch. They thought it was over. ([Time 0:53:46](https://share.snipd.com/snip/87252b18-9e57-49e4-807b-3900f0a350ed))
    - **Note:** These people are so persistent and love this they’ve dedicated their lives to rockets and they were failing the chief engineer was giving up on himself there was serious personal doubt from everyone. They had failed at 3 launches and were out of money no chance to raise more this wasn’t a 9-5 they dedicated their lives. Elon himself had gotten divorced but instead is playing the blame game with this massive failure he once again rallies the troops. They had enough parts left for one more rocket Elon gets them to build and launch it in 6 weeks because they didn’t have time. They fixed the problem they had in the last flight in a week this is their last chance. Working entire life to do something constantly failing then suddenly validation and success at the death. This was their whole life this book is 95% failure leading to one success. Missionary not mercenary. Talent wins over experience and entrepreneurial culture over heritage half the best rocket scientist out of one college took pay cuts out of college to go to space x and do something. Passion that fires success.
