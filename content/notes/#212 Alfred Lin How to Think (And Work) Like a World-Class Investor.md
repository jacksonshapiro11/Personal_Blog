### Highlights

- **Working Backwards vs. Forwards**
  * Visualize the ideal future state (working backwards).
  * Map out the steps from the present to achieve it (working forwards).
  * Important to meet in the middle to see if it’s both viable and you’re on the right track.

  What's the difference between working backwards and working forwards?
  Alfred Lin
  So working backwards is this idea that Amazon popularized, which was you start with the vision of the world that you want to imagine, and you think about if everything goes right, what Is the world that we live in and what does this product become that you're trying to build and we at sequoia we call that the pre-parade and you know if everything goes right with this company What does it become and then you work backwards from there what what is you know one one year before that what does it look like two years before that what does it work look like and amazon Popularized by working backwards meaning that go from the future all the way to today um and i love that concept in a sense um but i've also seen lots of founders struggle to take it from Future, which they have this great vision of the world, and really map it all the way back to today. They map it somewhere five years out, 10 years out, but they can't map it today. And I also tell founders, okay, that's the future that you're aiming for. Here are the realities of today. What does it look like one year ahead, two years ahead, three years ahead? That's working forwards. And if the two don't match, you're not on the same trajectory. When you work backwards and you think you have a great plan and then you mis-execute and you don't know that you're not executing, it's because you haven't worked forwards on what the Year one, two, and three look like to be on that trajectory.
