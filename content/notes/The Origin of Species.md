- As many more individuals of each species are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, there is a frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, will have a better chance of surviving, and thus be naturally selected. From the strong principle of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form. ([Location 67](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QPM6VVS&location=67))

    - **Note:** There is a struggle for survival so any slight advantage will lead to a better chance of survival and be naturally selected for and passed down, but the ecosystem is complex so the best may not be fully optimized but most anti fragile depends on the ecosystem
