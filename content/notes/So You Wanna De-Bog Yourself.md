- Full Title: So You Wanna De-Bog Yourself
- Category: #articles

- Summary: The article offers advice on how to get "unstuck" when feeling overwhelmed with life's challenges. The author compares the feeling of being stuck to standing knee-deep in a bog and offers a catalog of bog phenomena that keep people stuck, such as waiting for a jackpot, declining the dragon, and puppeteering. The author suggests that many of these bogs are imaginary and that getting out of them requires accepting that one's perception of reality is not necessarily reality.

### Highlights

- This is *gutterballing*: excelling, but in slightly the wrong direction. For most of its journey, after all, the gutterball is getting closer to the pins. It's only at the end that it barely, but dramatically, misses.
  Gutterballing is a guaranteed way to stay stuck in the bog because people will love you for it. “You're doing the right thing!” they'll shout as you sink into the swamp. “We approve of this!”
  ***Waiting for jackpot***
  Sometimes when I'm stuck, someone will be like, “Why don't you do [reasonable option]?” and I'll go, “Hold on there, buddy! Don't you see this option has *downsides*? Find me one with only upsides, and then we'll talk!”
  I'm *waiting for jackpot*, refusing to do anything until an option arises that dominates all other options on all dimensions. Strangely, this never seems to happen. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmpdp8nqw1nkp03ceneqkqeg))

    - **Note:** velocity vs speed going the right direction and waiting for perfection in an imperfect world you just need to get action. Dont wait for perfect and don't be too close minded/ not introspective enough to know when you're going down the wrong path
- ***Floor is lava***
  Every kid learns to play the “floor is lava” game, where you pretend that you'll get incinerated if you touch the carpet. Even toddlers can pick it up, which reveals something profound: very early on, we acquire the ability to pretend that fake problems are real. We then spend the rest of our lives doing exactly that.
  Often, when I’m stuck, it’s because I've made up a game for myself and decided that I’m losing at it. I haven’t achieved enough. I am not working hard enough and I am also, somehow, not having enough fun. These games have elaborate rules, like “I have to be as successful as my most successful friend, but everything I've done so far doesn't count,” and I’m supposed to feel very bad if I break them. It’s like playing the absolute dumbest version of *the floor is lava*.
  Did I create these games by thinking really hard about how to live a good life? No! I pulled them out of my butt. Or someone else pulled them out of *their* butt, and I said, “Ooh, can I have some of that?” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmpdwa19zxwvesck7349ncr4))
    - **Note:** Don't make fake problems real. Often problems are these mental inventions that actually mean nothing but we convince ourselves are real. Diploma problem one you work on for a long time and accomplish like riding a bike a toothbrushing problem is one where you need to keep working every day
