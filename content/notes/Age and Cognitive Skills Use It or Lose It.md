  Hanushek et al., Sci. Adv. 11, eads1560 (2025) 5 March 2025 average never face a skill decline (at least until the limit of our data at age 65). Consistent with the assumptions of prior studies, usage interacts closely with a variety of background characteristics. Thus, both literacy and numeracy skills keep increasing for white-­collar and tertiary-­educated workers in the second half of their working life if they have above-­median skill usage, but not if skill usage is below the median. Skill evolution also varies by gender: Women show steeper skill decline at older ages, especially in numeracy ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpg9papatwz93sp9yyvrqkzm))
    - **Note:** Use it or lose it with skills
- Notably, those with above-­median usage of each respective skill on average never show a decline in skills in the observed age range (Fig. 3). Their skills increase steeply into the fifties and then flatten out, with no indication of average decline. By contrast, for those with below-­median usage, skill decline begins in their mid-­thirties. In contrast to the aggregate pattern, the usage-­specific patterns are quite similar for the two skill dimensions. Again, the pattern is qual- itatively unchanged when disregarding individuals younger than 25 in the analysis (fig. S5). These results are consistent with skill usage playing a leading role in determining whether skills are gained, retained, or lost over time.

    - **Note:** When you constantly use skills your abiliy doesn't decline it increases despite age and confounding data
