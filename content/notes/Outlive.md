### Highlights

- Change the conditions that cause issues. Fast death gun shots vs slow death cancer. We don’t focus on the initial conditions for slow death. We need to Lengthen our health span and stop slow death. Elongate our healthspan. Slow death is so far away from the beginning in when it’s too late. Be proactive not reactive. Intervene before the issue by the time cancer sets in it’s too late. It’s been 5 years too late. He wanted to learn more so he sought out field experts who were eager to help just asking you need to or else you have no chance. We view these issues as point in time not the product of years bad dogma. Importance of protein the right type of exercise and Mental health

    - **Note:** Long term mindset and systems not point view of issues. By the time we have one of these existential slow death issues it’s 5 years too late. Smaller changes over time vs drastic changes. Think ahead of time be proactive.
- Peter was in a rigid culture that didn’t value change in innovation and he made a shocking decision to leave with only two years left after committing six years of his life. Bold decision that pans out. First do no harm is wrong everything has risk and return you need to make positive EV decisions. If someone is about to die you can do a lot of harm. Medicine 1.0 was science existed and we could control our destiny. Medicine 2.0 was germ theory before this there was no understand of microscopy. We haven’t expanded lifespan past the top couple infectious diseases we’ve solved. We need to better understand risk factors over time. Evolve our mindset toward medicine for medicine 3.0. 1. Start with prevention not treatment 2. Treat everyone as unique not the same. 3 we must embrace risk and return. Understand how this general study maps to our specific case. 4 focus more on healthspan than lifespan. Insurance companies pay for medicine not for healthy diets and gym memberships. Treatment over prevention. We should focus on 30-40 year risk not 10 year risk the more foresight the less you need to course correct. Medicine 3.0 is about agency you can’t be passive.

    - **Note:** Medicine is too general and doesn’t vote domain dependence or risk return properly. Medicine 3.0 is taking a more wholistic systems view of the problem and optimizing for health over lifespan. Preventative medicine
      Peter was in med school and decided to completely change his life and do something different strayed from the path.
      Medicine is about intelligent risk return trade offs.
- Strategy vs tactics - strategy is your over arching goal and tactics is how you achieve that. Ali beat foreman by being quicker mentally tougher and better conditioned and tactically he used the ropadope and got him angry wearing him out for an all victory. Tactics what you do in the ring. Strategy your plan before it. Study opponent abs find out strengths and weaknesses. Objective strategy tactics. Optimize your health for resilience.

- Rapimicen helps slow aging and cell division. This drug showed significant life expectancy increase in mammals for the first time ever. It does this by turning down mtor. This is because it reduces consumption eating less can help elongate life. The first diet book on caloric restriction was written in 16th century by an Italian man named Luigi who almost died in 40s but lived to 80s. Exercise and caloric restriction lead to more atopgagy with recycles and gets rid of old unproductive cells. This is like taking out the garbage and is important to do but declines over time. We take out less trash. What we eat and how we metabolize it has a big effect on our health. Rapimicen has side effects but with intermittent instead of daily dosing those may be mitigated.

    - **Note:** Rapimicen is a revolutionary drug and could lead to longer lives. The virtues of exercise and caloric restrictions date back centuries and have lindy. Nutrition is simple not easy. Atophagy is like anti fragility of cells the more stress the more your weak cells get replaced and their nutrients recycled for stronger cells.
- Average is not healthy. The average weight of men has gone from 173 to 200, but a 200 pound average man isn’t healthy. When we can’t regulate are metabolism we start having problems. We need to mitigate how much fat splits into our organs. It’s normal to have fat under the skin but when it gets into the organs things get bad. Metabolic issues and i overconsumption of sugar through soft drinks and smoothies can negatively effect/ really hurt our metabolism. Weight is a proxy but not the problem. Insulin resistance sees insulin rise and keep rising not just rise and fall with sugar intake.

    - **Note:** Average is not metabolically healthy just because the average weight is 200 pounds doesn't mean the people are healthy. Weight is a correlation but not a causation effect of metabolic health
- Cholesterol starts accumulating young and builds up in the body until it’s too late. It can start as early as 16-23 for a heart attack in middle age. We need to be proactive with this. Lp little a is a huge predictor of heart issues getting a cholesterol scan often is vital for health. 2 types one does just calcium one can test and find soft future calcium do that because it’s more info even if a little radiation. Apo B is a leading bad cause of heart disease. Carson events accumulate over 20-30 years but medicine 2.0 only looks at 10 year risk. Look at causal factors not just age. Keep apo a and apo b as low as in children.

    - **Note:** This takes a systems approach to health and cholesterol
- Cancer is complex and evolves and grows in different ways. Not only is colon cancer different from breast cancer but breast cancer is different from other breast cancers. Control metabolic health. Cancer can be aided by system interventions not point interventions where you make holistic lifestyle changes to diet and exercise instead of just doing chemo. Immunotherapy is different drugs that enhance the body’s immunity and attack different areas of the body/cells to kill the cancer cells with the own cells in the body. Immunotherapy can present longe lifespans and better hope for cancer cures along with early detection helps lengthen life. Sensitivity specificity accuracy and base rates. If you have a 90% specificity but 1% of the pool has the disease you will have 10% false positives. Early tests are important to managing cancer but can have a big psychological effect but too early is better than too late.

    - **Note:** Cancer is a system problem and every cancer is different to cure it you need wholistic intervention. Immunotherapy and cancer. The importance of statistics false positives specificity vs accuracy.
- Peter had a patient that had 12x the normal risk for Alzheimer’s. He told her up front and directly and it’s important to understand what this means and doesn’t mean. It isn’t a death sentence but it’s also not great. Delivered bad news quickly. Alzheimer’s and other brain diseases can be staved off using and building cognitive and movement reserves through complex motion. Alzheimer’s may be the result of reduced blood flow to the brain and thus glucose. A drop in energy to the brain. Exercise and good diet are the best ways to cure these diseases. Saunas can also stunt Alzheimer’s. Because there is no treatment we need a medicine 3.0 approach.
    - **Tags:** #proactively, #medicine-3.0, #alzheimer's, #bad-news-upfront
    - **Note:** Alzheimer’s risk is best reduced with exercise and mental fitness increases. We can’t cure we need to prevent. Tell bad news up front.
- The world has changed a lot but humans have remained roughly unchanged. Start with the big trends then drill into tactics. Mentally flexible not choosing a side or team but using what you think is best and ruthlessly changing your mind when you’re wrong.

    - **Note:** Human nature is unchanging start with the goal strategy then drill into the tactics. Be mentally flexible in your execution
- Vo2 max has a bigger effect on all cause mortality than anything else. The bottom 20% are at 4x the risk and the middle 40-60 are at 2x the risk vs the top people. Smokers are only 1.4x the risk of non smokers. Muscle mass is also vital and strength could be more predictive than vo2 max. We shouldn’t optimize for 1 area but have a well rounded athletic portfolio. Do more now and train for what you want to be able to do later in life.
    - **Tags:** #systems-thinking, #vo2-max, #muscle-mass, #strength-training, #complex-adaptive-systems, #health-vs-life-span
    - **Note:** vo2 max and muscle mass are big predictors of stregthn have a well rounded body by optimizing for system health
- We want to be able to use a similar amount of glucose and fat. Metabolic flexibility the ability to use glucose and fat. Zone 2 training is vital. 4 45 minute sessions a week is needed or 3 hours. This is measured by the talk test to more specifically by lactic acidosis in the blood. Take average wattage for zone 2 divide by weight that is your watts per kg. 1 is bad 2 is good 4 is world class. Raising this is your marker of success. Vo2 max is key to health and declines 10-15% a year more as we get older so it’s vital to have a high Vo2 max as early as possible. You can always improve your Vo2 max no matter how old you are and you can aim to have a lower Vo2 max which is literally turning back the aging clock. Vo2 max work out is 4 minutes high intensity then 4 minute relax and do it 4-6 of these intervals.
    - **Tags:** #barbell, #exercise, #medicine-3.0, #zone-2-training, #vo2-max
    - **Note:** Vo2 max and zone 2 training are a vital nutrition to barbell. It’s important to metabolize fat and sugars. This all atrophies so you need to keep training to even maintain but the body can recover at almost any age.
- A loss in bone density leads to a drastic decrease in activity and we must maintain lean muscle mass to remain healthy. Focus on protein and strength training to enhance bones. Mark of health is how much heavy stuff you can carry. We build these stores over time and these carrying exercises like rucking or kettle bells help maintain our strength. Using rows as well as grip strength is vital. Essentric and consentric loading. Stability training.
    - **Tags:** #muscle-mass, #stability-training, #nutrition, #protein-consumption, #bone-density, #exercise, #strength-training, #robust
    - **Note:** We need to eat a lot of protein and work out. This keeps our muscles and bones healthy lowering our metabolic rate.
- Stability is vital we need to enhance stability and avoid chronic pain. Rather have a stable base than big muscles without anything below. Stability is vital and that is how you breathe and how your body interacts with the world every day. Breathing test hand on belly and chest and lie down seeing which hand rises. It could be neither. Lie down with legs up on bench or chair inhale quietly. Intra abdominal pressure is vital to stability training. There are work outs I should look up. Other key areas for stability feet spine shoulders and fingers. We must do the right form and go slow so we can go fast.

    - **Note:** Stability is vital for our health we must build from the ground up and constantly layer things on to add strength to slow to go fast. Important to be stable over everything because you need a strong foundation. Shows how the body is a system interconnected.
- Nutrition 3.0. We need to eat less and have more lean nutrition. Nutrition shouldn’t be a focus but nutritional biochemistry is key and nutrition studies have so many confounding factors it’s tough to discern what is real and what’s correlation. While diets work for some people studies are confounding and results are specific to people one group could have had a great reaction to one diet while another had no reaction or even a adverse reaction. We must look at nutritional biochemistry.
    - **Tags:** #domain-dependence, #nutrition, #medicine-3.0, #nutritional-biochemistry, #different-things-for-different-people
    - **Note:** High level we need to eat less and obviously better food but past that each body react differently to food and we need to optimize for our nutritional biochemistry
- SAD - standard American diet that has is mostly eating highly processed sugars which leads to much less hunger but doesn’t help our nutritional or diet problems because evolutionarily food is scarce so we haven’t adapted not to want it all the time. In our diet we must restrict how much we eat by portion control, food restrictions, or time restrictions. CR, DR, TR caloric dietary and time restrictions. At the end of the day we just need to eat less. A good way to do this is to track your calories. The monkey study showed that the monkeys fed the healthier diet showed less benefit from caloric restriction than the monkeys in the study with the less health diet. The two studies were confounding but viewed through the lense of the processed foods in one trial vs natural in the other it showed CR was much more important when the food quality was low but when it was good natural food CR had less of an effect and the monkeys even ate 10% less in the NIH vs the Wisconsin study so this showed the importance of caloric restriction within limits is not as important as food quality but eating to excess is metabolically unhealthy so you need to avoid excess eating. Outside of gross over nourishment food quality proved to be a bigger factor in health while the benefits of CR are important but less so than eating the right food. Ultimately it’s about finding the diet that works for you that you can adhere to that has ample healthy natural foods doesn’t skimp on the protein and avoids over nourishment. Alcohol is very bad for you. Continuous glucose monitoring is better than yearly tests that gives your body a sense of what it’s eating and how it reacts to different foods. Tighter feedback loops. Usually people need a couple months in cgm to figure out how foods effect then and how to tailor a diet that best fits them. First month is about noticing then it’s about adjusting to what works. It’s helpful to see how sleep stress ect feeds into your glucose. Helps you understand how different foods with the same macros effect you like rice and sugar cereal. It also gives you a sense of how portion spacing out and timing during the day effect your glucose. If you’re really stressed your sugar can spike in the middle of the night. Cgm isn’t everything but the combination of all the factors it reveals makes you net healthier.

    - **Note:** Cgms are valuable because the tighten feedback loops but it’s alot due to nutritional biochemistry everyone is different
      Diets and nutrition are important and the quality as well as quantity are important avoid the sad and control portions find which food and diets work for you. Avoiding excess and bad things as if not more important than anything. Alcohol is very bad for you.
- Protein we should consume almost 1:1 body mass to protein grams a day. Lucine lycene and methynene (3-4 grams a day of the first ti and 1 of the last one). To increase lean mass you need more lucine 2-3 grams x 4 serving. Protein is vital to body function. Fat types Mono unsaturated poly unsaturated and saturated. We should have 50% mono unsaturated, 15-20% saturated “, and the rest poly unsaturated like fish oils. Mono unsaturated fats are the best for you but after that it’s likely poly then saturated but the data isn’t very clear and it’s very person specific. Likely omega 3 is needed as a supplement unless you eat a ton of fish. Fasting is inconclusive and the data isn’t conclusive it helps people. It can lead to more binging during eating windows and the other benefits are not well proven. It can be also hard to hit protein targets when fasting. With fasting may work to reduce calories the benefits may come at the cost of lean mass. True fasting is good in extreme cases where it’s so bad that the patient needs a big intervention but outside of that the trade off is minimal. Nutrition is really just a calories in calories out games and outside of extreme cases nutrition seeks to optimize but will not produce a sea change.

    - **Note:** eat proteins and good fats everything is person specific fasting may help but its really about optimizing the nutritional system of the whole. There are no silver bullets but nutrition is common sense mixed with nutritional biochemistry
- Bad sleep less than 7 hours has a really bad long term effects but is vital for memory and health. Compromised sleep lead to much worse performance than someone who is well rested less sleep cam increase stress. Deep sleep likely sorts our brain and clears a lot of useless knowledge while rem sleep helps make connections and increase thought. Sleeping is very important and you gotta do it. Darkness is key to sleeping. Keep your room cold and give up on alcohol which leads to being sedated not sleeping. Fix your bed and wake up time.
    - **Tags:** #long-term-mindset, #sleep-(importance-of), #sleep-techniques, #medicine-3.0
    - **Note:** Sleep is vital and you need a dark room and not drinking and a regular bed time and deep sleep/rem sleep have different benefits.
- Mental health is vital and we all process trauma differently. Adversity is good but we need to respond well to it not poorly. Our coping mechanisms define our response. Emotional health isn’t just mental health diseases but emotional states and relationships as well. We need to be practice with a 3.0 approach of proactive medicine. Most of anger is hopelessness masquerading as frustration. This gets passed through generations and we need to be brave to stand in its face. Reframing a situation is about understanding others and gaining empathy. David foster Wallace we only ever see the world through our eyes with us at the center of our universe and everyone sees this way. Reframe the situation to encompass the entire system of feelings. Resume vs eulogy virtues. The external relationships are vital but what’s more important is the inner monologue your relationship with yourself. Are you constantly bashing yourself and being self loathing is this the best thing for your health calling yourself a worthless piece of shit. Who cares about your resume when you’re so miserable. Peter had a psychotic episode moved to a motel and then finally decided to go back to a mental health facility. Perfectionism and feelings of worthlessness took their toll. Dbt as a type of therapy to regulate your emotions and understanding when you’re drifting. Changing the behavior can change the mood. We need to control the voice in our head no one can hurt is more than we can hurt ourselves.

    - **Note:** We need to control the voice in our head and dictate and improve our inner monologue. Don't bash yourself and call yourself a piece of shit this doesn't help. Adversity is bad when we don't process it well.
      Medicine 3.0 mental health isn't just awareness to disease but day to day feelings and mental states. Understand the system of our feelings. Reframe the situation to understand and gain empathy.
      Most of anger is hopelessness masquerading as frustration.
      Resume vs eulogy virtues.
      Hate and adversity gets passed through generations and we need to stop this cycle for ourselves and children
