### Highlights

- **Real’s first book,** “I Don’t Want to Talk About It: Overcoming the Secret Legacy of Male Depression,” is an extended disquisition on male pain and loneliness, rooted in the belief that men are depressed because they’re terrible at intimacy. They’re terrible at intimacy because their capacities for it were extinguished in childhood.
  It doesn’t have to be this way, Real argues. We condition boys to repress their feelings, desires and ability to connect. It’s no surprise, then, that so many of them grow up to be half-men — depressed, lonely, angry and empty. “Too often,” he writes, “the wounded boy grows up to become a wounding man, inflicting upon those closest to him the very distress he refuses to acknowledge within himself.” The real kicker is that often they don’t even know this is happening. They’re just acting out or shutting down, blindly.
  Published in 1997, “I Don’t Want to Talk About It” was the first book to give voice not just to the choked pain of depressed men but also of their suffering partners. Almost three decades later, it still reads well. What strikes me now, maybe more than it would have struck a reader back in the ’90s, is how wise the book is about the role that power plays in all this. This is a through line in all of Real’s work: the necessity of exercising power in relationships but also the profound difference between wielding it in loving relation to others and using it to dominate them. He is not asking men to sacrifice their power to their partners. He asks that we stop exercising power the way little boys do — with tantrums, bullying, sulking, hitting, silence — whenever someone tries to talk to us about feelings. In the place of our well-crafted defenses, he insists, we should aspire to “fierce intimacy”: a healthy inversion of the wounded intensity of the traumatized person.

    - **Note:** suppressing feelings is bad
- He calls this “relational empowerment,” a subtle but profound shift from the individualistic focus so central to our culture of therapy, self-help and self-care. The goal is to develop the strength to confront your own traumas so that you can be better for and demand more of your loved ones. “All over this culture, you have people moving from disempowerment to what I call individual empowerment,” he says. “‘I was weak, now I’m strong, go fuck yourself.’ Relational empowerment is: ‘I was weak, now I’m strong. I’m bringing my strength into this relationship. I’m telling you what I need. I’m being assertive. I love you. What do you need from me to help you do this?’ ” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jm0gv1dw2jg46zerzh8ahkvs))
    - **Note:** relational empowerment
- Real talks a lot, in his book and in our sessions, about the “adaptive child” — the part of us that evolves to survive in the hostile terrain of childhood. It’s what allows us to defer until later in life the distress that we don’t have the resources to process when we’re young. Now it’s later, though. If our adaptive child is still running the algorithms for our adult relationships, we’re in trouble.
  In the footage, Real tells me to knock it off. I remember hearing him, but only sort of. His observation cut so close to my core stance in the marriage, which is perhaps also my core fear: If I don’t scream for what I need, I will not be loved. I said none of this in the session. Instead I protested, articulately but lamely, that I was making progress. I’m better than I was a few years ago, I hear myself say in the recording, and I was better a few years ago than I was a few years before that. I’m not trying to excuse my bad behavior, but don’t I get some credit for the trend line moving in the right direction?
  Real isn’t impressed.
  “Your expectations of your own progress are pretty mediocre at best,” he says. “Just transpose it to the physical. Well I only hit her twice this year. The year before that I hit her 12 times. Am I doing better? No. Not on my watch. How about cleaning it up all together? How about stopping it?” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jm0kf1bjeqet9gbek8qgp539))
