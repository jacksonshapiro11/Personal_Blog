### Highlights

- Episode AI notes
  1. Valuation assumptions in investment models can be assessed by reverse engineering the market price and identifying the probability distribution of the assumptions needed to support it. John Bur Williams introduced the framework for discount cash flow models in 1938, and tools can be used to forecast value when it becomes too complex.
  2. Teaching security analysis is a well-established subject, with versions by Graham and others. The speaker has been teaching it since 1993 and has focused on competitive strategy for nearly 20 years. Synthesizing different concepts in competitive strategy can be challenging, especially when it comes to measuring its effectiveness.
