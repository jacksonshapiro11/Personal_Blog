### Highlights

- Episode AI notes
  1. Despite suffering from chronic illnesses and a troubled childhood, Theodore Roosevelt developed a love for adventure through stories passed down from his wealthy southern family. His debilitating asthma attacks were soothed by tales of guns, violence, and savage death from his ancestors, igniting his passion for the outdoors and setting him apart from the office and factory life of the Northeast.
  2. Theodore Roosevelt, one of the most accomplished people ever lived, had the same feelings of joy, terror, sorrow, grief, and self-doubt as everyone else. Despite feeling diminished and engulfed by self-doubt, Roosevelt kept trying to make his father proud. Roosevelt's response to the death of his father and overwhelming grief is explored in this part.
  3. There is value in learning from the past. Reading about the experiences of great people can be productive. Knowledge leads to increased capability. Don't procrastinate, take action now. ([Time 0:00:00](https://share.snipd.com/episode-takeaways/47ef064a-a1c7-4cee-8e31-9806131e1e01))

His body was naturally weak so he built it up grew through hardship always action always trial by fire never a wasted moment always adventure.
- Vital to have someone believe in you and to tell you they believe in you. His dad died young when Teddy was in college he idolized his dad and his death threw him into a deep depression and self doubt but Teddy pulled himself up and out of the situation to be the man he was. Everyone has these moments when they think they’re nothing and question everything they are and have done. He learns to deal with emotional pain through physical exertion. He’s all grit he’ll kill himself before he says he’s tired. He was incapable of indifference and horribly competitive and thought he could do things better than anyone else to prove things to himself. He felt inferior to his dad and this motivated him for the rest of his life to prove his worthiness to himself. He was a constant and deep observer of the world who had a childlike sense of wonder with everything that happened to him.

    - **Note:** Importance of self belief and role models. His dad’s death shook him to his core and he dug deep and molded himself willing to die for success. We all have pivotal moments and inflection points that determine our lives. Dealing with hardship. Felt the need to prove himself deep observer of the world and very curious
      Everyone has these moments when they think they’re nothing and question everything they are and have done. Your response defines you. Very curious. Motivated constantly by being better and becoming a person he admires. We all hit our rock bottom and do we let it consume us or do we remind ourselves of that low and does it transform us into who we want to be. Are you taking the lessons from the past to make you who you want to be?
      Inflection points in our lives and growth through hardship
- He was always trying to learn and learn from others he would hold full conversations while speed reading the newspapers in the morning. He saw everything and formed an opinion on everything zest for life didn’t waste a moment he would literally run up stairs and running through life. He loved fight even with some of the best and strongest and he preferred these strong bad people to the timid good men who sat on the sidelines like J.P. Morgan. In political fights he fought tooth and claw. He never wanted to cower away from a fight. Never had Bordem didn’t know how to deal with it. His wife and mom died on the same day. Saw that life could be short unless you fight his wife died at 22. He said the light went out for his life he’s completely lost. He goes out west for a life of solitude on the frontier having basically given up on his life and himself. He goes through this horrible time and he’s stricken with sadness he goes to the badlands to punish himself really ([Time 0:31:48](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0a1e5e87-f025-4f98-9406-006a0fda2d1b))

    - **Note:** Teddy was always learning and had a high intellectual motor reading everything and enjoyed a great fight vs a worthy opponent hated bordum and would seek out fights. He had no time to waste and ran through life he would fight tooth and nail never cowering away, but life is short people he loved died and to deal with the sadness he basically put himself out to pasture on the badlands to die and instead he was reborn. Hardship innate in life
- Teddy was deeply depressed had nothing to live for. He convinced himself he wasn’t afraid by acting unafraid. Badlands were really bad you had to hate yourself to want to be there. Enjoyed the traits of a cowboy courage endurance and where meaness and cowardice weren’t tolerated. High regard for truthfulness and one’s word. Self reliant and confident. He comes back from this trip not the broken man he was but strong self confidence belief he could be president. He was a brave a cheerful man who never talked about his wife’s death hid it forever. He accomplished so much this time on the mountains badlands is when he became himself he walked into hell broken and rose like a phoenix at 27. He was very sad but hid it well. Alive at all points gifted with the faculty of living entirely and intensely in the moment. ([Time 0:31:48](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f58f7f9e-2e2f-4059-a803-b6247c3581bd))

    - **Note:** Teddys mom and wife die on the same day or very close he’s literally broken with nothing to live for a this Harvard educated well to do guy goes to the badlands to punish himself. Kinda goes here to die but learns the western values of honor courage and hard work and instills the confidence he needs and self belief to become president.
