  We don't put our emphasis on the journey part. We put our emphasis on the destination part. And we assume that the destination is going to come with a lot of happiness. This is a bias that researchers have called the arrival fallacy. I'll be happy when, you know, it's almost like the happily ever after. I'll be happily ever after if I get that promotion or happily ever after when I meet that person. And what we know from hedonic adaptation is that thing that's awesome in the moment when you arrive there quickly becomes the other thing. You mentioned briefly the gold medalists who have this moment where it's like they won the gold medal and that's awesome. But now everything else is downhill or I just got to do it again, right? We arrive at the best possible place we could have fantasized and instantly it's like, I just have to start chasing the next carrot. So sometimes when we find ourselves, I think as Americans, you know, chasing after the thing, I think it's important to remember that first of all, that chase is going to involve lots Of ups and downs. It's not going to be a linear path. It's probably not going to be overnight. Even the ones you mentioned, maybe with the exception of a really extreme case, required some kind of work and ups and downs and these kinds of things, right? We don't see those. But more, the happiness that we're going to get, it's better off if we're going not for the end result, that arrival and falling prey to the arrival fallacy. It's better if we can see some happiness in the journey. This has often been called this idea of sort of finding a journey mindset, which is sort of what can you take from the process of getting there, right? So you want to run your 5K, but like what can you do to try to enjoy the process of, you know, those runs that go along the way and noticing the kind of ups and downs and sort of paying attention To the journey. It's one way to kind of break out of falling prey to this arrival fallacy.
  Andrew Huberman
  Requires a serious frame shift. Totally.
  Laurie Santos
  And I think one that, you know, is not culturally accepted in the US. And I think this causes a lot of, you know, it causes a happiness hit, not just because like, sometimes we don't get there. Sometimes there's reason, you know, if you set your height super high, you know, you want to be Roger Bannister or whatever, like not all of us are going to get there, that's a four-minute Mile or success at work or $50 million or whatever it is. So sometimes if you set your sights too high, you just don't get there. And so that's a happiness hit. But a bigger – and sometimes when you do get there, it's a happiness hit because you get there and there's a happiness for a moment. But then, you know, that hit doesn't keep coming. I think we also just lose out on something when we're not in that journey mindset, because there's a lot of cool stuff along the way if we can kind of pay attention. But yeah, I think it's a big cultural shift from the way Americans usually think, but it's one that if we can achieve that, we'll start feeling a lot better. And it means even the failures in life are kind of good, because you are enjoying yourself along the way. For my podcast, I did an episode about these sort of Olympic medals where I talked about that, you know, the bronze lining effect and things. And I had Michelle Kwan, who, you know, Olympic medalist, we all remember her, but mostly just won silver. And I talked to her about, you know, what that felt like. And she said, it didn't matter to me. The things I loved about being Olympics wasn't the medal stand. It was when she first, she talked about putting her skates on and seeing the rings in the ice and recognizing as soon as I tie these laces, I'm going to get to skate over those. And I fantasize that's the journey mindset, right? You're not looking at the thing at the end, you're paying enough attention to the stuff along the way, even some of the stuff that's a pain in the butt that you kind of get some joy on the Ride.
  Andrew Huberman
  I certainly have learned to relish in the failures as well as the successes. And I think some of that also just comes with age. I've always wanted to say that. It's true though. It kind of comes with age.
  Laurie Santos
  You're old enough now, Andrew. You can jump into it.
  Andrew Huberman
  Yeah. You accrue enough experiences, good and bad and neutral. And you kind of go like, the other day I was in this kind of weird state of mind. I was like, wait, I've been here before. Like this shifts, like no worries. Like this shifts and then sure enough, it shifted. You know, like I think the first time we find ourself in a place or we find ourself back in a place and we forget we've been there before for whatever reason, or we try and pretend we haven't Been there before. It's like, and then you go through enough of those cycles, like, okay, this is part of a larger trajectory. It's an amazing thing about the brain I never understood, I still don't, which is that when we're feeling happy, we don't tend to think, gosh, this feeling is going to go away. Sometimes a little bit of that, but when we're feeling lousy, it does seem to do something to our sense of time, our time perception that makes it seem, especially in the real lows, in The real trenches, that it's going to go on forever. We can't imagine feeling differently. The this too shall pass is very hard to internalize when we're in those states. Totally.
  Laurie Santos
  But it can make you feel a lot. If you can get that distance from your current state, and this is a kind of, you know, you had Ethan Cross on the show. He talks a lot, a lot. If you can kind of get that distance of, well, how's this going to feel in five years? How's this going to feel in 10 years? You can sometimes feel a lot better. Interestingly, even when the happy stuff, if we can get some sense that like this isn't going to last forever, that can sometimes boost the happiness. Because we're kind of almost doing like a negative visualization in the forward direction, right? So a scarce experience, if you're having it, it's useful to remember like, you know, this is limited, right? This is temporary. I should enjoy this now while it's happening. The most extreme version of this, of course, is with our own lives, right? Contemplating our mortality. There's this idea of memento mori, which is a common phrase. I actually have my ring has memento mori on it, which is morbid, right? I'm going to die. I'm not going to be here. But when you recognize that, you know, the old school folks thought, and I think it's true, like you realize like, I can't take any of this stuff for granted. I have to pay attention now. This is not, you know, the kind of thing that's going to last forever. And so I think moments like that for positive experiences can feel like that. You know, if you're tasting a delicious glass of Pinot Noir sitting, yesterday I was, and you know, while I'm here, you know, took a walk on Santa Monica Beach and was like, you know, my Brain was like, oh, I have to, Andrew coming out. I was like, no, no, I'm going to like fly back to cold, you know, East Coast tomorrow. I need to pay attention, right? So thinking that this is finite can actually help you. There's a very funny study on this with college students where they did this sort of funny framing technique where they brought senior college students into lab, you know, kind of halfway Through, you know, the spring semester and told them, you know, you either have this many hours less of your time, which is a big number. You know, it makes it seem like thousands of hours. Or you have only this many days left before you graduate. Just like just a reminder. What they found was the one that got the days manipulation where it felt kind of short, they wound up doing more things, like kind of getting in those things that they t...

- **Three Timescales of Happiness**
  - Happiness exists on three timescales: immediate sensory pleasure, intermediate narrative/story-building, and long-term meaning/purpose. 
  - Engaging in activities aligned with personal values and strengths on shorter timescales can build toward long-term purpose.
  Transcript:
  Andrew Huberman
  Okay, every moment of it might not be as awesome as you might like, but there's meaning in spending time with people that are extended family, especially when elders and younger are In the same room. It layers on story to create this sort of other level that we call meaning. And so what I'm realizing is these are three timescales. Yeah. So we have the immediate timescale of happiness. We have the kind of intermediate one where we introduce a story and then we have meaning which is kind of like this whole picture yeah so it seems to me that we need to approach happiness From all three levels that it's not enough to just be like a dog yeah which are in the sensory experience presumably of of happiness if they tell stories they don't tell them to us. Yeah. And if they have meaning, I don't know. But they seem to like nail the first level. Yeah. So – and they're probably five more.
  Laurie Santos
  And they probably don't have the capacity to do the other two. So it's not like they're not doing it and kind of missing out. They kind of have brains that don't let them notice they're missing out. But we unfortunately have brains that would feel like we were really missing out if we just had the sensory experiences, you know, without the good stories. I think you're sort of pointing to this idea that sort of being happy in your life and being happy with your life. The with your life part has the kind of medium timescale stories. But also the really big ones, right? You know, is my life, am I doing anything really meaningful with my life? Am I finding purpose and so on? The funny thing, though, is to get to that big timescale to find a sense of purpose and stuff like that. Sometimes it pays to do stuff at the local level, at the medium and shorter term timescale. And one of the things researchers have found is that if you're engaging in activities at the short term timescales that kind of fit with your values or what these positive psychologists Have often called your strengths, that can be a way to sort of achieve purpose. So what are strengths? So researchers do this thing where they want to look at like all the valuable things people can do out in the world, right? And so what are the things that you value? And folks like Chris Peterson and colleagues have come up with this list of what they call different character strengths. And there are things that like, you know, you can actually, if you Google online character strengths, you'll get the big list. Often people talk about there being 24. But they're just universally good things like being brave, you know, citizenship, humor, like, you know, social intelligence, love of learning, right? You know, kind of empathy, fairness, right? These kind of sets of values that we have. People differ in how much they value ([Time 2:50:29](https://share.snipd.com/snip/764fe175-6f2c-4e79-8347-8e73f7fac18f))
- **Boosting Happiness through Purpose and Helping Others**
  - Infuse purpose into your work by identifying your strengths and finding ways to use them in your job.
  - Increase happiness by focusing on others, such as volunteering, donating, or asking for help.

  It's not my paycheck. And I guess he had a standard joke, which was like, oh, my God, let's play a big pile of vomit overtime for me. And you're laughing. Listener's probably laughing. He's like, that's my job. I talked to another worker who worked in a coma ward. So this individual couldn't talk to the patients because they're in comas. But her strength was creativity. And so every day she moved the artwork and the plants know, just kind of created some changes. And she thought maybe that would pop people out of their coma. I don't know if that's medically plausible, probably not, but it doesn't matter. To her, she felt like she was executing her creativity. And so the moral of this job crafting work is no matter what your job is, there's probably some room to building some more purpose. If you take some time to think about like, what are the strengths? What are the things that get you going? If you need a tip, you can kind of Google these things. But then how could I infuse that into my normal job description? And there's probably a lot more flexibility than you think. You don't need to quit your job and become a podcaster to like get this flexibility. Probably whatever you do, there's some window where you can build that in. That's awesome.
  Andrew Huberman
  Those are awesome stories. I also was just thinking about the janitor cleaning up the vomit, like to like, like restore some dignity to these people that clearly know they're making a mess and like, you know, humor Being the ultimate bridge and, and darn it, why'd you make me have to choose between humor and the other thing? But because humor your humor is pretty good. It's very brave to clean up vomit as well, I think, right? Yeah, and to bring humor to a place where some people might presume humor is not allowed. Goodness. The signature strengths and the list of, you said, 24 of them. Where can people learn more about these signature strengths? I think this would be a really powerful exercise. And we can always find the link and put it in the show note captions.
  Laurie Santos
  But is there like a place that people can find this stuff? The values in action is viacharacterstrengths.org. So I can share the link and you can stick it in your show notes. But yeah, people can go on there for free and do one of these kind of, you know, formal psychometric tests where you measure your strengths, see what they are. And it's a fun website too, because you get to kind of, they give you some suggestions. Because some of these, you know, values are like prudence is one of them. It's like, how do I exercise prudence? And they'll have, you know, these are different things. They also make the suggestion, and this is a homework assignment I give in my happiness class, of suggesting you do this with a good friend or a romantic partner. Have each of you do this and find strengths that you share together. And then you can go on what researchers call a strength state, where, you know, if you both have bravery, then that means you guys should do the, I don't know, the obstacle course or do Some really scary hike. If you both have humor, now you go to a comedy show. If you both love learning, now you go to a museum or something. So you find the thing that's like your convergent strengths and you do something that exercises them. So that means you can use your strengths to get purpose, not just in your work, but in your leisure too. And I think this is another spot where we get stuff wrong. I think a lot of us have work that tends to use our strengths. We tend to gravitate towards careers, many of us, where we can use our strengths. A lot of folks aren't that lucky. But in our leisure time, we don't often do that so much, right? Often our leisure time is like plop down, you know, watch Netflix for a lot of folks. Like, if you think about how you can build your strengths into your leisure time, it gets even more exciting. So, you know, you're talking about working with your hands and doing all this stuff like, you know, build the bravery and the humor into that somehow. And now you get your leisure time doing double duty for giving you a sense of purpose and meaning too.
  Andrew Huberman
  I love doing stuff with my hands and I also love doing things that are useful to other people. And years ago I used to go set up fish tanks for people at their homes. And I don't know why, but I just kept setting up all these fish tanks for all these people. I'm delighted in it. And it makes me realize that I think for everybody, certainly not just me, that we get tremendous pleasure from being useful to others in ways that really resonate with kind of who we Feel we are and these strengths. I think that's kind of the ultimate situation, really. And if we're getting paid for it, also great. But you're saying work it into your recreational time as well.
  Laurie Santos
  Yeah. And I'm glad you brought up this idea of doing for others because we haven't talked about that. But this is another behavioral hack that's huge for happiness. And I think one that we get wrong as a culture in the U.S., but kind of broadly. There's all this talk about self-care or treat yourself. If you look at any kind of article about happiness, maybe not so evidence-based, talking about self, self, self, self. If you look at happy people, though, happy people don't spend a lot of time on themselves. They tend to be very other-oriented. So controlled for income, happier people donate more money to charity than not-so people. Controlled for about a free time people have, happy people tend to volunteer for others, broadly construed, whether it's, you know, helping formally or kind of donating time, like They tend to help more than not-so people. That again, correlation, it could be happy, doing nice stuff for others helps you become happy. It could be that if you're happy, you do nice stuff for others. And for sure, that link is true. There is this thing called the feel good, do good effect. But lots of experiments have sort of forced people to do nice stuff for others and found that it winds up making them happier. Hand them 20 bucks. It's an awesome study to be in if you're some undergrad walking around campus like, oh, cool, 20 bucks. But then you'll be told how to spend it. You either have to spend the 20 bucks to treat yourself, do something nice for yourself, or spend the 20 bucks on someone else, do something nice for other people. And people at the end of the day, even kind of at later timescales, report being happier when they spend the exact same amount of money on someone else versus themselves. And I think this has a big message because sometimes, I don't know if you're like you, but if you're having a bad day, it's like, I'm going to treat myself for something. I might buy something or spend some money on myself, buy myself a kind of cool experience. But if you gifted that experience to your brother or your good friend, your coworker, your spouse, it might actually make you happier than having that experience yourself, which is Really counterintuitive, but it's what the data show.
  Andrew Huberman
  I've discovered this in recent years. I love, love, love giving gifts. It just, it's the best feeling. It's the best feeling.
  Laurie Santos
  Here's another hack you can do to help, to kind of help others oddly is to ask for help, which is something we forget is quite powerful. Think about the last time somebody asked you for advice, advice that you could give. Probably felt pretty good. It probably made you feel a little competent and whatever. Probably liked helping that person. You get the happiness boost from helping that person. We forget that asking other people for help, especially when we know they can kind of do it, can be a way to sort of give them a little gift and make them happy. This is one that can be hard for me because I like to think about my co... ([Time 2:55:52](https://share.snipd.com/snip/455d8b5d-43a8-4803-8197-f0ceb9d3cdc0))
