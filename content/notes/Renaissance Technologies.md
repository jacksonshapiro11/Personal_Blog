- Value Transfer Mechanism and Incentive Structure at Rentek
  Summary:
  Rentek employs a unique value transfer mechanism where employees gradually shift from being paid a carry amount to becoming a meaningful investor in the firm, ultimately transitioning to being only an LP.
  This structure facilitates a transfer of ownership from the old guard to the new guard in a clear and tax-advantaged way. The firm operates on a model of collaboration with a small team where financial impact is shared among all members.
  This approach, combined with a high carry performance fee LP GP model, ensures the right incentives for both new and old talent within the organization.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And they're deciding to bonus out the current team every year and just give them enough money to make sure you retain them.
  Speaker 2
  Right. Which is how I think most prop shops work. Like Jane Street is mostly a prop shop. I think it is mostly the principal's money. But that's a static situation. It's not like, you know, if that were true, then Jim would just own this thing forever. And I don't think that's true here at Rentek.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah. So essentially, David, the real magic is they've got one fund. It's evergreen. And when you start at the firm, you're only getting sort of paid the carry amount. But over time, you become a meaningful investor in the firm and you sort of shift to that 51% you're kind of the LP. And then over time, you eventually graduate out entirely and you're only an LP. And so you're right. It's a value transfer mechanism from the old guard to the new guard in a way that is clear, well understood, probably tax advantaged versus just doing, I'm the owner and I'm given every One arbitrary bonuses.
  Speaker 2
  Yeah. And at the end of the day, I think these three pieces to me are the core of this sort of tapestry of Rentek. One model that everybody collaborates on together, a super small team where we all know each other and the financial impact that any of us make to that one model is great to all of us. And three, this LP GP model with very high carry performance fees that creates the right set of incentives, both for new talent on the way in and old talent on the way out.
  Speaker 1
  Yep. I think that's right. Okay. There's a few other parts of the story that we skipped along the way because there was no real good place to put them in. But these are objectively fascinating historical events that are totally worth knowing about. And the first one is called basket options. So the year is 2002, Rentek has 13 years of knowing that they basically have a machine that prints money. So what should you do when you have a machine that prints money leverage? Now, there are all sorts of restrictions around firms like this and how much leverage they can take on. You can't just go and say, I'm going to borrow, you know, $100 for every dollar of equity capital that I have in here.

    - **Note:** One large model everyone works on together hire the smartest people have them constantly collaborate and create a great incentive structure that keeps people there full teamwork with a small smart team there no incentive not to collaborate it just makes everyone stronger. 78% gross returns fees act as a way to redistribute carry to keep everyone incentivized so the workers who come in get a ton of money year 1.
      critical mass of smart people, good incentives, one source of truth. Great communication/ coordination
- Unlocking Secrets in Complex Adaptive Systems
  Summary:
  Complex adaptive systems operate in a way where understanding the direct cause and effect relationships becomes challenging due to the high complexity and combinatorial nature of the system.
  In such systems, entities have intricate relationships that are not always visible on the surface. Renaissance Technologies (RENTec) has managed to navigate through this complexity by utilizing sophisticated models that have a slight edge in predicting outcomes in the market.
  While the models may lack a complete understanding of the market dynamics, their ability to make profitable predictions based on relationships between entities sets them apart.
  RENTec's approach involves deriving investment ideas directly from data and signal processing rather than through human intuition, enabling them to trade on profitable relationships that may not be apparent to others.
  By identifying and capitalizing on non-intuitive relationships between multiple factors, RENTec has been able to maintain a competitive edge in the market, unlike most other quant firms that rely on human interpretation to guide trades. This data-driven strategy allows RENTec to exploit hidden connections between seemingly unrelated entities, leading to profitable trading strategies even when the reasons behind these relationships are not fully understood.

  Speaker 1
  It's so funny. It's a whole bunch of people who are in the investment business, none of which are investors. Yes. Another one that you can decide if this fits or not, I was thinking a lot about complex adaptive systems. It's always been on my mind since we have the NZS Capital guys on a few years ago and read their work and the SINFA Institute's work on this. In a complex adaptive system, it's really difficult to actually understand how one thing affects everything else because the idea is the relationships are so combinatorially complex That you can't deterministically nail down this one thing is the cause of that other thing. It's the butterfly flapping its wings. But there are relationships between entities that you can't understand or see on the surface. Do you remember way back when we did our second Nvidia episode? I opened with the idea that when I was a kid, I always used to look at fire and think like, if you actually knew the composition of the atoms in the wood and you actually knew the way the wind Was blowing and you actually knew that all the... Could you actually model the fire? And when I was a kid, and you always just assume no, but actually the answer is yes. This is a known thing of what will happen when you light this log on fire for the next three hours and can you see exactly the flames? I think RENTEC has basically... They haven't figured that out for the market. They can't predict the future, but if they have a 50.01% chance of being correct, then they can sort of take a complex adaptive system and say, we don't really care that as a complex adaptive System. Our models understand enough about the relationships between all these entities that we're just going to run the simulation a bunch of times and we're going to be profitable enough From all the little pennies that we're collecting on all the little coin flips where we have a slight edge over and over and over and over again that they're sort of the closest in the world To being able to actually predict how the complex adaptive system of the market will work. Now, I don't think they can back out to it. No person could explain it, but I think their computers can.
  Speaker 2
  Yes, and I think when I've heard people from RENTEC talk about this, they will all say, the model does not actually understand the market, but it can predict and we can be so confident In its predictions about what the market will do that we rely on it, whether it understands or doesn't understand, doesn't actually matter. It can't tell you why, but that's okay.
  Speaker 1
  But it does know it has a slight edge, and so it should trade on it even though it can't explain why. Yes. Well, speaking of models, I've been trying to nail down an answer to this question. Do you think RENTEC was the birthplace of machine learning?
  Speaker 2
  This is such a tough answer to tell. We actually emailed some friends who are very prominent AI researchers and AI historians and sort of asked this question and the answer we got back is unsurprising. They said, we don't know because they don't share anything. Right.
  Speaker 1
  It's like the principle certainly came out of the same math community that spawned machine learning, but is what RENTEC has figured out over the last couple decades in Google's Gemini Model and in Chachib—no, it's not because they don't contribute any research back. It may be the case that actually RENTEC has beat everyone else to the punch, and they have a strong AI or something that is actually much more sophisticated than all the AI we have out in The world today, and they've just chosen that they'd rather keep it locked up and captive and make a bunch of money. I mean, it could just be the case that RENTEC is just taking in as much unstructured data as it possibly can, and they were just a decade or two ahead of everyone else and realizing that You can have unstructured, unlabeled data, and if you have enough of it, you can make it, in the case of an LLM, say things that sound right or sound true, or in the case of these trades, Be right more than 50% of the time. Right.
  Speaker 2
  Make trades that sound right.
  Speaker 1
  Right. They figured out this big unsupervised learning thing before anybody else all the way up until last year when the AI moment happened.
  Speaker 2
  If that were the case, we should have a very different answer to powers.
  Speaker 1
  To illustrate this point, it's quite interesting. Peter Brown's academic advisor was Jeffrey Hinton.
  Speaker 2
  Yes. Oh, I'm so glad we brought this up. Yeah. It was the exact same stew and the exact same cohort of people and social group and academic groups that RENTEC came out of, that AI came out of.
  Speaker 1
  The other person, just for people who are like, why are you saying that? To make it super explicit, the other person whose academic advisor was Jeffrey Hinton is Ilya Sotskiever, who is the co-founder of OpenAI. I mean, many years later, but still. Yeah.
  Speaker 2
  I mean, it's like we were talking about with Markov models and hidden Markov models. That is the foundation of RENTEC. That is one of the foundations of AI and generative AI today.
  Speaker 1
  Okay. Another big one is this concept that you should trade on a secret that others are not trading on. So on the face of it, it seems obvious. Of course, I should come up with some strategy to trade on that other people aren't trading on. But I said a couple of words there, which is, of course, I should come up with and therein lies the fallacy. I think most investment firms try to get their ideas out of people and then do an incredibly rigorous amount of data analysis to figure out if they should put those trades on or not. I could be wrong, but I do not think modern RENTEC does that. I think all of their investment ideas come from data and come from signal processing. And so therefore, you are going to put trades on that make no intuitive sense. And so when you're putting trades on that are profitable and make no intuitive sense, you aren't going to have competitors. If you find a relationship between two things that a human could never come up with or dream of those relationships, and we're saying two, it end things, 10 things, 20 things, 100 things, And in various different weights at various different timescales, that is a killer recipe to exploit a secret that no one else knows and be able to beat other people in the market.
  Speaker 2
  Such a good point. And many, if not most of the other quant firms are not doing that, some of them may be, but I think most of them are the model is suggesting things, and there is a person or persons who are The master portfolio allocators that pull the trigger or don't pull the trigger. Yes.
  Speaker 1
  And to be super illustrative, because I think their n... ([Time 2:34:45](https://share.snipd.com/snip/84ae3d98-d671-459a-998b-307efce73945))

Complex systems. Build and trust complex systems.

- The Two by Two Matrix of Trade Execution Strategies
  Summary:
  Trade execution strategies in the quant trading industry can be categorized into a two by two matrix based on speed and trade intelligence.
  High frequency traders focus on fast and obvious trades by leveraging the fastest connectivity for front running trades. On the other hand, firms like Medallion operate in the slow and smart quadrant, using machine learning to discover non-obvious trades that are executed more slowly to capitalize on their strategic advantage.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Okay, my next one is brought to you by a friend of the show, Brett Harrison, who has worked in the quant trading industry for a long time and shared an idea that he has with us, which is that There's basically this two by two matrix. You have on the one axis fast and slow in terms of trade execution. And on the y-axis, you have smart versus obvious.
  Speaker 2
  Yeah, the way he phrased it to us was smart versus dumb, but dumb doesn't mean dumb.
  Speaker 1
  Right, it's the obvious trades. And the high level point is all quant funds are not high frequency trading firms and vice versa. And this is something that I didn't know not coming from this industry and now makes total sense to me. I think I thought they were the same thing, but fast and obvious is your classic high frequency trader. They're front running trades. They're locating in a data center that's really near the, this is flash boys, or they've got a microwave line between New Jersey and Chicago, and they're trying to arb the difference Between two markets. You need to have the fastest connectivity in the world to pull this off. Yeah, this is Jane Street. Yes, there's fast and smart, which you kind of don't need to be both. You don't need the fastest connectivity in the world and the most clever trades to put on. So people kind of tend to pick a lane that they're either a high frequency trader, or they're trying to make the smartest, most non-obvious trades possible. And that, of course, leads us to medallion, which is in the slow and smart quadrant. All the machine learning system discovered the relationships and the data. So there's a huge amount of compute. The non-obvious trades. Exactly. That goes into finding the non-obvious trades, but then they're actually made reasonably slowly. They still have to happen within seconds or minutes, but the advantage isn't that they're high frequency, the way that all the flash boys stuff is.
  Speaker 2
  My sense is, Rintech is not a high frequency trading shop. They're not front running things. They're not flash boys. Compared to you and me, they still operate incredibly fast, but it's more about the smartness and less about the fastness.
  Speaker 1
  Greg has a quote in his book, they hold thousands of long and short positions at any given time, and their holding period ranges from one to two days or one to two weeks. They make between 150,000 and 300,000 trades a day, but much of that activity entailed buying or selling in small chunks to avoid impacting market prices rather than profiting by stepping ([Time 2:42:24](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9e91274c-8791-4326-8df7-9e8980136e63))
