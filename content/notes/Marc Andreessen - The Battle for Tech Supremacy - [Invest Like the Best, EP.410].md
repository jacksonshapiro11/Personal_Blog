### Highlights

- **Technological Change and its Limiting Factors**
  - Technological change is visualized as lines on a graph representing pace of change, sociological acceptance, financial feasibility, and now, political influence.
  - The art of entrepreneurship and tech investing lies in aligning these curves, backing technologies that are ready technically, socially acceptable, and financially viable.
  - Governmental and political factors have emerged as significant hurdles, particularly in areas like crypto, fintech, social media, and AI.
  - Political scrutiny and attempts to control and suppress new technologies are the biggest obstacles for entrepreneurs and investors in recent years.
  - This governmental opposition can be a key factor influencing an individual's shift from an elite to a counter-elite perspective.

  I'm a case study of it myself. If we take an optimistic lens, your emphasis on early stage venture, you get to meet all these young, brilliant people that are about to go build the future. Let's take the optimistic lens and say, AI has the most positive impact that we can imagine and all the places where we can verify the outcomes, reasoning becomes so powerful. What are the other related choke points that get in the way of the sort of explosive technology revolutions that we all want? That could be clinical trials in medicine or something that just going to go slower than AI is going to go. And AI is not going to be the problem. We're going to have bursting at the seams of wanting to make progress, but the world of atoms or the world of regulation or the world of clinical trials or whatever it might be are going To become the rate limiters, not intelligence and knowledge. Which of those choke points have you most personally interested today?
  Marc Andreessen
  The way I've always thought about technological change is a set of lines on a graph. It used to be three lines, now it's four lines. So one is the pace of technological change. That's a line where everything generally gets better and better and better. And then every once in a while, you have these discontinuous step functions up or something gets dramatically better, like what happened last week with AI. Then you've got another line on top of that, which is sociological change, which basically is when is the world ready for the new thing? And sometimes you get this phenomenon where the new thing actually exists before the world's ready for it. And for some reason, it doesn't take and then five years later, 50 years later, it actually takes and often away it goes. So there's a sociological layer. And then on top of that, there's the financial layer, which is are the capital markets willing to fund it? And can it generate a return? The way I think about it is the technology line is kind of a squiggle like this up to the right. The social line is this big sweeping curve as large numbers of people reevaluate what they want. And then the financial line is like an EKG of a heart attack where the market's going through its patterns of panic and euphoria. The art of being an entrepreneur or a tech investor is to try to slice across all three of those. You're trying to back something where the technology is really ready, society is ready to adopt it, and you can actually get the thing funded or get the thing exited and taken public. And so you got to kind of line that up. A lot of what we do in the day job is line up those three curves. The fourth one now in the last five years is politics. And as I said earlier, for a very long time, people in Washington just had an attitude of benign neglect towards the tech industry. And they're like, yeah, their kid's building fun toys, whatever. It's fine. It doesn't matter. And now there's just, as you know, just like intense political scrutiny on almost every aspect of the tech industry and like incredible attempts to control and suppress new technologies. The harshest version of that is in places like the EU, but we've had our own versions of that here. And so all of a sudden we have this fourth factor now. In the last four years, overwhelmingly, the answer to your question is politics. In the last four years, overwhelmingly, the biggest issue that we had was government. That was very bizarre and disconcerting to me when it first started because I wasn't used to it. And I had never viewed us as being involved in politics or being partisan or really. We were not in Washington trying to curry favor. We were not trying to get subsidies, but we also didn't think we had to do anything to avoid getting stepped on. And then that just radically changed. That's the single biggest thing. You're probably well aware at this point, or your listeners are well aware, the policy implications on crypto were just devastating for the last five years. FinTech also extremely damaging. Social media got tremendously stomped on by the state, which led to all the censorship stuff. And then AI. I've spoken to other places about what they were basically going to do to AI. For the last four years, I've just been in this bizarre situation where it's like my main enemy is my own government, which is very, very strange. And by the way, talk about accelerating my evolution from an elite into a counter elite. It's like, okay, if they hate me and want to destroy me, it makes the call relatively easy for what I need to do. ([TimeÂ 1:01:43](https://share.snipd.com/snip/cc739ec5-1bb3-4075-bdc8-29e5ae0d2a1e))
