### Highlights

- Successful Founders Manage Their Own Psychology. For years I’ve been saying that more than half of being a successful founder is managing your own psychology. I came to this realization after seeing my wife, Dr. Sherry Walling, help founders find success after months or years of failure due to mental blocks and other unhelpful patterns.

    - **Note:** successful founders have a bias towards action build a founder gut and effectively manage their psychology. Bias to action manage your mind.
- How do you know what to work on? Some founders are good at seeing this from the start—most of us are not. You can get better at it by:
  • Being around successful founders, seeing what they work on and how they think about things
  • Learning through your own experimentation, trial and error
  • Exploring mental frameworks like my Stair Step Method of Entrepreneurship, Sean Ellis’s Three Stages of the Startup Pyramid, and my Risk vs. Certainty framework I’ll outline next ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvfg0cdd9kwa60sbwrfa91ce))
    - **Note:** much of a start up is doing things that don't scale so you need to focus your time on the highest leverage activities not doing the most things possible
- Raising $100,000 to $500,000 after you have a modicum of initial traction won’t solve all your problems, but it can certainly make things less stressful and can buy you the resource no founder ever has enough of: time.
  In your personal life, money saves you hours. 
  In your business, money saves you years.
  If you’re working nights and weekends, raising enough to fund a year or two of your salary can be a game-changer for your company. Being able to quit your day job and focus full-time makes a night-and-day difference in achieving escape velocity.
  If you’re already full-time, raising funding to hire someone who can take tasks off your plate can be equally powerful. It’s incredible the boost you can give your business when you’re no longer stuck in the code or the support treadmill.
  Funding can be a powerful tool—but you need to know what you’re getting into.
  Have a Plan
  What will you do with the money? How are you going to deploy it to grow the company?
  It is tough to find an investor who will give you money if you don’t have a plan, and it can be dangerous for your business. If you don’t know what you’re doing, money will not fix that. You’re just going to make bigger mistakes, faster.
  I generally don’t recommend raising funding before you have some semblance of product-market fit because (A) your valuation is lower at this stage, and (B) you’re likely to burn through most of that money just trying to find product-market fit.
  Don’t Torch Your Cap Table
  Your capitalization table is a list of who owns what percentage of your company. Literally: Rodrigo owns 70%, Janine owns 20%, and Fred owns 10%. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvfg954m5amd3qrq0efzj5hw))
    - **Note:** Money saves you time but don't raise money and complicate/ fuck your cap table
- Unnecessary Stress
  Roadblocks put stress on your mind, on your body, and on your relationships. It’s no way to live, especially for folks who are building startups to improve our lives.
  We don’t have to grow at all costs or answer to a board. We build startups with the handicap of not being able to raise buckets of funding. Not receiving funding means hard-earned freedom, and you shouldn’t squander it by letting your mind manufacture roadblocks where there are none.
  At some point a couple years ago, I realized that all the stress and worry over my then 14 years building companies was not a good thing. When people ask what my biggest regret has been as a founder, it’s that I stressed too much about things that were going to work out. I made roadblocks out of speed bumps.

    - **Note:** most things that seem like roadblocks are speed bumps don't cause unnecessary stress and comflate the two business is problems and problems are soluable not landing a customer doesn't end your business there are many fish in the sea. Don't do something if you're going to make yourself miserable it's not the point of life. First do something where you can enjoy the ride then enjoy it.
- Optionality
  My process for solving problems has moved from stressing about everything that could go wrong to mapping out three or four possible options if things do go wrong. Often these options are not optimal, but none of them would be business-ending.
  Typically they involve spending more money, investing more time, turning down a lucrative deal, or navigating a sticky situation. These are all things I’d prefer not to do, but none would ruin the company.
  Making the mental shift from “everything will end” to “we’ll switch to plan B, C, or D” has been one of the biggest leaps in my own psychology. I’ve realized this over the past few years, but I heard it in full force in the podcast episode I mentioned at the start of this section.
  I would not be overstating to say this has been a life-changing realization. My regret is that I didn’t discover it years ago. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvfgf5373ay4qmdssch1prvk))

    - **Note:** Make sure you know contingencies and maintain optionality thats vital. Your world when it feels like it’s ending is never ending plot to contingencies so you have a plan when shit hits the fan which always well. The world is never ending problems are just opportunities in work clothes
- How to Choose a Mentor
  Perhaps a mentor is creating content that resonates with your goals, or they’ve built a company you admire. Here are a few questions to consider when choosing a mentor:
  • Have they accomplished what I want to accomplish? Does it seem like they got lucky, or could they do it again?
  • Does this person have a reasonable personal life? Do they treat people well? Do they have a happy family? If someone has a catastrophic personal life, odds are decent that if you’re not willing to do the same, you’ll be unlikely to achieve success in the same way they did.
  • Do you want to be like them, and are you willing to do what they’ve done to become successful?
  Who you choose as a mentor is a deeply personal choice, but it’s usually pretty obvious who resonates with you both as a founder and as a human. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvfgjkspj04hd7h1kv7fzkyj))

    - **Note:** How to choose a mentor also find a peer group that gives you support community and holds you accountable these are vital when you're building
- The sweet spot for your work should be where all three intersect. If you’re focusing solely on things you’re good at that bring you joy, you can get stuck galloping down paths that are detrimental to the needs of your company. If you’re doing things the company needs that bring you joy (but you’re not good at), then you’re dragging your company down.
  But if you’re stuck doing things the company needs that you’re good at (but don’t like), that leads to burnout.
  That’s exactly what I was doing. I hired an executive assistant who lightened that load for a bit. She helped streamline a few things and made appointments, but what I really needed was someone to whom I could delegate at another level.
  At the time, I felt like we couldn’t afford someone who wasn’t contributing to the bottom line of the company. In retrospect, this was one of the biggest mistakes I made while building the company.
  I should have hired someone who could come into the office and handle operations. Things like legal, payroll, HR, and facilities. Most of these were outsourced to external providers, and it was just a matter of interfacing with them.
  As I look back at my descent into burnout, one thing that could have saved me was having enough funding to hire someone to do the work that didn’t bring me joy. Or prioritizing spending money on hiring and delegating tasks that didn’t move the business forward but were contributing to my lack of satisfaction at work.

    - **Note:** Do the work you love and outsource what you don't when you can to avoid burnout
- Getting through Burnout
  I’ve heard burnout manifests itself differently in different people, but for me it felt like a mix of depression and frustration. Not the kind you can clear up with a weekend away, but a long-term, deep sense of tiredness, lack of motivation, and feeling just a little pissed off at all times.
  This led to my aforementioned stints of staring at Trello for hours and a lack of presence at home. I would be home with the family, but most of the time my mind was elsewhere.
  I tell this as a cautionary tale: if you find yourself listless, unmotivated, or constantly frustrated as you endure the stress of building your company, it’s unlikely to fix itself. The best remedy for burnout is significantly changing your habits and patterns related to work, including stepping away for weeks, which feels like the last thing you can do when everything is going crazy (whether it’s good crazy or bad crazy).
  If you find yourself in this situation, you need to address it, or it will get worse. If unaddressed, burnout can lead to terrible outcomes, including long-term damage to your brain.
  If burnout is a situation you find yourself in, consider reaching out to a professional who works with founders on the mental game of entrepreneurship. Dr. Sherry Walling is one (she happens to be my wife, and she knows her stuff), but there are many other executive coaches and therapists who work with high-performing individuals to manage stress, burnout, and everything else that comes with our line of work.
  I’ve only started to touch on burnout here, but for an entire chapter about it, check out my third book: The Entrepreneur’s Guide to Keeping Your Sh*t Together: How to Run Your Business Without Letting it Run You. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvfgsb9v6kn73xqfeqgb3xdd))

- Taking a Founder Retreat
  The two biggest things that have helped me in my journey as a founder are masterminds and founder retreats. Without those, I sincerely don’t think I would be as successful as I have been.
  My wife Sherry has a PhD in psychology. She started going on annual retreats after we had kids, where she got away for 48 or 72 hours without podcasts, movies, or books—just herself, a notebook, and silent reflection.
  When she first started taking retreats, it didn’t sound like my thing. I’m always listening to a podcast or an audiobook. I’m constantly working on the next project. But after seeing her come back from these retreats energized and focused, I decided to give it a try.
  I booked myself a hotel on the coast and drove out for the weekend with no radio, no project, no kids, and no distractions.
  Over the course of that two-and-a-half-hour drive, things began to settle. I started feeling everything I hadn’t had time to feel for the past year. In the silence, I had sudden realizations because I was finally giving them quiet time to emerge.
  During that retreat, it became obvious that my whole life had been about entrepreneurship. Ever since I was a kid, I have wanted to start a business. I’ve always been enamored with being an entrepreneur and the excitement of startups. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvfh17zvhzt3we1cst6xvah9))
    - **Note:** Take a retreat gives yourself space to clear the air and have a chance to explore what you really want and need. Step back to go forward.
