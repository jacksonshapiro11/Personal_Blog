### Highlights

- **Your** **first job is to know yourself.** You have to understand your temperament and your relationship to money. Wrong about your temperament? Watch the market flush you out. Never contemplated your *emotional* relationship to money? Careful, you might self sabotage.
  > A series of market decisions does add up, believe it or not, to a kind of personality portrait. It is, in one small way, a method of finding out who you are, but it can be very expensive. This is the first Irregular Rule: **If you don’t know who you are, this is an expensive place to find out.** — [Adam Smith (George Goodman),](https://alchemy.substack.com/p/investment-library-the-money-game) *[The Money Game](https://alchemy.substack.com/p/investment-library-the-money-game)*
  Knowing yourself deeply, and following your unique path, acts as protection against the herd instinct, envy, FOMO, and the deafening drumbeat of public opinion.
  The same goes for investigating your motivation.
  > Whatever you want to do in life, you don't solve for money, you don't solve for prestige or adulation or anything like that. —*[Todd Combs](https://alchemy.substack.com/p/weekend-journal-smoking-for-the-mind)*
  **The best investors are obsessed with playing the game.** They don’t do it *only* for the money. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hegxs2dg6s4x0jw14gq0eywm))
    - **Note:** You need to understand yourself and live a life true to yourself or else you will fail. unique differentiation is the only survival
- Michael Lewis once noted that the more Michael Burry studied Buffett, “the less he thought Buffett could be copied.”
  > Buffett, though he had every advantage in learning from Ben Graham, did not copy Ben Graham, but rather set out on his own path, and ran money his way, by his own rules. **To succeed in a spectacular fashion you had to be spectacularly unusual.** — *The Big Short*
  Get inspired by the previous generations, but don’t blindly copy.

  The sweet spot is to find a strategy that works, which suits your temperament, and which *interests* you because… ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hegx7775kncrjme115pz8wgr))
    - **Note:** you need to invest in what works for you
- **Good investing is mostly ‘boring’ working with brief moments of excitement.** I say ‘boring’ because the research process is boring to most people, but not to everyone. It is an endless loop of keeping up with the world and trying to understand things — a company, an industry, a trend, a technology, an event — by reading, crunching data, and talking to people. Every once in a while, things get exciting. Like when you find a great idea or when the market punches you in the face. And in exactly those moments, you have to resist and remain calm. It’s the inverse of how most people go through life: they run from the grind of mundane work and throw themselves into thrills.

    - **Note:** investing is a quiet and boring profession and you need to be passionate to get through those boring bits and find the gold. When you do you need to be calm. It’s all about being mild mannered.
- > I’ve always believed markets are smarter than I am. They send out a message and if I listen to them properly, no matter how powerful my thesis, if they’re screaming something else, it’s telling me you’ve got to re-evaluate. — *Stanley Druckenmiller*
  Is the market a servant or a source of valuable information? Both sides can be right in the context of their strategies. It’s important to be clear and explicit about the market’s role in your process.
  Which leads us to another seeming contradiction: **you can learn from any great investor, but often not what you expect.** All of them can teach you about human nature, about markets, about resilience, about mistakes, and about the lonely search for opportunity. Study what worked for others, even if you never intend to pursue their strategy. What did they figure out about the world? How would they think about your strategy? What can you learn from the contrast? Remember that all of them wrestled with the same market and the same inner game. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hegxfy1qhyy30z9jah78e0b5))
    - **Note:** There are many approaches to viewing a market and value in understanding everyones perspective but taking a path that is uniquely yours
- > Jeff Bezos to Buffett: “Your investment thesis is so simple. You’re the second richest guy in the world, and it’s so simple. Why doesn’t everyone just copy you?”
  > 
  > Warren Buffett: “Because nobody wants to get rich slowly.”
  **The market will punish you for being in a rush.** Well, technically you will punish yourself.
  I get it. You want to be rich and enjoy life while you’re still young. It’s just that the market *does not care* about what you want. It will occasionally offer amazing opportunities, what Soros called a ‘special day’, but it does so on its own schedule. Swinging for the fences when you need money is a sure way to lose your capital. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hegxp7kmzp36gdjqfvv5s5tn))

    - **Note:** Investing requires getting rich slowly and rarely are there special days but when there are you need to take advantage. Tail outcomes happen but being slightly above average is the clearest way to success. Investing is patience and slow compounding.
- **Finally, you don’t become a great investor by reading about other great investors.** Don’t let learning turn into procrastination. If you want to become a better investor, invest. Remember what Charlie Munger said about the young man asking advice from Mozart: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hegxnjx5ms1skzmz8ja6h90m))
