### Highlights

- Episode AI notes
  1. Asking the right questions to customers and using clever strategies can provide meaningful insights into pricing strategies, such as doubling the price until reaching a threshold or comparing the product's value to established benchmarks.
  2. Packaging products with a leader, fillers, and killers principle, like McDonald's Happy Meal, can help in determining product configuration and bundling.
  3. Failures in monetizing innovation include not pricing products at their true value and missing out on potential revenue, as well as hiding potential products that could cannibalize existing business.

- How to Productize to Segments
  Key takeaways:
  - The most critical step in the process is asking the right questions to get accurate pricing information.
  - Asking customers directly what to charge for a product will yield unhelpful responses.
  - Using clever strategies, such as doubling the price until reaching a threshold, can provide meaningful pricing insights.
  - Putting people in a relative mindset can lead to more intelligent and informed decisions about pricing.
  - Asking customers to compare the value of the product to another established product, such as Salesforce, can provide useful pricing guidance.
  - Using the acceptable, expensive, and prohibitively expensive framework can help determine the optimal pricing point.
  - Acceptable price tends to be the one that customers love both in terms of the product and its price.
  - The right price is usually the expensive price, representing the value customers are willing to pay.
  - Prohibitively expensive price is the point at which customers would reject the product due to its high price.
  - Analyzing psychological thresholds in the market can reveal insights about pricing.

  What are the kinds of questions that you recommend companies ask to make sure they're getting an accurate measure of some sort of price or willingness to pay or value or something.
  Speaker 1
  I think this is the most critical and important step in the whole process. And we've actually dedicated a whole chapter in the book monetizing innovation chapter four. It's called how to have the willingness to pay conversation. If you go and ask a customer, what should I charge for this product? You'll get garbage back. That's your job. That's not your customers job to solve your pricing strategy. But there's some clever ways of asking this in such a way that you get some meaningful responses. For instance, one of the easiest things that I remember a founder actually did to find out their pricing strategy is he kept doubling the price in every deal till someone laughed him Out of the room. Okay, he found that there was a threshold and he hit that. And then he knew that that's why he needs to stabilize. That's at the basic level. Right? I mean, just keep doubling till you hit the ceiling. That's one way to have that conversation. Some other ways to have that conversation is put people in a relative mindset. I mean, tongue and cheek, I say people are absolutely meaningless, but relatively super smart. What I mean by this is if you go and ask them on how much should I charge, you'd get garbage. But relatively speaking, people can make a very intelligent and informed decision. For instance, if I'm, let's say I'm making a software product, SaaS product, and I go and ask the prospect that I'm trying to sell to and I say, Hey, do you have Salesforce installed in Your install base and say, Yes, I do. Okay, if Salesforce was indexed at hundred in value, what do you think we bring to the table for your business? That's a question people can answer all day long, which is if they say it's 70 or 80, then that's how much you're off compared to like Salesforce. Similarly, if you say if Salesforce is indexed at hundred in price, where do you think we should be? That's also an answer that people can make more sense of. In fact, you can bring that back into your negotiation strategies when you're selling this product again saying, Hey, look, you're paying X for Salesforce. Typically, this is a value we are here and we can justify our price. And you can quickly justify the price that you're actually coming up with. So these are kind of relative questions. There are more in depth ways of asking. One of the probably most useful Monday morning ways of actually asking this is to ask what I call as the acceptable, expensive and prohibitively expensive question. What this means is think about this. You identified a problem and unmet need in the market. You came up with a solution to actually address this unmet need. You built a prototype wireframe product, whatever you want to call it blueprint. And then you pitch this to the customers, pitch the benefits, pitch the value and go to the same. Exercise you would go through after you launched the product, but before pitch the value and then ask them, what do you think is an acceptable price for this innovation. Now, we all know that people love to lowball themselves. They would negotiate and they would give you an answer. And then ask them, what do you think is an expensive price and then follow that with like, what do you think is a prohibitively expensive price. What we have seen across thousands of projects that we have done in this space acceptable tends to be the price that people not only love your product, but they also love your price. If you're in some really fast growth mode, you could keep it because it's a no brainer, no friction price, no one thinks about it. The right price usually tends to be around the expensive price. This is the value price. What people will pay you for the value you bring to the table, they would not necessarily be your best friends. They won't be enemies. It's a neutral reaction. It's like the value price prohibitively expensive tends to be the price that they would actually laugh you out of the room. And if you do this at scale, you can start seeing what are the psychological thresholds in the market. ([Time 0:16:30](https://share.snipd.com/snip/53b5cd0d-f5bb-48f3-b879-8351427cb0ea))

    - **Note:** Preach the benefits not the features. Price and value are intertwined. Things are a product if they work at $2 but do they at $200? Segments need values and willingness to pay. Different products for different segments. Find their willingness to pay but indexing the value you provide or just doubling your price until someone says no. Find cheap expensive and prohibitively expensive price for your product. What benefit does this product give and what will I pay for that?
- Leaders fillers and killers in bundles. Leaders are the draw in fillers are the sell on killers don’t fit and are better alone. Talk benefits vs features. Pricing subscription pay as you go dynamic pricing freemium and premium. Find the right model then build around it. What value are you providing is time time reduction doing something better. If you are saving money where is that coming from is it inventory reduction ect what service saves the money. You should be able to capture 20-25% of the value you create. Dont concern about margin first find willingness to pay for your value then come up with the right margin and cost structure for the business. Science and art to pricing have pricing commercial conversation early and often. What are you building and who for.
  Failure types too many features minivation undercharging not monetizing or productizing an innovation or just making a product no one wants. Price before product. CEO’s pricing product. ([Time 0:23:02](https://share.snipd.com/snip/007c2fc3-f0d4-4742-a6c2-4668cf620971))

    - **Note:** Pricing strategy is important you need to start with whatever pricing works then build your margin structure from there. You need to figure out the price people are unhappy but still pay and charge that and get to that through optimization. Price is what you pay value is what you are buying you should capture 20-25% of the value you create. find willingness to pay then price it. Common failure archetypes
      Price is what you pay value is what you get.
- Monetizing Innovation Failure Types
  Key takeaways:
  - The company priced their innovative product at 85 cents instead of charging more and still achieved significant economic value.
  - Consumer electronics companies were able to charge a $50 premium for products that contained the semiconductor chips.
  - The company missed out on potential revenue by not pricing their product higher.
  - Hidden gems are products that go against the company's DNA and are not productized due to concerns about cannibalizing existing business.

  So your cost to produce the goods is lesser, but they knew that they had come up with something truly innovative. So they said, let's undo Moore's law. And the previous generation was 65 cents. They said, let's price it at 85 cents. And the product flew out of the shelf. The secret in the room was that everyone knew that they could have charged Moore, for instance. They went and did a post-mortem two years after this product was launched. What they found out was these consumer electronics companies that ended up using these semiconductor chips could actually charge $50 of premium from people like you and I, simply Because this chip was inside. And when you look at 85 cents for $50 of economic value, that was completely unfair. And in fact, most of them left saying you could have gone all the way to $5 and would have been just fine. I mean, you multiply that with the millions and billions of these chips that were actually sold, how much money was left on the table that is staggering. That's a minivation where you had the absolutely right product market fit solving the need, but you just didn't have the courage to ask the right price. That's a minivation. The third monetizing innovation failure type is what we call as hidden gems. So these are products that kind of go against the grain of your company or your DNA. And you just don't want to productize this because you're worried about cannibalizing your existing business. So you just put it in a shelf and it's hidden.
