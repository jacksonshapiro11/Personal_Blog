### Highlights

- Interviewing a getting people who quit to stay are the 2 most important tasks in the org requires asking good questions getting the sense of what people want and ego they are. Good questions in here to refer to. Also valuable to keep people who tried to quit. Money can valuable task relevant feedback. The Peter principle people always get over promoted to their level of incompetence because people should continue to get challenged. This eventually leads to them failing which is ok but you need to demote them which is hard if not impossible. Having a better organization is worth mild discomfort. Create internal train course and iterate that over time. Training is your duty and try to improve your course. Teaching is hard and iterative. It’s not about learning but implementation. Measure present and future value and how much you are hurting the present in intensity or trade offs vs the future.

    - **Note:** Understand the present and future trade-offs of what you’re making. Peter principal of getting promoted above competence. Critical mass of smart people is vital for hiring and firing the team is your most important job. Second level conversations and deep understanding of others. Feedback loops and incentive structures
- Performance reviews are to improve performance of those who work for you and should both give praise things to work on and motivation for the future. Don’t be afraid to say unpleasant truths. You’re giving feedback no only on performance this year but how well they’ve set up for the future it’s a pv of future outcomes review. Having a good year at the expense of the future isn’t a great year. Good reviews are frank and require you to listen to make sure you’re getting your message clearly through. You can’t deliver too much information it’s gotta be enough for them to digest without overwhelming them. Write down all your feedback then go through it with how to deliver what you want. You need to get people to change even if they don’t want to and they don’t have to like your decision but they need to implement it. Sometimes you need to pull the boss card without their agreement. Make sure you give positive and negative feedback/ steps for improvement to everyone especially top performers

    - **Note:** Good feedback is vital and needs to be directed and balanced. You cannot sacrifice the future for the present (long vs short term incentives). Good reviews require as much listening and talking. They're honest and give the right amount of things to work on without overwhelming the person.
- 3 things that control our actions free market forces, contractual obligations, and cultural values. Culture is vital and getting the incentives right so people do the right thing in the right situation is vital weather it’s cultural or contractural agreements make sure they’re in place c. Sees motivation through mallows hierarchy of needs. We replace lower needs with higher needs. Self actualization is a continuous motivator someone can be achievement or competence driven ie focused on mastery. Constantly test and push yourself test the outer limits and stretch. You need to work at edge of limits. Everyone has different motivation. Task relevant feedback. Create sources of motivation that align with what motivates employees. Best management style is unclear relies on task relevant maturity. Management modes should be viewed as effective not effective. When the trm is low you need more structure in life from those in charge and overtime you give people more rope give strategic direction and less hands on. Guidance based on experience with specific tasks not other tasks.
    - **Tags:** #culture-(strong/intentional), #feedback-(give/get), #maturity, #self-actualization, #leadership, #maslows-hierarchy, #iteration
    - **Note:** Culture requires getting the incentives, right. We function by Maslow hierarchy needs. Management must give task relevant. feedback. People get more rope the more they have and learn and prove that they deserve. Self actualization as everyone’s goal and find out what motivates people.
- Strategy vs tactics strategy is steps to take tactics are high level plan. Planning is about knowing environmental demand knowing internal ability and working to bridge the gap with what you can do and what you can’t. Make choices about which new demand is worth meeeting. Plan today for tomorrow’s problems not firefighting. Planning is a managers goal. Create a clear plan with milestones it’s clear what you’re saying yes and no to. MBO system is more focused on results than method if you achieve your goal a different way you still win despite not doing it the way you thought. Clear goals flexible execution. Organizations are teams and made up of teams of teams. Balance centralization and decentralization functional and mission driven parts. One supports realizing economies of scale the other creates. Trade off of efficiency and self organization. Dual reporting having 2 different bosses can be very beneficial in balancing a business. You can run a church group and be on a planning committee with the same people and you have a different org structure in both places.

    - **Note:** Strategy vs tactics. Understand the system and choose how you want to meet demand build an intentional system and plan for the future. Clear goals flexible execution get the job done. An organization is an organization function doesn’t matter principles apply across. Strong feedback loops. Constraint optimization problems.
- Process oriented meeting sharing knowledge on regular basis or mission oriented to solve a problem these are ad hoc. Have one on ones depending on seniority have the subordinate set the agenda this is for them should last an hour. Meetings on a rolling basis take notes because they remind you what to do just writing down keeps you engaged even if you never review again. One on ones are valuable with family in life. You can then have group and organization meets to discuss amongst different sized groups for different problems or information dissemination. 8 people max at a meeting and these are work so you should be engaged. Have good outline and send out minute after. Make sure we are blending know how and experience when making a decision. They’re not always the same then have a clear and actionable attributable decision made after. Everyone needs to support the decision made at the lowest competent level. Blend knowledge and position power. Have meeting of peers with a senior person to provide an outside view. He shouldn’t drive the decision but be a wall to bounce this off of. A business decision isn’t life to death don’t be paralyzed just make it. If you can’t make a clear decision the person with the most at stake should make the decision. Don’t worry about sounding dumb. Make sure you don’t wait too long but don’t make a decision too fast and don’t have all the facts debating is vital to a decision.

    - **Note:** types of meetings process, knowledge sharing, or mission oriented/ problem solving. Good one on one meetings are rolling and people come prepped with notes. Good one on ones are important in life. 8 people at a meeting max everyone should get the outline and the meeting should.
      Have an outside view of a meeting where people are lending both know how and position power. The decision should be made by the lowest competent person who can see from the front. Commit to a path in a business decision. You will never have all the facts you need to take the right amount of time given facts and circumstances to give yourself the best shot. Not too long or short
- Management and companies are a team game. Management requires what might not seem like decisions being made constantly but is and even if it seems like an unimportant meeting tieing meaning to the meeting is vital. Acquire information create leverage make decisions. Get internal and external feedback. Vary your sources of information with redundant sources writing is more for you than the actual output. Information gathering is key to managerial leverage which is the key to management. 3 ways to increase leverage increase rate of work shift mix of tasks to higher leverage increase leverage associated with activities. Timelines creates leverage managers should focus on the few highest leverage activities. Negative leverage can be produced by depression waffling or waiting on a decision or meddling instead of letting others do things themselves. Delegate and monitor performance but don’t meddle it’s still your job to make sure it’s done well after delegating. Managerial forecasts are vital managers should use calendars as production planning tool for their time not a passive thing. You should build slack in your schedule to do non mission critical side projects or handle fire drills. Interruptions was the biggest product issue for managers. Have standard responses to frequent interruptions or create batch processing for questions like office hours don’t ignore interruptions but create better systems for them.

    - **Note:** Managers cannot be interupted. Always tie what you're doing to genuine value. Make high leverage decisions. Get constant feedback diverse input and increase the learning rate. timelines artifically create leverage. Build clack in your schedule. Do deep work
- Plan flow around processing time and limiting steps in a process. Process data assemble information test plans. Constantly using unit tests everything is a constraint optimization problem. Trade off man power vs materials vs quality to find the best combination. Do unit testing. Make sure to make corrections as early in the process as possible finished goods cost more than inputs so throwing out a rotten egg when you get it is better than serving it. Likewise create key successs metrics around process and quality. Need go measure and balance inventory levels and quality metrics and process. Match input and countable measure with quality metric both need to be quantifiable. Process is a black box leading indicators give you a look into the black box try to get as much info as possible about the box a look into the box but these must also be good indicators or else the headstart isn’t helpful. Stagger chart show your projections with the expected demand cycle for that product so if demand is seasonal you project around that to better deploy resources. Build to order vs build to forecast which is riskier. Parkinson’s law the work people do conform to the then they’re asked to do it not the actual task. Monitor the quality of your output at every level and catch as early as possible. Increase productivity in the black box by working harder or working smarter changing the nature of work. High leverage activities. Use a flow chart to map your workflow then remove steps.
- In the 1980s globalization and email compresssing communication times were the 2 big movements. Intel had to shut down core dram businesses when they were out competed by Japan and focus fully on microprocessors their key competency. Sees digital world with constant flow of information. Middle managers are chief executives of a mini organization. Prepare yourself for disorder and great change from increasing technology. Prepare for chaos. Anticipate unexpected then make order from the disorder. Output of managers is based on the outputs of their teams. Create managerial leverage with task relevant feedback. Tighten managerial feedback loops through information decimation online with focused one on ones. These days competition is high so you’re in a company by yourself. Are you adding value or information or just going through motions. Add more value be the change not the receiver of it. Identifying and solving complex system problems are very different being a manager isn’t about being smart it’s about how you translate your knowledge to the organization to add value. Early project decisions provide leverage vs later ones 10x difference so be mindful with early design. You can only put people in position to be successful as a manager you can’t do it for them. Managing is motivation and training.

    - **Note:** Managers create leverage. Digital world with constant information slows. Middle managers need to take agency and prepare for chaos and leverage it. Anticipate the unexpected and get feedback with strong feedback loops. Managers must disseminate information and focus resources but cannot do the work. Just motivate and train. Take the systems view.
