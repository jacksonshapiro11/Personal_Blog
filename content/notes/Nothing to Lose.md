### Highlights

- There’s a fine balance between obsessing about your craft and being there for your family. It’s akin to walking a tightrope. Your legs are shaky, and you’re trying to find your center. Whenever you lean too far in one direction, you correct your course and end up over leaning in the other direction. So you correct by leaning the other way again. That’s the dance. You can’t achieve greatness by walking a straight line.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsp0tw4s9sc3hpaxnk7vcb6w))
    - **Note:** Success isn't linear its a dance between kicking it up and down the gears sometimes you're running in 6th gear then you need to kick it down to 2nd to attend to other things. Nothing is linear or easy but you need to keep the balance and the faith
- “It’s easier to get a smart person to do something hard than to get them to do something easy that doesn’t matter.”

  “When you know what needs to be done, inaction increases stress. You feel a lot less stress when you do the things within your control that move you closer to your objective. Action reduces stress.”

  “A lack of routine causes more problems than poor choices. Routines turn desired behavior into default behavior.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsp0y7p5ba59n7rzgmc9rb03))

    - **Note:** Hard problems are good problems procrastination is bad just try to move it forward every day and get a little closer to your goal action is better than stagnation and direction is better than action routines are vital because they make hard decisions defaults
- When you think long term, it prevents you from doing a lot of short-term behaviors naturally that either lead you astray, take you off the path of long-term thinking, or otherwise get in the way. If I have a problem with a co-worker, how I address it will be very different if I think I’m going to have a relationship with them for 10 years versus if I think they’re only going to be here for a few months. And if I treat them like it’s a transaction, they will behave like it’s a transaction. And then when they behave like it’s a transaction, it will reinforce my view that they’re not committed, that it’s just a job to them—it’s not a career—and it will change how I interact with them in the future. So this little thing can make a huge difference in how you treat other people, but [also in] how it spirals beyond that moment into something much larger ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsp10khzzb1s75m2yvxtx1vt))
    - **Note:** Long term vs transactional thinking. When you think long term you are building something together and that's important when you think for the moment you are disadvantaging yourself for the long term. Create sustainable long term relationships and invest in the future. Game theory tit for tat cooperation long term. It's obvious over the long term what games people are playing but we make decisions in the moment using only past information and predictions about the future the tit for tat game theory example is a vital look into how we can shape out world and relationships to position ourselves for the highest EV outcomes long term.
