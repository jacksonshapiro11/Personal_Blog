### Highlights

- Both Leon Hess and Sam Bronfman built multi-billion dollar family dynasties. Each identified and corrected their fathers' failing businesses, creating a generational inflection point. Story of the father imbedded in the son. His dads failure lead to his successs. His dad was in coal saw oil was the future. Starts the company at 19 with one used truck. Dads business went bankrupt he couldn’t go to college as a result. He has to work finding clams instead for 50 cents an hour learns hard work. He builds his business selling residual oil refiners didn’t want to sell they were throwing it out. Like Sam zemurray. He buys for cheap reheated the oil to refine then sells it. Sees opportunity where others saw trash. He thinks he can be fast where others are slow and it works. Formative life moment is during ww2 he works for Patton transportation and learns operational excellence. Hess figured a way for the red all express which is how Patton fueled his offensive helped him maintain his speed.

  This is episode 116, I think it was six, seven years ago. And in that episode is the very first time that I used the phrase generational inflection point, which is this idea that a single individual can change the trajectory of his entire family For generations to come. Sam Bronfman was that from the Bronfman family dynasty. Leon Hess is for the Hess family. So in that, the reason I thought of this when I was reading about Leon Hess and I got to this section of the book is because Sam's a young kid working in the family business and he realizes That his dad is doing it wrong. His dad has the wrong idea. So Sam's dad sold horses and every time, and Sam's like a little kid when this is happening. And so, and Sam's, you know, following his dad around and working the family business, very similar to what Leon's trying to do with his father when he was really young. And so every time Sam's dad would sell a horse, he would take the customer to a bar for a celebratory drink. And young Sam realizes, hey, dad, we're on the wrong side of this transaction. We're in the wrong business that the guy selling us the drink is making more money than the guy selling the horse. And that observation, that single observation, that single idea that the young Sam Brompton has changes the Brompton family forever. Sam proceeds to create, goes on and creates the world's largest liquor distilling firm. They branch out into all kinds of different businesses. To this day, the family, 150 years later, 120 years later, however long it's been, is still one of the wealthiest families in the world. So Leon realizes, dad, we're in the wrong business and proceeds to switch the product too. ([Time 0:08:43](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a343996a-fa76-41ad-bded-64fd60e92837))
- He rode many waves to success. Hess' logistics expertise allows him to be fast where others are slow the oil would harden if you were slow learned this during the war, increased fuel oil demand from cars and heating, and the expanding US economy and middle class drove his success. These led to America's growing oil appetite and key relationships, like with David Willans, further propelled his growth. He had a vital mentor. Leon backwards integrates into oil starts with a truck then after 30 years builds the largest refiner in the western hemisphere. Did it backwards. Always made time for family going back to work after coming home for dinner.

  At one point, I think they said that, I think the book says that Leon has something like 80% of the market share for fuel oil. Why? Because to move fuel oil successfully, you are required to move quickly and you have to have a mastery of logistics because if it's not kept at the right, first of all, it's not delivered Fast enough. And if it's not kept warm enough, it will transform from liquid into like it cools and it hardens. So the first part of Leon's post-World War II wave is the fact that now he is maybe has maybe the most advanced logistics training for any of his competitors and he's able to transport This faster and more efficiently than anybody else. So number one, he's just able to get the job done. Number two, fuel oil is now going to have a massive increase in demand. Demand for fuel oil surged to unprecedented levels as it's used for power generation, electricity plants used it, and in shipping expanded. Hess called fuel oil the workhorse fuel of industrial America for its uses in utility boilers, factory machinery, and heating large buildings. Number three, you have this massive explosion in demand of driving. The industry grew to serve a burgeoning U.S. Middle class that wanted and needed to drive more, And Hess metamorphosized from a small dealer into one of the largest gasoline retailers on the East Coast. This is part of Hess's constant march to go to the source. Remember, he starts a fuel delivery, then storage, then refineries, then retail gas stations, and then finally oil drilling and exploration. Number four, this is a massive increase. This is wild to me. The expansion of the industry that Hess is operating in, in 45 years. So let's start the dawn of the 20th century, when Rockefeller was at his peak, production was 174,000 barrels a day. Even at that size, that can make Rockefeller probably the richest person on the planet. You fast forward 45 years, where we are in the story, where a young Leon Hess is building his oil company, the production is now 4.6 million barrels a day. And then number five, Leon starts building relationships and contacts, which are going to lead to greater sources of capital. So if you really think about what Leon's post-World War II wave, number one, he's got the logistics expertise, right person, right set of skills, right time. Number two, the demand for fuel oil is exploding. Number three, the U.S. Economy expands drastically, increasing the purchasing power of the middle class. And as a result, demand for gasoline skyrockets. Number four, America's insatiable appetite for all types of oil. And then number five, he finally unlocks relationships in capital, including going public, which I'll talk about in a minute. But I need to talk about one of maybe the most important relationships that he ever builds is this relationship with this guy named David Willans. David is almost like, essentially, it's going to wind up being his father-in But I would think of him as almost like the father that Leon chose. So David is actually the attorney general of New Jersey. ([Time 0:20:06](https://share.snipd.com/snip/050d1003-08b6-4a30-87d2-9d13d18dfc73))
- Leon Hess built the largest refinery in the Western Hemisphere in the U.S. Virgin Islands due to its unique tax benefits and logistical advantages. He knew the laws very deeply. Read everything and created every legal advantage possible. He secured foreign refiner status and domestic refinery subsidies. Hess also obtained a local monopoly, tax exemptions, and reimbursements. His gas stations simplified operations by not offering car maintenance services and initially refusing credit cards to speed up the process. He focused when others went broad. This was also positioned in the perfect place to get oil from the Middle East and south America into the us. Oil industry is crazy where bribes are just the way to do business.

  Now, fast forward three decades later, he winds up building the largest refinery in the Western Hemisphere, and he does so in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Why? Why U.S. Virgin Islands? Because U.S. Virgin Islands hold a key advantage. So the location that he chooses for this refinery allowed Leon to take advantage of federal tax benefits. This may be the only place in the world that he could have done this. So the refinery is able to secure foreign refiner status, which allows it to circumvent federal rules that require the use of higher cost U.S. Flagged vessels when shipping oil to the East Coast, while simultaneously at the same time, also receiving subsidies from the United States Department of Energy as a domestic refinery. There is a line I read in the autobiography of Trader Joe, the guy that started the grocery store, that I think about over and over again. And he says, as I learned time and time again, success in business often rests on a minute reading of the regulations that impact your business. That's exactly what Leon Hess did here. He picked the one place on the planet. We had this combination of unfair, and I don't mean it's legal because it's completely legal, of unfair advantages. And I want to stack another unfair advantage on top of this, or Leon stacked another unfair advantage on top of this. It was going to be a local monopoly. There was only going to be one company allowed to build a refinery on the island. Leon had to win this. In fact, there's a funny interview with the governor of the Virgin Islands talking about how he negotiated, how Leon Hess negotiated. Says from the day Leon Hess entered my office, he did not leave the Virgin Islands until the deal was consummated. And then Leon also negotiated for another series of benefits. So he also gets 16 years tax-free in St. Croix, partial government reimbursement for dredging a channel and free use of that channel for 16 years. Now, this minute reading of regulations, it's not like this is a one-off. This is not something that Leon did one time. He found another loophole and another regulatory advantage. Leon figured out ways to make laws work to his advantage. In one instance, he found that oil would not be considered an import, and thus therefore taxed, right, as one, if he bought it from St. Lucia to St. Croix by barge. So he took apart his large ships, had the engine propulsion cut in two, and the bulkheads welded on each side, and then pinned them back together. The pins were huge, so technically the drive portion could be disconnected from the cargo portion. While it may not appear so to the untrained eye, legally, these boats qualified as barges. So the massive quantities of oil they carried were exempted from the taxes that would otherwise be levied. So now he has the largest refinery in the Western Hemisphere. It's perfectly located because he's able to refine oil coming from the Middle East and South America. He refines it in the U.S. Virgin Islands and then ships that fuel to customers on the East Coast of America. Now, there is an idea in here where if you're looking to do something in your business, I bet you if you study other industries or other companies in your same industry, they attempted Something in the past that was similar and yet forgotten. He's building this in, I think, the 1960s. He wasn't the first to look in the Caribbean. He wasn't the first oil baron to build a refinery in the Caribbean. Shell built one in 1918 in Curacao, and Standard Oil had built a refinery in Aruba in 1929. And so there's all these stories in the book about how important this one refinery was to his business. And you see this with his actions. The refinery was incredibly important to Leon. So he would fly in every Friday to inspect his refinery to review its operations, finances, and crude state. Across the refining industry, stories of Leon's persistence at the plant became legend. Leon would show up and check units at 2 a.m. To make sure they were running properly. At the same time he's building his refineries, he's also starting to expand into gas stations. He opens his first gas station in 1960 in New Jersey by the end of the decade. He had gas stations in 16 states. There was an interesting line here that I didn't realize he purposely did the opposite and simplified what his gas station did compared to the existing competitors. Unlike his competitors, the Hess station attendants didn't change your oil. They didn't carry batteries, tires, or windshield wipers, or have car mechanics on site. And for a long time, they wouldn't even take credit cards because Leon felt that slowed the refueling process down. ([Time 0:25:42](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d3220d91-8950-43fd-bb32-b78e6c230ec5))

  Details, details, details over and over again. He was obsessed with the details of delivery. At budget meetings, he would quiz the head of the company's trucking division on the amount of life left in the tires. There's several quotes throughout the book on the importance of cleanliness. He was obsessed with things being clean. He says, the first thing I look at in an oil tanker is the engine room bilge. Clean bilges denote good housekeeping. He said that in 1987. Remember, he starts his company in 1933. He dies in ([Time 0:40:52](https://share.snipd.com/snip/24a88585-62db-48b2-bb74-ef0d18431c7d))
- Leon Hess could recall the margins of every East Coast gas stations. He thought differently and made toy trucks for kids to buy. Would talk to everyone and everyone loved him as a result. Did this as a marketing stunt but becomes a collectors item. He had the decision on every design. He took over the jets turns then from the worst run team to the best. Bought 20% but then bought all other owners out turned it into a world class business. He sells the team when he dies and eventually Hess is sold for 53bn after his death.

  He says, Brad wrote, I find that slightly understaffed teams are more focused and spend less time doing redundant busy work. Be deliberately understaffed is a really interesting idea. The personal attention that Leon showed to his employees is something that's repeated over and over again as well. Every night, this is one of the refineries, every night he'd make a point of sitting down and eating dinner with the guys. He would walk around the room and shake everybody's hand. That kind of recognition brought loyalty from many employees, many of whom would describe themselves as being very devoted to him. Back to Leon's impressive attention to detail, he could recite the margin of every gasoline station on the East Coast. So I actually spent seven hours over two days with John Mackey, the founder of Whole Foods. John Mackey can do the exact same thing. He could pass a Whole Foods and he could tell you what their revenue number was, what operating income was, what their margins were. He had this encyclopedic knowledge of the financial performance and all the numbers of all the Whole Foods. It sounds exactly what Leon Hess had in his head for all of his gas stations. Leon Hess would also do things that other competitors were not doing. I remember this when I was a kid. It was Leon's idea. You remember the Hess toy trucks? I actually had these toy trucks when I was a kid. And the idea to make them actually emerge from a conversation that Leon had with a friend who was also a toy manufacturer at a football game in the 1960s.
