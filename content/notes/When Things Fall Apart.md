### Highlights

- We need to retrain our mind. Our thoughts shape our habits. Turn reality around. When you’re in this pattern sometimes you just do something different than you’d normally do and see what happens give up on your normal response. Our perception is just our projection. Lighten up and be kind to yourself. Be unpredictable. We’re not a problem Just a misunderstood person. See our position as workable. The path is the goal. It’s always changing. Don’t worry about the destination just the ever changing path to get there and embrace it. A better future is created by a better present. The only way to have a better future is to realize its actions in the now it always will be. Everything is the path and the path is the goal. Relate to each moment. Everything is workable. This puts us always at a crossroads. Use difficultty to wake up. We can get bitter or happy. Everything is workable. Be curious look at your mind offer chaos a cup of tea. Don’t turn away. Relax and lighten up. Allow your compassion to blossom and never give up on yourself.
- We don’t experience the world fully unless we are willing to give up everything away. We don’t have ample time to do things later and we shouldn’t escape from our experiences. We understand we will die and so why not take the result as the path and live every day like it was our last. Every touch and smell enjoy as if it was our last. Wake up to how little time is left. Samaya bond is a commitment to bind a student and a teacher and never separate regardless of the pain. This is a sacred oath. It’s a marriage with reality. A commitment to sanity. We are tricked that we need to commit to sanity and realize we will never be more present than we are right now. We are already awake. Looking for alternatives is what keeps us from appreciating this is the best life we have and we are blind to reality. We need to relax in our life. These samayas are body speech and mind. To experience the presence of reality breaks us out of our mental rut brings us back to reality. Our teacher is not separate from experience it is our experience. People want unconditional love but then realize we also want to be loved on our own terms. This creates a divide in the mind. The challange is to feel genuine and experience the discomfort. We always position to give ourselves an out but here we cannot. We must surrender. We cannot get out there is no exit. We must discover the wisdom mind that lies below and within us all. We don’t experience the world fully unless we are willing to give it all away and give it all up. No escape route. Not holding anything back not thinking there is time to live later. In the beginning our habit of running is so deep seated we experiment with trick of being bound. Sit on the hot seat and commit to life. Do we commit to playing it safe and take refuge in that or being a warrior and taking a leap.
- Don’t struggle against what’s happen to us move toward difficulties. Practice to liberate ourselves from a narrow perspective created by craving aggression fear with others and ourselves. We don’t have to forget the joy of every moment and can be happy in them. Dealing with trauma. The world is chaotic how do we deal with it. 1 is no more struggle. Like in meditation we look at our demons and don’t run from them but see them as they are and even embrace them. 2. Use poison as medicine. Don’t run from but tootsie and embrace it. Grow from this poison. Breathe in and connect with poison fully then breathe out. Turn mishaps into path of enlightenment. 3. Use anything that happens as awakened energy. Charnal ground was the Nepal burial ground which is where they dropped dead bodies to be eaten by vultures. Where in our life can we see something like that and see its enlightenment in the human condition not the pain. Chaos is basic energy whether we see that as heaven or hell is perspective.
- We learn all our teaching but then life and pain happens and we’re supposed to be nice but we’ve had a bad day and can’t be. When we get squeezed like this and get curious about who we are we can start learning and be insightful. This is a key time to get curious and learn but very hard. We learn where we are stuck and can’t move forward. We need to experience this big squeeze and embrace it. Sit in the discomfort like many before us to grow.
- Opinions create our ego and recognizing opinions allows us to realize our ego and cultivate egolessness. See opinions as opinions and let them go. We become so attached to these opinions but better to just recognize and let them go. Hold opinions with non aggression we can see an idea as right or wrong but we should cultivate love for those that disagree. Aggression creates pain which makes the world worse but we should make the world better. Don’t let opinions sweep us away so we can see the world more clearly. Do everything as if it was the only thing that mattered and realize it doesn’t matter at all. Do your best job every day but realize each day is a new day promising hope. Keep hearts and minds open. Cultivate mind that doesn’t grasp right or wrong. Then don’t give up on yourself or others. Then live one moment at a time.
- Lose your grounding in reality. Realize there isn’t one right way to do thing just a constantly changing world. Their teacher would impress this on them By teaching them very strict rituals then one day completely changing them without warning. This informs you of the impermanence of life. What saves the world is gratitude and curiosity. We cannot save the world we can just get curious of others. Wonder about others. The 5 transcendent actions are exertion generosity discipline meditation and patience. But we cannot use these actions as a way to feel secure. These aren’t about perfection but exploration of these ideas. Relax to the richness of the moment. Instead of agreeing or disagree experience. Generosity is giving this to people. Let go of attachment and give up what we feel we can’t that is generosity. We can do this and give the gift of fearlessness by being generous. We should discipline things that push us to escape from reality to run from ourselves. This is a structure. Discipline finds the right balance between tight and lose to be present. Can’t to too chaotic or upright need middle way. Patience is antidote of anger. Opposite of patience is aggressive. Not jumping at something but when things happen digesting them. Relax and to open to what happens like stalking an animal. Exertion isn’t pushing your it’s embracing the day when you want to stay in bed. Touch into your desire for enlightenment. Connect with bigger perspective and energetic joy. This spurs you to do things instead of stagnating. Get action. Meditation allows us to continue this journey. Meditation doesn’t add to the experience everything comes and goes as it is. Not filling the space to be unconditionally open. This seems impossible. But the more we sit with this impossibility the more we recognize its reality. When we cling to the past we are lying to ourselves because nothing can be held. Rest in the present moment and when distracted return to the moment. It’s natural to long for old habits and nostalgia and we just recognize that and let it be.
- We shouldn’t restrict ourselves from suffering. In pain we experience uniformity across the human condition. We discover our pain in all beings by accepting and embracing pain. We create empathy through cultivating a soft spot. Breathe in suffering and breathe out happiness as a meditation. Don’t run from pain. We open our heart through basic openness and tenderness. This feeling of borichita is available when we let go of ourselves and open ourselves up to the world connect with true emotion. This is like a journey to a mountain top to be transcendent but with borichita we are going down the mountain to experience the pain of others. When we have a bad emotion we should breathe it in ingest it and send out good vibes to yourself and all others feeling this pain. Breathe in the pain release love. Even our own pain. Breathe in inadequacy and breathe out confidence even for your friends enemies these people are as confused and stuck as you are so send them love.
- We must be compassionate with ourselves before we can be compassionate with others. Create an open and non judgmental space can we see ourselves and others and open up emotionally to truly be with others. We need to accept ourselves and our feelings first. She has a genuine conversation with a homeless person who is always ignored never cared about. People just want to be asked and cared for. Take a genuine interest in others. That’s what people want. What we reject in others is what we reject in others. We project our problems on the world and situations. Things hurt when they related to you. We create blame which creates a barrier between us and society. We do this to protect our hearts instead of owning pain. Blaming builds a wall touching the soft spot of blame is compassion. We get an answer by blaming others ourselves but this gives us a resolution. Neither is great. The feeling we have to be right or wrong closes us down. This creates issues. Things aren’t right or wrong. We must choose a middle way. We must realize when we make things wrong we do so out of a need for security and grounding. When we make things right we still look for security instead of pushing for security we must not shut anyone out and leave our hearts open to that open space. Absolute right and wrong is a lie of the universe. This starts with feeling what we are going through and getting in touch with the parts of us we hate. Open further to our feelings. Get in touch feelings. Compassion for ourselves leads to compassion for others. When we celebrate the parts we hate we trigger a massive mindset shift.
- We learn truth by studying ourselves. It’s our imperative to find out what you believe. Kindness is also important. We need clarity honesty and kindness. We get caught up in kindness and we lose our grounding. Kindness is a way to connect with unconditional joy. How do we train in compassion discipline is imprtant but we don’t need to be harsh. We need to be kind in meditation and life. We see the universe in ourselves and kindness to ourselves is kindness to the universe. We need to see where we are blocked and we use this as Ammo against ourselves but instead of being tough we should be soft. Being honest and kind with ourselves is the beginning of growing up.
- We can see obstacles as something in our way or our friend. Nothing goes away until it tells us what we need to know. We have external obstacles and build internal ones and only once we understand the internal and external ones do we understand the issue and move forward. Mara’s are ways we try to avoid what is happening. 4 kinds 1. Is seeking pleasure 2. Is trying to reinvent and ground ourselves when we get rug pulled we resist change and instead of changing we revert to our old person. 3. How we use emotions to stay asleep. We can sit with emotion and let it pass but we feed it to our detriment instead of accepting it. 4. Is how we fear death. Seeking security and perfection by controlling the moment is death because eventually we are faced with an unknown and have to accept it and move on. To live is to be constantly uncertain to be willing to die over and over again. Every moment is fresh. Death is wanting to hold onto what you have and be reassured in this feeling. Comfort is death. An unchanging world is death embracing change is embracing life. Awake and alive by letting go being present experience each moment to its fullest. Investigate how we close down in stress so we can undo it.
- 3 truths impermanence suffering and egolessness. These are inseparable from the human experience. Everything is constantly evolving. Suffering is a fear of impermanence. We cannot have pleasure without pain but we think it is. We can’t have life without death. Egolessness is a gain when we’re not concerned with ourselves we let life radiate outwards. Recognize these 3 things in life and be mindful and inquisitive of how we react to know ourselves better. When egolessness arises when we have a fresh breath and quiet of our mind. We also experience this when we have a shock and don’t know how to respond. Peace is the 4th mark of existence that comes when we see the infinite pairs of opposites trading off against each other. We find deep peace in this.
- The process of becoming unstick is rewiring our brain to perceive a different reality and is hard. We must exist in the middle way. We want a resolution one way or the other we don’t want to live in ambiguity but cling to the stories that are familiar to us but we must exist and push through this uncomfortable doubt by sitting in it not running from it. We see loneliness as an enemy. We should have a non threading relationship with loneliness. 6 ways of cool loneliness 1. Less desire 2. Contentment 3. Avoiding unnecessary activity 4. Complete discipline 5. Not wandering in the world of desire 6. Not Seeking security from one’s discursive thoughts. We need to escape the feeling that escaping loneliness will make us happy. It won’t. Be lonley with no alternatives. Sometimes we invent plans to run from our loneliness. Don’t distance ourselves from loneliness. Relax with loneliness. We need to sit with loneliness we need to accept we don’t know anything with certainty sit with loneliness ambiguity. Wandering in the world of desire means looking to external things like food or experiences. We grab for the familiar this comes from the feeling of never growing up when we’re uncomfortable we want to open the fridge and it be home. We need to leave home and become homeless so we can grow up. We cannot get security from our own internal chatter. Drop who we think we are others think we are or want to be and see as we actually are. In the moment of sadness and longing relax don’t grasp.
- Non attachment enjoy things fully then let them go. 8 world dharmas pleasure and pain. Praise and blame. Fame and disgrace. We like gain hating losing what we have. Rooted in hope and fear. These are all in part made up and we should observe and watch them. When we look into this we understand ourselves and the human concept more. When we’re hooked by something we’re caught up in these dharmas. Tiny thought arises that escalates and we’re captured by the dhsrmas. Get curious investigate our feelings and why we feel that way like a child. We want to know and we look into our habitual behaviors to better understand ourselves and the world. Understand the human condition through curiosity and not judgement. Me must start with ourselves then abstract to the world.
- Mindfulness is giving up hope of being somewhere else to be present in the moment. Dharma is realizing the world in hopeless and no one is coming to save us person or god so we must embrace life. We’re addicted to hope but we need to give it up. We’re always looking for something or lacking something we must give that up and realize we have enough before we can accept we are tonight. Give up hope we can be saved from who we are. Don’t distract yourself because of fear. We become uneasy and we grasp for things. If we stop grasping we gain confidence. All worries are rooted in our fear of death. We experience death in the constant failure of everyday. We must accept change and death in everyday life. Relax in the insecurity. Face reality we will die and we must give up hope to become happy.
- The core of teaching is non aggression. Don’t remain ignorant of ourselves. Mindfulness allows us to relate to our experience with presence and without judgement. Refraining is the next step when you don’t try to change or grab for things when you’re bored you just experience what is as it is. This refraining stops you and allows you to pause and experience/ see life. We cause ourselves pain when we compound our problems. Bad things happen and we can accept those and lean in or reject and compound them creating more pain. We create our pain. Be proactive. Pause for a moment allow anything to come up get in touch with restlessness by giving it space. When we’ve seen ourselves completely we are still we don’t need to run and want. There is no compulsiveness we don’t overdo anything when we have a good relationship with ourselves. We’re not reaching but accepting of life. We don’t overdo anything and cause harm to ourselves. We’re at home in the world and in ourselves we’re like a calm lake where everything can be seen. The root of our harm is ignorance. Not causing harm is staying awake and in tune with how we feel good or bad.
- When you breathe out let the out breath sit there and lose yourself in it. Sit in the nothingness of the death in between the last breath and next. The idea of meditation isn’t to focus on your breath but nothing. The breath was used as a proxy for nothing. Be unconditional compassionate with thoughts. Label all thoughts thinking and let them dissolve into the mind. Don’t ignore relax don’t repress. Don’t get rid of thoughts but see the true nature. When thoughts carry you away and label thinking. The worst times are the ones we give ourselves. To be enlightened we must observe all habits with loving kindness with ourselves. Mindtree is losing the mask of self deception. We’re not trying to solve a problem. We don’t want pain to go away. Giving up control and letting concepts and ideals fall apart. This realizes we’re not the beginning or end but this feeling is a normal human feeling everyone feels and basic nowness is always here but all feelings come and go. When we buy into disapproval we practice it. Practice gentleness and letting go. Meet things with curiosity. We have a constantly thinking mind and a deeper wisdom mind. Tame restless mind with intelligence. 3 kinda of awakening from sleep, 2. From life into death 3. To enlightenment from dream of delusion. We run from pain and life rob ourselves of the present. Don’t run too much face our demons and pain life is too short to fear. There is no cure just living and embracing life. Open our minds when people are poisoned by self doubt and become cowards this is the sign of a dark age. Practice loving kindness to illuminate dark times. Don’t resist life get curious.
- Fear is the feeling of getting closer to the truth. Progress is the courage to die continuously step forward with courage. We cannot blame others or ourselves for things. Intimacy with fear makes us present and collapses our drama. Awakening requires letting go and we can turn into that pain or away from it. Things are in transition nothing else we goes the way we want. To stick with uncertainty sitting in the midst of chaos and not panicking. This is the spiritual path. Catch ourselves in this pain and recenter. Discomfort provides clarity. We’re given opportunities every day to open up or shut down. We’re stepping into unknown territory facing fear. When in fear we can freeze or get in touch with pain. Egolessness is when everything falls away and the energy is just there and it opens up. In Meditation we make friends with hopes and fears and then in our lives we can be more awake. In meditation we see what’s happening. Eventually thoughts come up and we’re able to acknowledge and relax. Learn into discomfort of life. This moment is the teacher. Be present.
