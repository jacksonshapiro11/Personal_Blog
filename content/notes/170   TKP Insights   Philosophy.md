### Highlights

- The Strategic Advantage of Trump's Opponents
  Transcript:
  Speaker 7
  Like they're pathologically evil or a narcissist or toxic or whatever. And so the idea that you can afford not to be hyper rational and strategic and in control of all of your faculties, you're in really bad shape. I think you could argue that what Trump does, and I don't think this has to get political, what Trump does is I don't think it's so much a function of genius on his part, so much as a confluence of personality traits, so enrages his opponents and disorients them and is so the opposite of what they have experience dealing with that it's almost like a self-protective bubble, right? Because it's like he's inside the loop of the opponent and because they're not thinking rationally, patiently, strategically, they're just like, ah!
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, he's in your operating system, right? Like he's literally just hacked your brain and he's making you respond in a way that's advantageous to him and disadvantages to you. How do we overcome that? Like how in the moment do you, like is there any stoic advice or anything that you've learned where it's like, do you take? I think there's one quote about sort of reciting the alphabet before you respond. ([Time 0:08:48](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5f96c24a-c6aa-405e-bac5-3619ad2cf927))
    - **Note:** Anger is what gets in our way most and we often need to pause when we’re in a state of passion and step back before we do something we regret. 2000 year old advice to recite the alphabet when you’re angry and of you do t practice controlling your anger in the moment you’re hosed. These moments are when we need calm most and it’s often when we lose our heads so we need to be more calm and composed.
- Can Teaching People to Use Their Eyes Like Olympic Athletes Improve their Performance?
  Key takeaways:
  - People can improve their experience by learning to use their eyes like Olympic athletes
  - Teaching people to focus and narrow their attention can lead to faster movement
  - Narrowing attention is not natural but can be learned
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  And what they're talking about is something that we can teach other people to do. And we're not going to be able to take somebody who is really struggling to be in shape and turn them into a gold medalist. That's not the point here. That's not most people's goal. But can we improve their experience in some way by teaching them to do with their eyes what these Olympic athletes are doing? The answer is yes. You can tell people just like I have you to focus their attention. Choose a target. Imagine there's a spotlight shining just on it. Don't pay much attention to what's in your periphery almost as if you have like blinders on, right? You can pay attention to those distractors. People can do that. We have them talk to us about like, well, what is it that you're focused on? What's catching your attention right now? Those are easy instructions to understand and it's easy to make your eyes do it. What's important though is that that's not what their eyes do naturally. When they're walking or when they're running, people do take a sort of wider perspective. They broaden their scope of attention relative to what these instructions are having them do. And when we taught people that narrowed style of attention, what we found is that they moved 23% faster in this course that we had set up from the start line to the finish line. It was always exactly the same distance. And we were using our stop watches to see how fast did they move. ([Time 0:19:02](https://share.snipd.com/snip/65f2687c-7804-41f7-9948-aae7e75abb8d))
    - **Note:** Our physical and mental abilities combine to shape our perception fat people see distances as farther and we can trick ourselves into thinking something isn’t as hard by focusing attention on markers. Like when running focusing 3 minutes ahead instead over being overwhelmed by 30 minutes ahead. Narrow the perception reality gap and increase focus. It’s harder when you take the wide view but when you narrow attention and focus in different areas you can make things easier.
- Make it clear what you’re grateful for acknowledging what went well poorly abs what you’re looking forward to is vital. We’re programmed for anger and to see the bad evolutionarily but we should fight to see the good it’s not the default. We need to live the best day today because it’s all we have and it could be gone instantly. We’re only promised today don’t live for tomorrow. ([Time 0:33:18](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0ded4b67-0d76-4bdb-81d8-78a31b13b2d6))

    - **Note:** We need to fight to be grateful because our fight or flight makes us predisposed to fear and anger and seeing the worst. Life is precious and we need to seize every day.
- The Stoics' View on Emotions and Moral Development
  Key takeaways:
  - The Stoics believe in the moral development of emotions and aligning them with one's values.
  - They advocate for cultivating a good kind of fear called cautiousness and a rational desire.
  - The third layer of emotions involves reacting through reason and slowing down responses.
  - Having a healthy aversion to threat and a charitable disposition of pleasureableness is desirable.
  - Monitoring one's impressions and reflecting on reactions can help regain control of emotions.
  - Writing and journaling are effective tools for reflection and clarifying thinking.
  - Emotions gain power through the articulation of words and thoughts.
  - There is a gap between thoughts and actions and it is not easy to bridge.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 3
  So these are all the emotions that if you let him run, run him up, they can derail you. Now, the Stoics are developmentalists. So in this regard, again, they're really forward thinking. They're into moral development of the emotions because that's where they think you really can, if you recalibrate your values, it has to be also with your emotions lining up to what you believe to be the right values. So they think you should start trying to cultivate a good kind of fear. And they actually have a name for it, which is cautiousness. They think you should start cultivating a good kind of desire and they give it a name.
  Speaker 1
  And this is the third layer.
  Speaker 3
  We're into the third layer, absolutely Shane. In this third layer is a kind of rational desire. So you're not going after something with sticky acquisitiveness or kind of sticky attachment.
  Speaker 1
  So you're reasoning, you're not reacting.
  Speaker 3
  You're reacting a bit, but your reaction is filtered through your reason. And it's slowed down a little bit. You've had a chance to sort of press the pause button a bit. I mean, you may not get fully there. This is in some ideal way, but this is what you're after. You're kind of trying to slow down the response so that what you now come to think is the right way to react and the right way to see that thing outside that so bruised your ego before isn't necessarily as an insult. Maybe the person was deluded. Maybe move on. Don't get pissed off by it or something of that sort. I think of it as you're not stuck on the object of anger. You're not stuck on the object of desire. You're not stuck on the threat out there. You have a kind of healthy aversion to threat. You have a healthy approach to things that you want. And you have a healthy, well, they also give you one for joy, a healthy pleasure that's maybe, you know, this is their word rational exuberance, but you get the idea. It's actually our word for charity. The Greek word is chara and ch and it turns into charity. It's a kind of charitable disposition of pleasureableness that comes along with doing things. So they're all calm, equitable, serene kinds of emotions. Do we get there? Most of us, not fully. Should we aspire to get there? Yeah. And so that third layer is the one that you kind of want to keep in mind as you try to stem some of the more debilitating emotions that are hard to manage.
  Speaker 1
  How do we do that though? So a lot of that sounds like that moment of pause between the second and third layer between feeling anger and then how do you teach yourself not to reason, but to give yourself a pause so that you can reason, right? And now your reason can take control of your emotions. Like, how do we regain control of that?
  Speaker 3
  So the way they think about it is pretty graphic. They're thinking that you have some time. Now we know we don't always have time, but they're reconstructing it as if you have time. So you get this charged impulse that comes in. He's insulting me. You know, and then you get hot and heavy. I'm going to get pissed off. I'm going to get angry. So they think that you can monitor your impression. We call it an observing ego. You watch yourself a little bit. You watch how you're reacting or responding to the impulse or to that affront. And they even have ways of doing it. They're not going to sit you down in a therapist's office, but they are going to tell you at the end of the day to do some journaling. Yeah. This is what Seneca says. You know, the night is the night's quiet. My wife is asleep. She knows my habits. That's exactly what he says. And he says, you know, I got a little bit too angry at the doorman at the building who didn't recognize me and didn't give let me in. Very pedestrian kind of response. I wasn't seated at the head table at the banquet where all the dignitaries were. I thought I should be. Well, maybe I'm a little too puffed up about that. So the pause is sometimes built in in reflective moments. And you know, that is what psychotherapies about and they called themselves therapists of the psyche. The Greek word is therapy therapy of the soul or the psyche, but it's it's themselves with themselves, whether in letter writing or these meditations. They're called meditations. They're very discursive.
  Speaker 1
  It's not like Eastern meditation. So what does that work? Why does writing? Why is writing so effective? I mean, my hypothesis is sort of like it helps us reflect. It helps us clarify our thinking and helps us see our thinking. It puts a visual to it. But not only that, it sort of like makes sense of our experience to ourselves. It's that process for us.
  Speaker 3
  If you put words on your thought and you actually articulate them a bit and you drill that articulation into your head, they have actual practices. You know, they're not just meditated at the end of the day, but think in advance, pre-rehearse some of the bad things that could happen to you at the end, you know, during this day. And that will get you set up for it. So they're very much about emotions get their power by having words attached to them, by being discursive, by being thought that is articulated. We know there's a gap between what you think and say and what you actually do. There's not a perfect go-to there at all. ([Time 0:38:21](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1c8e668f-8613-46cf-a0fc-4981cc5d1602))
    - **Note:** Stoics 3 layers of emotions 1 is fight or flight direct reaction 2 is anger and fear where you not only let it sit but you create a story about it this person wronged me and I’m angry. 3 is using those emotions for good cultivating good desire or managing good anger and transcending the negative extranaloties of those feelings. You need to give yourself the space to digest and analyze feelings not just experience then mmm then have them manifest. Agency over feelings journal and analyze why you feel a certain way about an event and craft the narrative for yourself don’t be taken by the first narrative your subconscious creates. Moral development where you’re recalibrating emotions and gaining perspective. Line up with your beliefs and emotions did this person mean to slight me or were they in a rush or did I read it wrong. Monitor your reaction to the event and then journal or mentally discuss it later if you can’t fully reason it in the moment. Writing helps you articulate some moral hazards and understand your thinking better and further we can pre rehearse bad things and set ourselves up mentally to conquer these negative events before they happen like practice. Have a mantra that helps you empty your head. More eastern idea.
- The Role of Flashcards and Memorization in Learning
  Transcript:
  Speaker 4
  A lot of people say, you just give me somebody's deck so I can learn JavaScript or whatever. I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, like the whole point of flashcards and memorization is like, after you've learned this thing, you make the flashcard to help your future self remember it. The flashcard is not the moment of learning. So yeah, I feel the same way about the directives. Although there are different subjects in life where I want to know more about this or not. So the way actually the example that I gave about this kind of fat versus that kind of fat and these calories versus those calories, I don't care about that subject so much. So I would not want to read a 400 page book about nutrition and diet. That's an example where I just want somebody to tell me what to do. Tell me, you know, eat this, don't eat that. That's all. I don't need the details. And so because I feel that way about nutrition, I can imagine somebody else feeling that way about say technology or stoicism or language learning or whatever it may be like, no, I don't want to talk around this subject for 300 pages. Just can you tell me what to do in one page? And then I'll just do that. And I think this comes down to trust. If you trust the source, then you don't need all of the supporting evidence. ([Time 0:50:04](https://share.snipd.com/snip/642ad365-6a0a-4974-bdbf-bf5594cb3626))
    - **Note:** Directives you don’t own are a bit dangerous because you’re renting the knowledge so it’s much more important to take agency in knowledge and craft it make it yours don’t regurgitate it. When you don’t wanna own something find a source you trust. Like nutrition when you don’t care but it’s important you just don’t want to do all the work or can’t.

  Exactly. How to thrive in an unknowable future. And again, to give context, this is where I've read a bunch of books on this subject. I took a bunch of these book notes, lots of paragraphs, and kind of condensed them down into these, what is it, six directives. One, prepare for the worst. Since you have no idea what the future may bring, be open to the best and the worst. But the best case scenario doesn't need your preparation or your attention. So mentally and financially prepare for the worst case instead. Like insurance, don't obsess on it. Just prepare, then carry on appreciating the good times. How to thrive in an unknowable future. Number two, expect disaster. Every biography of a successful person has that line, and then things took a turn for the worse. So fully expect that disaster to come to you at any time. Really assume it's going to happen and make your plans accordingly. Not just money, but health, family, freedom. Expect all of it to disappear. Besides, you appreciate things more when you know that this may be your last time seeing them. Three, own as little as possible. Depend on even less. The less you own, the less you're affected by disaster. Four, and this is straight out of anti-fragile, choose opportunity, not loyalty. Have no loyalty to location, corporation, or your past public statements. Be an absolute opportunist, doing whatever's best for the future in the current situation, unbound by the past. Have loyalty for only your most important human relationships. Number five, choose the plan with the most options. I got that one from Kevin Kelly. The best plan is the one that lets you change your plans. For example, renting a house is buying the option to move at any time without losing money in a changing market. And number six, avoid planning. For maximum options, don't plan at all. Since you have no idea how the situation or your mood may change in the future, wait until the last possible moment to make each decision. ([Time 0:52:30](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a8a47df8-b54f-4c7d-b388-06e5ca23edf1))
    - **Note:** Create directives for each idea like here with anti fragility which is like a how to guide. Take the 6ish biggest ideas that give you a step by step of how to do the thing or invert and talk about how not to do the thing.

  So you and I are both Munger fans. So I'll just do this one more that is totally a, not a rip off, but Charlie Munger's idea, I think it was in poor Charlie Charlie's almanac, one of his speeches to one of the schools where he did the reversing it, like how to stop. From Israel guaranteed prescriptions from Israel. How did you just happen to know that? Guaranteed. Yeah, thank you. That was it. And I just, I loved that format. And so yeah, I tried my own version of that, which was how to stop being rich and happy. Number one, prioritize lifestyle design. You've made it. So it's all about you now. Make your dreams come true. Make your surroundings to please your every desire. Make your immediate gratification the most important thing. How to stop being rich and happy. Number two, chase that comparison moment. This is from the book Stumbling on Happiness. You have the old thing. You want the new thing. Yes, do it. Be happy for a week. Ignore the fact that the happiness only comes from the moment of comparison between the old and new. Once you've had your new thing for a week and it becomes the new norm, just go seek happiness from another new thing. Number three, buy, not rent. Why rent a house, a castle, a boat, or a car when you can buy? It's not about the thing. It's about identity. This shows who you are now. Number four, internalize your new status. You worked hard to get here. Celebrate. Relax. Admit that you're in a different class of people now with different needs. Understand there is no going back. Number five, how to stop being rich and happy. Be a connoisseur. Learn what others say is the finest. Insist on only the finest. You will now be unhappy with anything but the finest. Number six, get to know your possessions. Now that you own the best, it's time to focus on what you've got. From episode number 21, all about that lot of work. Pictures of your new possessions. Spend more time getting your surround sound and your heated floor just right. Work out the whole solar panel charging of your Tesla car. This is important. And lastly, number seven, how to stop being rich and happy. Acclimate to comfort. Eliminate every discomfort from your life. Some others when the world seems hard and is not living up to your standards. ([Time 0:55:25](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ab350baf-ddcd-4962-b535-723af0ba3dab))
    - **Note:** Charlie mungers idea of inversion for happiness. Avoid the bad to achieve the good.
- Having Kids and the Pursuit of Happiness
  Transcript:
  Speaker 5
  And because there's purpose, there are goals. Maybe not explicitly stated, but certainly outcomes that one is trying to achieve. Processes their turn on joy. And I think that's why having kids does such a thing for a person. They say having kids makes you grow up, makes you mature. Whatever. I think what it really does is it makes you focus on what's going to make you happy. And you got to make it happen in that process. And you quickly realize that happiness is not material. It's easy to have a temporary boost of happiness, but a material thing. And all it is is a change in position. There's that rate of change. Once the change doesn't happen anymore, you're back to being unhappy. So your whole life, if you want to be happy, you got to push towards something. Does that matter what you push towards? It doesn't matter what you want to be, what you're trying to become, but you got to be trying to become, you have to try to become something.
  Speaker 1
  You have an interesting philosophy on that too. You said don't tell people what you're trying to become. Just talk about what you have become.
  Speaker 5
  Yeah, man, social media age, right? We are infected with this disease of self promotion, but we're not self promoting what we've done. We're self promoting what we plan to do. And then we get a bunch of people to go, Oh man, good luck. ([Time 0:59:55](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3636cb18-5e13-4a36-985e-20314bb8f848))
    - **Note:** Happiness is in the rates of change and in pushing to something greater every day material goods are fleeting but deep underlying happiness comes from the process and moment. Don’t post about something on social media but do it. Posting is asymmetric downside either you don’t do it or you do it and you just kinda gained nothing. Posting creates an expectation that you can only fail at abs gives you the feeling of having done it because everyone is congratulating you. Utilize inertia he does the dishes after eating because he’s already moving. This can be applied to getting out of bed when you wake up just to get everything going. Using cross disciplinary concepts to reveal deep truths about universal systems.
