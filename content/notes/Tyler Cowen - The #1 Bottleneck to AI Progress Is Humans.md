### Highlights

- **Balancing Culture and Growth**
  * Different regions prioritize culture and growth differently.
  * The US balances these well, while other regions lean too much on one, hindering progress.
  * Why are the French so cultural but don’t make progress and were relative barbarians who make progress

  That makes me wonder, when you go around the world, because I know you go outside the Bay Area and the East Coast as well, and you talk about progress studies related ideas, what's the Biggest difference in how they're received versus the audience here?
  Tyler Cowen
  Well, the audience here is so, so different. Like you're the outlier place of America. And then where I normally am outside of Washington, DC, that's like the other outlier place. And in a way we're opposite outliers. I think that's healthy for me, both where I live and that I come here a lot and that I travel a lot. But you all are so like out there in what you believe. I'm not sure where to start. You all, you know, you come pretty close to thinking in terms of infinities on the creative side and the destructive side. And no one in Washington thinks in terms of infinities. They think at the margin. And like overall, I think they're much wiser than the people here. But I also know if everyone or even more people thought like the DC people, like our world would end, we wouldn't have growth. They're terrible. People in the EU are super wise. Like you have a meal with like some sort of French person who works in Brussels. It's very impressive. They're cultured. They have wonderful taste. They understand all these different countries. They know something about Chinese porcelain. And if like you lived in a world ruled by them, the growth rate would be negative 1%. So there's some way in which all these things have to balance. I think US has done a marvelous job at that and we need to preserve that. What I see happening, UK used to do a great job at it. UK somehow the balance is out of whack and you have too many non-growth oriented people in the cultural mix.

  The way you describe this French person you're having dinner with.
  Tyler Cowen
  Which I've had, this have dinners, yeah.
  Dwarkesh Patel
  And the food is good, too. I don't know. It kind of reminds me of you in the sense that you're also well-cultured and you all these different esoteric things. I don't know. What's the difference between you and what's the biggest difference between you and these French people you have dinner with?
  Tyler Cowen
  I don't think I'm well-cultured would be one difference. There are many differences. First, I'm an American. I'm a regional thinker. I'm from New Jersey. So I'm essentially a barbarian, not a cultured person. I have a veneer of culture that comes from having collected a lot of information. So I'll know more about culture than a lot of people. And that can be mistaken for being well-cultured, but it's really quite different. It's like a barbarian's approach to culture. It's like a very autistic approach to being cultured and should be seen as such. So I feel the French person is very foreign from me. And there's something about America they might find strange or repellent. And I'm just so used to it. I see intellectually how many areas we fall flat on or destructive, but it doesn't bother me that much because I'm so used to it.
  Dwarkesh Patel
  What is most misunderstood about autism?
  Tyler Cowen
  Well, if you look at the formal definition, it's all about deficits that people have, right? Now, if you define it that way, like no one here is autistic. If you define it some other way, which maybe we haven't been down yet, like a third of you here are autistic. I don't insist on owning the definition. I think it's a bad word. It's like libertarian. I would gladly give it away. But there is like some coherent definition where a third of you here probably would qualify. And this other definition where none of you would. And it's like kids in mental homes banging their head against the wall. So I don't know, it seems that whole issue needs this huge reboot.
  Dwarkesh Patel
  These DC people, you know, one frustration that tech people have is that they have very little influence, it seems, in Washington compared to how big that industry is. And industries that are much smaller will have much greater sway in Washington. Why is tech so bad at having influence in Washington?
  Tyler Cowen
  Well, I think you're getting a lot more influence than maybe you realize quickly through national security reasons. So the feds have not stopped the development of AI, whatever you think they should or should not do. It's basically preceded. And national security as a lobby, they don't care about tech per se, but it is meant that on a whole bunch of things in the future, you will get your way a bit more than you might be expecting. But a key problem you have is so much of it is in one area, and it's also an area where there's a dominant political party. Even within that political party, there's in many parts of California a dominant faction. And you compare yourself to like the community bankers who are in like so many American counties have connections to every single person in the house of representatives. Your issues in a way are not very partisan. The distortions you cause through your privileges are invisible to America. It's not like, you know, Facebook where some John Haidt has written some bestselling book complaining about what it is you do. There's not a bestselling book complaining about the community banks. And they are like ruthless and powerful and get their way. And I'm not going to tangle with them. And you all here are so far from that, in part because you're dynamic and you're clustered.
