Not to be obsessed with quail-fighting or other crazes like that. To hear unwelcome truths. To practice philosophy, and to study with Baccheius, and then with Tandasis and Marcianus. To write dialogues as a student. To choose the Greek lifestyle—the camp-bed and the cloak.” – do not waste time on nonsense. Lean into discomfort and hear the truth even if it hurts.

Not obsequious —but not aggressive or paranoid either. Generosity, charity, honesty. The sense he gave of staying on the path rather than being kept on it. That no one could ever have felt patronized by him—or in a position to patronize him. A sense of humor.”

- 3.4
  Don’t waste the rest of your time here worrying about other people—unless it affects the common good. It will keep you from doing anything useful. You’ll be too preoccupied with what so-and-so is doing, and why, and what they’re saying, and what they’re thinking, and what they’re up to, and all the other things that throw you off and keep you from focusing on your own mind. – focus on yourself
  You need to avoid certain things in your train of thought: everything random, everything irrelevant. And certainly everything self-important or malicious. You need to get used to winnowing your thoughts, so that if someone says, “What are you thinking about?” you can respond at once (and truthfully) that you are thinking this or thinking that. And it would be obvious at once from your answer that your thoughts were straightforward and considerate ones—the thoughts of an unselfish person, one unconcerned with pleasure and with sensual indulgence generally, with squabbling, with slander and envy, or anything else you’d be ashamed to be caught thinking. – avoid negative thoughts
  He does only what is his to do, and considers constantly what the world has in store for him—doing his best, and trusting that all is for the best. For we carry our fate with us —and it carries us. – live your own life and don’t worry about what you cant control. Live in tune with nature that is the best life you can live
  He keeps in mind that all rational things are related, and that to care for all human beings is part of being human – common theme of the interconnectedness of all things body mind soul and nature

    - **Note:** Focus on yourself not other internal locus of control. Don’t worry what other people think.
      Keep a focused and organized not chaotic mind. It’s easy to get lost in the sauce but harder to view things open honest and objectively. Keep a clean and focused mind negatives are detracting.
      Do what’s in your nature and live the life you’re supposed to live.
      We are all a connected system the body to itself to its community to the world.
      Think and focus on a few things that matter and you have agency over. Clear thinking. Sculpting thoughts.
      Don’t worry about others think clearly about important things do what is yours to do in your fate. Humans exist for each other in a connected system.
- 3.6
  Anything that might lead you astray, tempt you off the road, and leave you unable to devote yourself completely to achieving the goodness that is uniquely yours. It would be wrong for anything to stand between you and attaining goodness—as a rational being and a citizen. Anything at all: the applause of the crowd, high office, wealth, or self-indulgence. All of them might seem to be compatible with it—for a while. But suddenly they control us and sweep us away. So make your choice straightforwardly, once and for all, and stick to it. Choose what’s best. – make your life values clear and then live up to those everyday with those in mind look for internal success not external success. Do not chase things that are not in line with your desires because eventually you will be empty

    - **Note:** Do not chase externals live and create your own value system, and judge the success of your life based on how you conform to that
- 3.11
  Nothing is so conducive to spiritual growth as this capacity for logical and accurate analysis of everything that happens to us. To look at it in such a way that we understand what need it fulfills, and in what kind of world. And its value to that world as a whole and to man in particular – the best way to grow is to approach our experiences objectively without emotion. We need to view everything in the context of the system which it exists to truly understand why something happened and get to the root cause at that point we learn

    - **Note:** View everything that happens to us as logical and objective as possible. See incentives and the system not the world out to get you. If you remove yourself and emotion from the world and look objectively you can better understand the mysteries of the world. Perception vs interpretation
      Live with nature and control your thoughts. Approach the world objectively view the systems view not just your point view see the bigger picture and remain actively optimistic
      Make your life values clear and live up to them every day.
- Our inward power, when it obeys nature, reacts to events by accommodating itself to what it faces—to what is possible. It needs no specific material. It pursues its own aims as circumstances allow; it turns obstacles into fuel. – when we obey nature and remain flexible we are stronger and gain more leverage
  4.2
  No random actions, none not based on underlying principles. – always take a step back and understand if this action is true to you
    - **Tags:** #inner-strength, #agency-(figure-things-out), #thoughful-action, #grow-through-hardship, #power-of-the-mind, #mindfulness, #agency-(we-have-infinite-power)
    - **Note:** Pursue thoughtful action always. Our nature is successful when we adapt and accommodate to our environment and grow through hardship and trouble. We have the power within us to overcome any challenge. Take purposeful action unique to you and live within nature making obstacles the way.
- 4.3
  People try to get away from it all—to the country, to the beach, to the mountains. You always wish that you could too. Which is idiotic: you can get away from it anytime you like. By going within. – escape through meditation
  What’s there to complain about? People’s misbehavior? But take into consideration:
  • that rational beings exist for one another;
  • that doing what’s right sometimes requires patience;
  • that no one does the wrong thing deliberately;
  • and the number of people who have feuded and envied and hated and fought and died and been buried. . . . and keep your mouth shut. – you need to work to do what is right assume people are good and the cycle of hate never stops
  Or is it your reputation that’s bothering you? But look at how soon we’re all forgotten. The abyss of endless time that swallows it all. The emptiness of all those applauding hands. The people who praise us—how capricious they are, how arbitrary. And the tiny region in which it all takes place. The whole earth a point in space—and most of it uninhabited. How many people there will be to admire you, and who they are. – your reputation does not matter soon we will all be dead
  things have no hold on the soul. They stand there unmoving, outside it. Disturbance comes only from within—from our own perception – events do not effect you only your reaction to those events gives them agency to effect you
  everything you see will soon alter and cease to exist. Think of how many changes you’ve already seen. “The world is nothing but change. Our life is only perception.” – the world is always changing

    - **Note:** Escape by going within. Assume people are good we’ll all be dead soon so it doesn’t make sense to hate just forgive and enjoy life. Assume good intentions stop the hate cycle.
      Death comes for all don’t worry about surface level thin desires live the life you want don’t care what others think. External praise is empty.
      Inner monologue disturbances only come from within
      The world is always changing we must grow with it.
      Last 3 quotes are great reputation doesnt matter nothing has a hold on your soul its all perception everything is change

  reconsider your position, when someone can set you straight or convert you to his. But your conversion should always rest on a conviction that it’s right, or benefits others—nothing else. Not because it’s more appealing or more popular. – be willing to change your mind when you see you are wrong

  4.22
  Not to be driven this way and that, but always to behave with justice and see things as they are. – act justly at all times
  4.24
  “If you seek tranquility, do less” … Because most of what we say and do is not essential. If you can eliminate it, you’ll have more time, and more tranquility. Ask yourself at every moment, “Is this necessary?” But we need to eliminate unnecessary assumptions as well. To eliminate the unnecessary actions that follow. – cut out things that are non essential

  4.49
  So remember this principle when something threatens to cause you pain: the thing itself was no misfortune at all; to endure it and prevail is great good fortune. – you cannot avoid negative things but the ability to overcome negative events and prosper is a great thing

    - **Note:** Don’t sweat the small stuff.
      Perception and reaction gap. There are events that exists as events and then we give them meaning in our lives when we react to them. Negative things happen but we choose how they affect us and what comes of us. Overcoming trials is a great luxury
      perception vs interpretation grow through hardship is a great success
- 4.51
  Take the shortest route, the one that nature planned—to speak and act in the healthiest way. Do that, and be free of pain and stress, free of all calculation and pretension. – live a life as simple as possible but not any simpler

What do I have to complain of, if I’m going to do what I was born for— the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm? —But it’s nicer here. . . . So you were born to feel “nice”? – life is challenging find something that gets you out of bed in the morning

  Some people, when they do someone a favor, are always looking for a chance to call it in. And some aren’t, but they’re still aware of it—still regard it as a debt. But others don’t even do that. They’re like a vine that produces grapes without looking for anything in return.- don’t look for reciprocity
  5.8
  So there are two reasons to embrace what happens. One is that it’s happening to you. It was prescribed for you, and it pertains to you. The thread was spun long ago, by the oldest cause of all.
  The other reason is that what happens to an individual is a cause of well-being in what directs the world—of its wellbeing, its fulfillment, of its very existence, even. Because the whole is damaged if you cut away anything—anything at all —from its continuity and its coherence. Not only its parts, but its purposes. And that’s what you’re doing when you complain: hacking and destroying. – embrace what happens to you because there is nothing to do to change the past and complaining does not help anyone

Celebrate the little things and be happy for what you have

As if the things that irritate us lasted.– remember everything is eventually forgotten so do not hold grudges or worry about past things

'Let us set the axe to the root, that we being purged of our passions may have a peaceable mind.' To this end there must be continual self-examination.

In the morning purpose, in the evening discuss the manner, what thou hast been this day, in word, work, and thought.'
