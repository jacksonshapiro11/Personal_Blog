High leverage functions like deal desk legal team and collections deserve attention to optimize cash flow and trajectory. Specifically, understanding gross margin is crucial for determining operating margin and acquiring customers profitably is important for long-term success. Cash flow management is essential for business focus and success, and paying attention to collections can greatly improve cash flow. Additionally, high leverage functions like deal desk and legal teams can have a significant impact on overall business performance.
  2. In the discussion on the disruption of user interface and business model in sports marketing, it was noted that searching for desired content on the platform is frustrating due to excessive ads. The platform's business model pits customers against each other to increase revenue, although this negatively affects the user experience. However, a transaction model with fewer ads would be preferred by users, even though it wouldn't generate the same revenue per visit. This model could significantly reduce costs and improve the overall user experience. Furthermore, transactional integrations have the potential to result in a significant reduction (10x) in the amount customers are willing to pay.

  Speaker 1
  The, there's probably a few that are just like literally the underlying business model economics. I, like, I'm a big believer in gross margin. Your gross margin will ultimately determine your operating margin. There's almost no way that you can, you can kind of make those two, you know, kind of get out of sync. And so, if you're, if you're subsidizing something or, you know, or, or in just such a commodity business and you're, you know, 40, 50, 60% gross margin, like, there's just like no way You're going to have an operating margin that looks like a software company. Understanding your gross margin, managing to gross margin. I think it's super important. You know, all forms of LTV, CAC are probably good. I don't know what the latest, you know, make, you know, everybody. Every two years is a new term in the industry that is used, but like something that just shows that you can acquire a customer profitably and whether the payback is a year or two years or Three years almost doesn't matter as much as as do you know, ultimately generate a long, a long term, you know, sticky customer. I think cash flow is super important. I'm, I've, I've definitely like, I've gotten religion on cash flow. And I think companies getting the cash flow sooner is a, is a really good move. I think it pushes the business to be super focused. There was a lot of, again, kind of sloppiness around the edges that we had in our, in our hyper growth years that if we, if we maybe had had cash flow as a more top of my metric. We probably could have executed the same results, but around the margin, we would have been, you know, just doubling down the things that were working, the incremental international Region that was sort of like, you know, we were, you know, just betting on, we probably would have waited to invest in. And, and then ultimately again, you know, burn less cash gotten the same point. So I think cash flows is, you know, I definitely encourage founders to raise less than, than I would have five or 10 years ago and focus more on, on, you know, self, self sustaining, you Know, business models. The, the, the comment you made about earlier about managing your cash flow.

  And I presume the same, you're meeting the same thing on gross margin management. I've just found very few companies in the valley pay attention to this collections is another one that's in this area. So you, you know, you've come to be at 70, 80 million. And they don't have any good processes around collections. And so their DSOs are just slipping out. They could be way sooner and they're just not doing the work.
  Speaker 1
  I, I've been there. Like you guys should rally to get collections people to get paid way more or something. So like, like, just, there are some of these functions that are so high leverage that if you just nail it, you know, the, the deal desk legal team who's, who's negotiating the contract Terms. I mean, these things are like, they literally are trajectory defining in your cash flow. ([Time 0:13:43](https://share.snipd.com/snip/cd475084-3a7b-476e-a5c9-ed44803e7514))

  Cause there's four ads on top and four ads on the bottom. And you got to search through and find what you want. I'm a big sports fan. I often search for the roster of a team. That's not even at the top. It's like five links down. I have to find it and get around the ads. So it's like, so that's one, two. You already mentioned the business model. Their business model is to throw their customers in a cage match and let them compete with one other to the death. And, and, and that drove revenue sky high because it created Prado, like a super optimal payment. And no one wants to see four or five ads. You're not going to get to the same revenue per visit with a, with a transaction model that you do with the ad model because you already mentioned cactel TV. People will pay using marketing math 40, 50, 60% of first purchase with a transactional integration. They want to pay 5%. So you have a 10x reduction.
