### Highlights

- Picasso: A Self-Taught, Innovative Artist with a Knack for Selling
  Summary:
  Picasso was self-taught and self-promoted, without formal academic training, which allowed him to design his own curriculum and exploit his artistic ideas skillfully from a young age.
  He had a keen eye for the market and knew what would sell, enabling him to sell his paintings successfully throughout his life. Picasso's ability to learn to sell and build allowed him to thrive in his career.
  He experienced intense competition early on, prompting him to develop his unique style and seek less competitive avenues, recognizing that conventional painting wouldn't lead him to the top.

  He was essentially self taught, self directed, self promoted, emotionally educated in the teeming brothels of his city, a small but powerfully built monster of assured egoism. Now one of the benefits of being an auto diet act is the fact that everyone else is learning in tracks, right? They're just regurgitating what the formal education is telling them to do. Picasso designs his own curriculum that obviously has both benefits and weaknesses. He lacked the benefit, though also the inhibitions of full academic training. He was exceptionally skillful from an early age at exploiting his many and ingenious artistic ideas. He always kept a sharp eye on the market and always knew what would sell. He sold his paintings from the age of nine until he died. And though his output became and remained prodigious throughout his long life, he never had any difficulty in marketing. When I got to that part, it reminded me of one of my favorite lines in that fantastic book, the Almanac of Novall Ravakant, where Novall says this had a huge effect on me when I discovered It the first time, learn to sell, learn to build. If you could do both, you'll be unstoppable. David Ogilvy, a few weeks ago, expressed the same ideas in the vault. He called it killers and poets, though, that if you could be both a killer and a poet, you get rich. And so then there's a few important events that happen in the early life of Pablo Picasso. One, he experiences intense competition. This is going to lead him to develop his own style and then go to where there's less competition. Picasso seems to have grasped quite early on that he would not get to the top in the field of conventional painting.

    - **Note:** Learn to sell and learn to build. Picasso had a no traditional education and realized he couldn’t get to the top in traditional painting he needed to differentiate. He started selling his work at 9 years old. Imitation proceeds achievement Picasso copied this guy named casas but then realized he needed to get out of his shadow and moved to Paris. Align your goals and location. Picasso was a voracious creator making up to 1 painting a day. Intelligence manifests in different ways Picasso couldn’t write but expressed ideas through art. He was the richest artist ever when he died and made works that amounted to 1 a day fir 71 years. Power doesn’t curropt but it reveals Picasso revealed incredible selfishness. He had incredible charisma like history’s greatest founders. Arnold Steve Jobs. Picasso was evil he would beat women and steal peoples wives. He wanted to degrade everyone so he was on top. His greatness fueled his horrible feelings of superiority. He was super selfish and egotistic. He had everything but was far from happy many of the greats trade off personal life balance to be great and are very unhappy. His entire life really fell apart he sought to degrade to raise his status.
- Walt Disney's Main Inspiration and Childhood
  Summary:
  Walt Disney's main inspiration from childhood to his later life was nature, cultivated by his upbringing on a farm where he observed and drew animals.
  His father's demanding nature instilled in him the importance of family as the key to lasting happiness. Despite financial struggles, Disney developed a passion for entrepreneurship and autonomy, ultimately becoming a successful newspaper cartoonist by the age of 18.

  That is huge. This idea of Walt Disney's, I didn't, I didn't, and I've read three or four books on Walt Disney so far. And maybe I knew it at one point, but I feel like I never, maybe I knew it at one point forgot, but I feel like I never made the connection until Paul helped me put this idea in my mind. Or it's like his entire, his main inspiration was always from the very beginning from when he was a child to when he was, you know, on his death dying was nature. And so it says he grew up on a farm, delighted all of his life in observing and drawing animals. Their movements and idiosyncrasies gave him great pleasure where Picasso tended to dehumanize the women he drew a painted Disney anthropomorphized his animal subjects. That was the essential source of his power and humor. His family had little money and his father was demanding, but despite this, or perhaps because of it, Disney always saw the family as the essential unit in society and the only source Of lasting happiness. When the farm failed, the Disney's moved to Kansas City where his father started a newspaper dis distributing business and made Walt work very hard at all hours. By the age of 18, he was making his living as a newspaper cartoonist, but Walt developed two passions. First, he wanted to run his own business and be his own master. He had the American entrepreneurial spirit to an unusual degree. And so I want to pause there real quick. ([Time 0:22:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/16fc5522-7fb0-42a1-ab57-e2d79c623963))
    - **Note:** Disney grew up on a farm and sought to bring life to nature. He sought to humanize and revive animals bring life to the world. Walt had an entrepreneurial spirit turned up to the nth degree and his dad was ruthless in pushing and working him. He was obsessed with power and keeping control. He wanted agency in his life. His first company went bankrupt at 23. He had no money to eat and filmed funerals. He decided he had to go out to Cali to realize his dreams in Hollywood from kc but no one would even hire him. He made his first movie by hand because he had no one who could help and had no money to hire it. Had to figure it out made it fir $700 and sold for double. He had to be very careful about who you surround yourself with because they have a massive effect on your ability and output. He had a partner and he basically merged intellectually with him. After awhile Walt had to diversify his offering and moved on from just having Alice to a mouse named Oswald the issue was when he invented something other richer companies stole his idea and staff. Mickey Mouse was a character the product of admiration and love the 800k fan letters he received in 1933 are the most reciever ever by 1 person. His wife also got Walt to change the name from Mortimer to Mickey.
- The Origin of Mickey Mouse and the Power of Love in Branding
  Summary:
  The story behind Mickey Mouse's name change from Mortimer to Mickey reflects Walt Disney's decision to create a character animated by admiration and love, in contrast to Picasso's Cubist characters driven by contempt and hatred.
  Despite the initial choice of an evil character, Disney's creation of Mickey Mouse resulted in an outpouring of love and admiration, as evidenced by receiving over 800,000 fan letters in 1933. This demonstrates Disney's ability to make people, especially children, truly love his creations.
  The comparison between Picasso and Disney serves as a lesson in branding, emphasizing that while hate and negativity may grab temporary attention, a lasting and beloved brand can only be built on a foundation of love.

  Right? He chose Disney chose the name Mortimer Mouse, but his wife lily objected. And so that is when Disney picked the name Mickey. And why would Walt Disney 30 years later say, hope we never forget that it all started with a mouse another comparison of Picasso. Picasso had in fact turned the bodies and faces of his women models into characters, Cubist cartoon characters, animated awfully enough by contempt and even hatred. Right? She's like the evil version of Disney, but Disney produced a mouse animated by admiration and even by love. It is a significant that Mickey Mouse in the year of his greatest popularity, which is 1933 received over 800,000 fan letters, the largest ever recorded in show business at any time In any century. Think about that. An animated character received more fan letters than any other celebrity or known person in one period ever. There in late Disney's genius, he could make people, especially children, love his creations. And so what I would summarize, when he's trying to teach us about the difference between Picasso and Disney as this is love versus hate, you might get temporary attention by engaging In hate and negativity, but a durable, beloved brand can only be rooted in one thing and that is love.

    - **Note:** Picasso motivated through hate and Disney through love which is stronger but takes more time. He never wanted to make money he just loved cartoons. He had an insight that talkies movies with sound were the future. He moved fast and cheap because he had to. A lack of funding can be a feature not a bug of entrepreneurship. Disney invented the sound cartoon inventing a new field that was incredibly imaginative and revolutionary. His competition didn’t do what he was doing and Disney even used his own voice for Mickey at the beginning. He was constantly embracing new technology he was ruthless in embracing the future and technology like sound and then later color. He would study animals in depth and this is where much of his inspiration came from. Cross disciplinary. He spent money freely and did a ton of work on everything wanted it to be the best spending 6x more than his competition and only using the best never compromising to get the job done. Disney put excellence before any other consideration he never wanted to make money but something he was proud of. He hired the best and pushed them to their limits much like the premier studios of the 1700s history doesn’t repeat human nature does.
- The Long Journey to Snow White: Walt Disney's Vision for Human Animation
  Summary:
  Walt Disney had been preparing for human animation by holding live classes at his studio and waiting for technology to catch up.
  Snow White, released in 1938, was the result of over 18 years of his ideas and marked a significant advancement in the art of movie cartooning. The movie involved over two million drawings, making it the largest project in the history of draftsmanship.
  Snow White was a critical and commercial success, leading to the maturity of animation as an art form and becoming the most financially successful project for Disney at that time.

  The idea was Disney's of course, he had been preparing for human animation for some time by holding live classes at his studio. Wait for it, this is an end of life myself, wait for the technology to catch up. Ask yourself, what is possible today that I could not do a year ago? Start practicing that and wait for the technology to catch up. These ideas that are now accumulating Snow White comes out in 19, I think he starts working on 1934, comes out in 1938. He had been thinking about some of these ideas for over 18 years up until that point. He just again, I knew what I want to do. Can't figure out how to do it yet. And this is the result of a movie introduced numerous artistic and technical innovations that transform the art of movie cartooning. It involved over two million drawings and formed the largest single project in the history of draftsmanship that is insane, which had begun 40,000 years before in the caves of France And Spain. Again, that's why you got to love Paul Johnson. That's a very Paul Johnson that Paul Johnson might be the only person that ever read a sentence like that. It was a huge critical and commercial success and marked the point in which animation achieved maturity as an art form. He was the most financially successful thing I think he'd ever done by a long shot up until that point. But the crazy thing is I have another, I went through my read-wise and was searching for, I know Steve talked about Walt quite a bit. ([Time 0:43:18](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ff9c74bc-f473-4a1f-8021-7fe56cf6a9be))
    - **Note:** Disney was always thinking about future work that would be possible when the technology caught up then pounced once it did. Animating people like in Snow White was in his head for 18 years before it was finally able to be done. Ideas not technology transcends. VHS tapes have finite shelf lives but 60 years after it’s release Disney sold 28mm copies of snow while on dvd. Jobs studied Disney when at Pixar. Disneys next idea was bringing his ideas to the world through theme parks. The best ideas come much later in peoples career think Steve Jobs iPhone do you need to build and position for the long term. Knowledge compounds optimize for the long term and keep gaining incrementally. Disney lived within nature and that catalyzed his success while picssso fought it. Stoacism and living within nature.
