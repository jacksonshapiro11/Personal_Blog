### Highlights

- Episode AI notes
  1. Tim, an engineer at the Department of Defense, is a fantastic engineer with a love for business and a refreshing approach to life. He lives a modest lifestyle and is dedicated to writing code and working on Epic.
  2. Building modular game engines can save time and produce more content for game developers. Using primitives and modular building blocks allows for compounding value with each piece of work.
  3. There is tension between the developer-publisher model in the gaming industry. Epic Games had a conflict with Microsoft over the multiplayer-only version of Gears of War. The old model of game development is deemed ineffective.
  4. Epic Games launched their own store, the Epic Store, with a lower revenue cut and additional benefits for developers. They offer distribution, payment processing, and live operations for a maximum fee of twelve percent if the game is built on the Unreal Engine.

    - **Note:** Epic was built as this non linear multi act company where you can only connect the dots looking back. Tim starts out getting access to the early internet learning how to code then creates shareware he was always a fast follower to the market. He builds unreal as a platform and instead of extracting he tries to create more than he captures let 1mm flowers bloom. The benefit to modular building as they keep growing on itself and they just compounded their advantage too much fir anyone to catch up with the unreal engine.
      Benefits of modular building and positive sum thinking

  So his ad worked for the department of defense. He worked at the mapping agency as part of the intelligence unit, where they were creating military maps from satellite imagery, kind of doing a like palantier and sky box type stuff, Like way back in the day before those companies. So early on, young tim realizes two things about himself. One is that he loves tinkering with, like the guts of othings work, like, both mechanical and, as we will soon see, computers and technical things too. Is he also actually loves business. And this is a pretty rare combination. Like, he becomes a js fantastic engineer and a fantastic business mind. But he doesn't love business for the moneyn this is a man who really does not have a lot of use for money. He lives in north carolina. He's not married. He doesn't have kids. He doesn't hang out with celebrities. Ye. He's like, bought a few fancy sports cars and a nice house and stuff. But edew, he mostly talked about this to the wall street journal, he mostly eats bojangles fried chicken and drinks diet coke. He wears cargo pants that he probably buys for about twenty bucks. And what he does is, he basically writes code and a works on epic and that's what he cares about in life, which is, it's just so refreshing, like seeing that. And this man who's running such an important internect company, versus all the other larger than life texios out there. ([Time 0:09:09](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3e604db4-54f9-48e0-89d8-c6510b0e3687))
    - **Note:** Tim pretty much is a billionaire who likes coding wears cargo shorts and eats bojangles. Not a big money guy enjoys business from the engineering point of view. Tim was always a tinkerer with machines and was introduced to computers by his older brother when he was 11 and his brother was working at a computer start up and fell in love. He just programs for ever and has access to the early internet through his dad at the dod so he starts learning from people there. Starts programming then realizes when he’s salaried he can only make what he’s paid no matter what so he starts a business. Quits working for someone to work for himself. He then discovers making video games creates this thing called epic mega games selling shareware and hires a gift schooler to help code ends up making so much money he drops out of college as a junior.
- The Advantages of Building Modular Game Engines
  Key takeaways:
  - Each time a new game is made, a lot of previous work needs to be recreated
  - Building an engine similar to Doom's, but more extensible, allows for faster content creation
  - Using primitives and modular building blocks leads to compounding value
  - Building hype for a game can lead to incredible opportunities

  Speaker 2
  They're rewriting the wheel each time they come out with a new game. Like john did all this work to make doom work, but they have to recreate a whole lot of that each time they're making another game. So they have this lead, but it's not like they're going to keep just like, churning out game after game after game, and nobody else is going to catch up. I can take my time, build a engine similar to it, of what doom has, but if i make it a little more extensible, then i can use this engine and pump out a bunch of content internally, like and Not have to go through al these hoops each time. It is having to go through seems like, o k, cool. We're going to invest the time up front to do this.
  Speaker 1
  That parallel here is in sort of jeff bazo speak. It's a, tim is working on a system that uses primitives, building blocks, rather than sort of starting from zero each time. And because you sort of build from primitives and assemble building blocks that are sort of modular, and you can build on top of each time, you sort of get compounding value out of each Piece of work that you put in. Yes.
  Speaker 2
  So he starts working on it, and he's not shy about what he's doing. He's trying to build hipe for the game, for unrealies, talking to game magazines and the like. A pretty incredible thing happens. ([Time 0:30:36](https://share.snipd.com/snip/46b8942d-96b3-4966-b0e5-75be4861067a))
    - **Note:** Doom is seen as this massive feat first 3D game with no graphics cards just carmack wizardry. ID literally built a new engine every time they released a game which would be state of the art. Epic decides to build a modular engine that can be upgraded instead of the rebuild every time. This leads to a ton of inbound from other developers asking them to liscense the engine so they do. Epic built this engine at the perfect time it enabled creatives to make games as the technical bar had gotten away from the average dev because it got too computationally complex. Then Microsoft came our with the Xbox this allows then to build out the engine for Xbox and PlayStation which saved a ton of dev time and this firmed their place as a premier tech company who didn’t really do games anymore.
- Tension between the developer publisher model
  Key takeaways:
  - The tension between the developer-publisher model is discussed.
  - The developer is seen as the creative force while the publisher is the investor.
  - Epic wanted to create a multiplayer-only version of Gears of War but Microsoft disagreed.
  - The old model of game development was deemed ineffective.
  - Two important events in 2009 laid the groundwork for Epic Games today: the discussion of a new model and the launch of a game by a startup company.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Also, i started to show the tension between this sort of a developer publisher model. For folks who haven't listened to the e a episode or where else, we talked about this on the activision blizzard episode. You know, the developer is the creative it's almost like thing about it, thats the director on down on a movie set, where your you're the one sort of having the brilliant ideas and executing On them. And the publisher is the investor. They're sort of fronting the money. They're doing the marketing. They know how to businessfy your creative efforts. And so the issue is, when push comes to shove, like it did with, what was it, years of war, i think, after maybe years of war, three epic wanted to do a multiplayer only version. They said, look, we think multiplayer gaming is the future. Intent, you knoware nudge nudged to where they are to day. And on line s, you know, right arond the corner started to become a thing, and so and minason walake, no, we don't care.
  Speaker 2
  We won't have o move more at three sixties, exactly.
  Speaker 1
  And so it was basically a stale mate at that point. And microso was the publisher, mike microso was the money behind it. And so, you know, they won.
  Speaker 2
  So we're now right around like, two thousand nine, two thousand ten time frame. And tim has a quote. He says, there was an increasing realization that the old model wasn't working any more, and the new model was looking increasingly like the way to go. So what is the new model? So two things happen right around this time that totally lay the groundwork for what epoc is to day. The first is, in october two thousand nine, a little company in lawill start up in la, launches a game, if you could call it that. ([Time 0:44:14](https://share.snipd.com/snip/02bc3719-5758-4859-8c1c-6b17ace35020))
    - **Note:** Developers are the artists but the publishers do the marketing and funding. Epic wants to make a multiplayer online game but Microsoft their publisher shoots them down. Epic had made gears of war which was a massive success but the economics on other games was weak. They needed to evolve. League of leg ends creates the paradigm of free to play where you can buy only aesthetics not mods. And takes off. Epic sees this that games are becoming like saas tools and they become a distributor to port games into other systems as well as accept payments. Strategic refocus of the company. Also sells 40% of business at 1b. Valuations. Company refocus. They divested existing games like gears or war and made the unreal engine free to liscense and charged 5% royalties smaller piece of bigger pie symbiotic relationship much more expensive to build in house. They had been building fortnite since 2012 but then they saw this other game and their history was always as optimizing a fast follower and they adapted fortnite for this battle royale and it exploded. They raised money had traditionally been lean wanted to spend it kinda wasted it then found this honey pot.
- The Epic Store's Competitive Strategy and Revenue Cut
  Key takeaways:
  - Valve has a monopoly on many games and takes a cut of their revenue
  - Epic launched their store with a lower cut than Valve
  - If you build your game on the Unreal Engine, the revenue fee is included in the twelve percent cut
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And frankly, the knock on valve is, those guys haven't had a hittin for ever. They're just taking a vig or a rake on all these other games that they basely have a monopoly on, piecy game distribution, youpland they're taking a thirty per cent cut an epic had such A hit with fortnight where they were like, a we'e had the advantage of never needing to be in your store and always going direct. So now we have this direct channel to all these customers, like we should leverage that, youow.
  Speaker 2
  So what do they launch the store with, they launch the store with a twelve per cent cut of revenue. So they undercut valve by eighteen per cent. And then the kicker is, if you build your game on the unreal engine, the five per cent revenue fee gets baked into the twelve per cent. So they're realliterally unreal saying, you get the engine, you get the live ops, you get the distribution in the store and the payment processing that comes with that for a maximum Fee of twelve per cent of your revenue.

    - **Note:** They come out with this epic store that instead of exploiting and double charging takes 5% over what they need to run the store. Fair not exploitive unlike other people in the industry. Fortnite as a generational success gives them room to run. Apple takes fortnite off the Apple store and threatens to take off every game using the unreal engine because fortnite tried to go direct to customers through their device and this goes to the courts. Tim sees the future not as closed ecosystems but an emergent metaverse he wants to have a small piece of unlike Apple. He sees the future as owned by no one and open to everyone very ready player 1. Low or zero marginal cost goods make for incredible bueiness of operating leverage. Zero marginal cost and let 1000 flowers bloom. Watch for publisher relationships powers. Technology compounds everything compounds. Iterating and building every day.
