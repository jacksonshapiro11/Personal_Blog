### Highlights

- Respect Over Rewards: The Essence of True Incentive
  Summary:
  Success amnesia, the tendency to overlook past achievements, highlights the need for balance between humility and recognition of accomplishments in organizational culture.
  Incentivizing people goes beyond financial compensation; it involves fostering an environment where respect and genuine connection thrive. Earning respect comes from engagement and support, rather than mere transactional interactions.
  Leaders should show respect by giving challenging responsibilities, as this empowers individuals and affirms their worth.
  The true measure of value in relationships and workplace dynamics lies in time spent and shared objectives.
  Meaningful friendships, built on shared values and experiences, enrich personal and professional lives. Ultimately, respect and attention are underestimated in organizations, yet they are crucial for motivation and growth.

  Speaker 2
  And also, he brought up this idea and we're curious because this definitely comes up, I think, with Sequoia when you talk about culture at Sequoia. But this concept of success amnesia, how you balance, okay, we are good, we've done good things, we've created value, we've made great investments. We're not going to just be grounded in complete humility per se, where the humility shows up. It's just that you just discount everything that's been done in the past, as if it just doesn't matter. As if today really is day one, it sounds very similar to how you're describing KKR.
  Speaker 1
  I think people when they hear, know you understand this very deeply, but I think people when they hear it's about how you incentivize people, they automatically go to it's how much you Pay and how you pay. And I actually think it's like a very narrow understanding. So one of the things I think that KKR did extremely well, and what you just said, Rick, made me think about it, because you're right, it is about the incentives, but it's not... It's not the incentives per se. One of the incentives for being entrepreneurial at KKR was that Henry and George would like you better and they would spend time with you. Not because they would do it on purpose, but they just gravitated towards that. One of the things you would notice is that Scott was in Henry's office a lot or on the phone with George a lot, even when he had to do the same title as other people. And sometimes they'd refer to him, yeah, I was talking to Scott. And you could just tell that they respected him. You know what I'm saying? And I think that when people talk about incentives, I think they undervalue the thing we all want, which is respect. We want to earn respect from people we care about, and we want to respect ourselves. But I think that one of the things that you can't fake is, do you respect somebody? Do you care to spend time with them? Do you choose in your discretionary time to go and seek them out? Do you walk over to their desk and say, hey, what do you think about this? So much of the value later when I got to experience being a leader is that I find that people care about is just like asking them what they think and actually caring. Do I incentivize to care what you think? It's like, you have to be good. You have to actually have an opinion that I want to hear.
  Speaker 3
  That reminds me of one of your writings on hiring, the hiring why more is often less. You have a bunch of ideas in there around this form of respect actually is giving those people the hardest, most important projects too. So yeah, you show respect, but by the way you do that is to give them as many people as they can handle and the hardest projects because that's actually how they're going to get ahead and They're going to make the most money and have the most leadership or responsibility.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, you want to know that you respect them enough to give them responsibility, but I think that's something because Henry and George never left the field, they would be out there talking To people and if you were interesting, they would want to spend time with you. And I think that's independent. People talk about skip level. There was so many levels below Henry and George when I was at KKR. And I didn't work for them. I worked for people who worked for people who worked for people who worked for them. Yet they both made time for me. How cool is that? That's like a five skip level thing.
  Speaker 2
  It actually makes me think about some of your writings on friendship as well, because when you get into incentives, it's not just that George and Henry were carving up their time coldly And saying, we're going to dole out our time. It's actually, if you step back and see in your blog post on it, you referenced The Inner Ring by C.S. Lewis, who's one of my favorite authors. But he basically talks about the whole book is broken down into four sections on what he categorizes as four forms of love, affection, eros, friendship, and agape. And agape deals with the sort of the love with higher power, and he distinguishes between these loves, and they're quite different. Some of them are jealous loves. Others, like friendship, actually get better with more. And I think this is where I was leading me to, you had written, you said, if a friend is spending time with you, it's because they want to do it. There is something special about this, particularly at this point in my life when I and many of my friends have young children. The opportunity cost of time with friends has never been higher. I'm grateful that my friends choose to spend time with me, but as I reflect, it's not just gratitude, it's pride. I am proud that these people enjoy our time together, enough to spend their limited free time with me. And I imagine that's very similar to how somebody would feel if George and Henry wanted to grab a coffee with you. But the point to me is actually that where Lewis roots friendship definitionally is that you see aspects of the world the same way, that you share the same values, that you care about The same things. It's not the love my wife and I have. It's we love one another. We're like looking at each other and we love one another. The love of friends is not looking at each other, it's looking out. And so there's plenty of room for there to be other people. But if somebody's really entrepreneurial and has lived a life that likes to embed those risks and take those chances and stuff, they're going to seek that out in their friends. They're going to want to attract folks who also have that same disposition, if you will. And so I really like you reframing incentives because, yes, absolutely, most of the time, people talk about incentives, they go right to how somebody compensated. And actually, for most of us, most of the time, it's not the thing. It might be the thing for a little bit, but it becomes not the thing very quickly.
  Speaker 1
  It's a hygiene factor. You want it to be fair, and you want to buy stuff for sure, but it's not enough. It does not last forever. That is not enough, at least for most of us. And I think what you just said of the reasons that we find friendship, I really did. To this day, I was walking the other day, our offices, the Sequoia offices are in the same building as KKR, which is so funny. People in New York are always like, Oh, that's not that interesting. No, no, it is interesting. There's only two tenants in our office building. The idea that one of them is KKR, one of them is Sequoia. That is weird. That's interesting. But I was going for a walk there day, I had my AirPods in, and I was just like walking on Sand Hill Road. And then this older gentleman, I was like, in my own world, walking. Then this person stops and is looking at me and I come to attention and it's George and I'm like, Oh shit. And I'm like, Hey, I immediately take out the AirPods. It's still like full, like boss mode. Of course, take out the AirPods and how are you? And he was walking. And I just was like, can I walk with you to the office? I was like, where are you going? He's like, I'm walking. He walks from his house some number of days to the office. He's like, yeah, of course. And I just got 25... ([Time 0:35:34](https://share.snipd.com/snip/06430a9d-fab3-4c8b-8f5f-a1b5729474de))
    - **Note:** Incentives and friendship. incentives don’t have to be money. They can be entertainment and focus and respect and love. friendship as the highest love. Friendship is seeing the world the same way. people truly care about you and you truly care about them. that’s the only way to have a relationship that matters not around power dynamics around love
- Understand Individuals to Foster Team Success
  Summary:
  Team success hinges on understanding individual motivations, which vary from person to person.
  Whether it's ambition for greatness, financial gain, or a desire to prove oneself, recognizing these unique motivators is crucial. Effective leaders must appreciate the transient nature of these desires and focus on building a shared purpose that aligns with the team's goals.
  Investing time in understanding the human condition enables leaders to foster an environment where team members flourish.
  The ability to convey genuine care for individuals fosters trust and followership, distinguishing great leaders from mere task managers.
  These leaders prioritize individual needs while aligning them with organizational success, demonstrating that a strong personal connection leads to increased motivation and team cohesion. Emphasizing empathy and understanding creates a culture of collaboration, allowing leaders to inspire and challenge team members effectively.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And at some point, the expected value of one thing is greater than the expected value of the other thing. And if it's just money, then there's only certain things that you definitely will do. Yeah, I agree with you though, Paul. I like the way you said it. If we're going to make the team win, there are different moments where different things are going to be the motivator. And it's also different for each person, right? Somebody might be motivated by trying to be great. Somebody at that point might be motivated by trying to make a lot of money. Somebody might be motivated by trying to prove that they not a failure because their last one didn't work. I actually think it's person by person and then creating that in terms of a shared purpose of like, wherever your individual motivation is, the only way we accomplish that is if the team Wins. That I think is a cool wrapping.
  Speaker 2
  Going back to these great coaches, none of them treat every player the same. So much of the job is being able to understand what that individual needs, what that individual is fueled by at the time. And like you said, it's ephemeral. But I think for me, I think this is where studying the human condition becomes so important for leaders. What does it mean to be human? What do we actually need? We have these basic needs and we have these basic desires, but ultimately, I think there are these really enduring forces. I remember hearing Oprah Winfrey explain why she's been able to get so many people to confess to her climbs and all kinds of things. And she basically said, it's because I believe that everybody wants to understand and be understood. Just the power of being understood is such a huge motivator. The other side of that is just the desire to understand the world around us more and understand other people, to build our knowledge base. It's why you have to invest so much time in people around you because it's not easy oftentimes to understand what somebody is looking for and how to get the most out of them and how to help Them to flourish. But I imagine stepping into that role at Instacart, there is this sense that this is why we're always pushing our students to get operating roles as early as possible. And even if they want to become an investor eventually, is go get into the scrum, get into the mix, understand what it takes to build company, but understand what it takes to marshal other People with got got a great idea, great. How do you communicate it so that you give other people on board?
  Speaker 1
  I think Jamie Dimon has this quote that I heard one time that he had said, which was like, theory and practice are the same. In practice, they couldn't be more different. And I think that that is, I think, a pretty good distillation. And the other thing I was thinking about on your people stuff, listen, like one of the best leaders I've ever met is the CEO of Instacart, Fiji Simo. She's an amazing leader. And one thing about her is, look, she cares deeply about the company succeeding deeply. But she still cares about the people enough where if there is something that is good for them, she still is able to separate herself and talk to them about what's good for them. People aren't vessels by which she can accomplish her goals. She is able to actually care more about the person than about her particular goal. And the crazy thing is in the long term, it creates more followership, more motivation, more all that, but she genuinely cares about the person. I aspire to be that way. I hope I'm that way. But seeing somebody be that way, even in moments of real stress, is awesome. It is awesome. And I think that the best leaders earn followership. And that's what she does. And I think that what you just said, though, about people can feel if you just view them as a vessel by which your goals can get achieved versus, no, I actually care about you. I care about your goals. I want you to do this. Now, hopefully we can do it together as it's here, but if not, what matters most is that I do care about you. And that also allows you to be demanding of people because they know you actually care. ([Time 0:54:21](https://share.snipd.com/snip/bb1106c6-cad1-4e81-b190-f9e870ffcc35))
    - **Note:** Humans want to understand and be understood. care about others to earn their respect and following. everyone wants to talk about themselves. You just have to be willing to listen.
- Seek the Surprising Inevitable
  Summary:
  Identifying compelling future opportunities requires keen listening to founders who articulate visions that feel both early and inevitable.
  Emphasizing the importance of surprising insights, one should seek statements that provoke curiosity and compel engagement. The core of assessing potential lies in recognizing trends that will manifest with or without one's involvement, allowing for the possibility of accelerating those trends.
  Real-world feedback, particularly strong customer loyalty, reinforces the inevitability of these trends beyond mere satisfaction metrics.
  Additionally, the commitment to engaging with founders at any moment is pivotal, highlighting the importance of relational support throughout the entrepreneurial journey.
  Combining these factors—an understanding of emerging inevitabilities and a willingness to contribute support—forms a sound strategy for recognizing and pursuing worthwhile investments in innovation.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  That's why I laugh and see the future. I definitely do not know how to see the future in any form or fashion. Even the Matt Kohler version of this of jobs, not to see the future, but see the present very clearly. I don't even know if I do that well. I think what I try to do is when I meet with somebody, I try to really listen to what they're telling me about how world is going to be different. And I try to see if what they say as the founder resonates with me or almost better than resonates, like takes me aback. Well, wait a second. What did you just say? And I got this piece of advice early onwards. There should be something you hear where you almost can't believe what you just heard. Get curious. What did you say? Why did you say that? How confident are you in that? And so what I'm looking for in a meeting with a founder is for them to describe some future that is compelling, inevitable, and we're like early in the journey. So I always talk about I'm looking for things that are early and inevitable. But ideally, it's like surprising that they're inevitable. You know what I'm saying? Like you haven't thought about it yet. Oh, my gosh. Oh, wow. Wow, that could be that is going to happen. And the reason I think that matters, it's very hard to just conjure something into being. I think you can accelerate it. But ideally, the thing you're describing will happen with or without you. It's like something in the world that's going to happen with or without you. Maybe you can make it happen five or 10 years earlier. Maybe you can be the one that captures the rewards from doing it. But ideally, it's not the inevitable is important to me. Oh, this is the way the world is going to work. The reason I start with that is I want a founder to have seen what the world is going to be like. And then I want them to tell me what it's going to be like. And then I want to believe them. That is super different to me than I'm going to figure it out myself and then look for somebody who's doing it. That is not how it works for me. I then combine that with the idea of the future is here. It's just not evenly distributed. Even when I went to Instacart, when I asked Avne, we used it a lot when I asked her, what do you think of this? And she said, I love it so much. If you wanted to move, I wouldn't move unless Instacart delivered to the new house. That felt like damn, that is incredible customer love. And it did feel inevitable that people would buy more groceries online in the future than they'd bought home. Like felt like that was something that was going to happen. And then you combine that with the real life feedback. That's not like an NPS score. That's not like a 70 NPS, even though that's great. That's like, I can't live without this. So you combine it with early and inevitable, combine with some customer perspective, some number, some thing that's just, oh my gosh, come on, I think then it becomes very, these things Are true. I just named some pretty art things, right? That's not a ton of science yet. And I would say the next one's also art. How will I feel if this founder calls me at 1030 at night? Because if I take back this idea of a lot of the value that you provide as being available to somebody and willing to tell them the truth and willing be there for them, you got to want to talk To them at any time. And even if that's an inconvenient time or anything, you got to want to talk to them. You're signing up for a really long journey. And in my heart, I don't think this is incongruent. I believe that 99.9999% of the credit goes to the founder and the management teams that build these companies. And I think it's valuable to be available for them when they want to talk. You know what I'm saying? I don't care what percentage of value it creates. I just think it is useful. Have somebody who wants to talk to you or help you. And so I think the combination of early and inevitable, something that makes me blows my hair back, metric number, customer testimony, something, combined with, do I want to pick up The phone? How do I feel? Patrick calls this the green button test. Those are things that I look for. And I'll tell you now if I bring it back to Sequoia, what's interesting there is we're a very written culture. I have an extremely hard time writing memos on companies that I'm not super excited to invest in. And I actually find it very easy to write portions of a memo when I'm really excited about it. ([Time 1:14:23](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2c5eff18-1446-4a08-837c-8b40f5af43a1))
    - **Note:** See the future and live in it. create your idea in the future and then build for that. What does your future look like? Early and inevitable.
- Cultivating Joy Fuels Success
  Summary:
  Joy is a crucial element in any environment, particularly in workspaces, where individuals should feel more fulfilled at the end of the day than when they arrived.
  This sense of joy contributes to a positive culture, vital for the sustained success of teams. Effective cultures, such as those seen in sports, blend support with high expectations, creating a powerful, multiplicative effect on morale.
  Joy signifies underlying positive outcomes and becomes even more essential in challenging professions like investing, where setbacks are common.
  Support and love within teams provide individuals with the motivation to strive for excellence, and nurturing this duality fosters growth.
  Furthermore, leaving a place better than one found it encourages a legacy of humility and accountability, critical for maintaining high standards and ongoing success. It's about proactive engagement rather than defensiveness; a culture must focus on advancing rather than merely protecting past achievements.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  What am I doing? Why am I doing it? And I think if it didn't have joy and I didn't bring joy, I'd feel a lot less good about any moment I'm away from them.
  Speaker 2
  The context that we place around joy and why it matters so much is really comes to the tea. Because in the end, to be able to perpetuate anything, people have to be loving it. And they have to be feeling like they're not coming to an office and getting emptied and going home empty. They need to feel like they're coming home at the end of the day more full than when they showed up. It's very hard to do, but I think it's extremely powerful. So many of these, I think these great cultures, whether it's in sports, and I'll have to tune in to all the good stuff you guys have coming down the pipeline with Glue Guys, but like these Truly great teams, they seem to be the programs seem to have these incredible alchemies behind their culture. These things that we've touched on it a bit, just talking about supportive and demanding, wait a second, aren't those the opposite? Things that people feel like should not go together, but somehow when you combine them, it leads to this multiplicative effect. And so I think that when we look at the sort of inherent latency that's in something like inequality, like joy, it's good for everybody. It's generally, I think, a signal of other good things. People are not joyful when they're losing. And yet it can also be something where, like you touched on earlier, I mean, investing is one of those professions where you're going to lose a lot. The micro, things are not going to always go your way. You need something to fall back. You need something else other than just, well, you better do better next time. You need to know that you're loved. You need to know that you're supported and ultimately brings it to this higher purpose. And again, these firms that can demonstrate through multiple generations that it is really more. Yes, of course, there's people in, you cannot talk about Sequoia without talking about a long list of extraordinary individuals, but it just seems critical to the story is that somehow Those individuals write themselves out of the script.
  Speaker 1
  I could not agree with you more. And then they also, the thing they do, which is really great when I started when Jim gets sits with you and it's sort of like, look, all you got to do is leave it better than you found it. That's very intimidating. You found it pretty good. And when Rulof says that and you see people that are working like they are 20, 25, even more than that year is in, I think that it's actually quite valuable to tell someone leave it better Than you found it because that's what each of them did. And that sets a standard, but it also makes sure that, look, you have to be real. I don't deserve any credit for the history Sequoia had before I got here. Like zero. This firm was amazing before I got here. And there's humility in that. And then you don't want to be the generation that screws it up. But I think making sure you're not the generation that screws it up, you got to make sure you're on offense rather than protecting. And I think Doug was always really good about reminding us that there's no protecting. When you're in the prevent defense, you lose. You got to go play off.
