### Highlights

- Gain awareness and question your beliefs. Update your beliefs and check in with what your beliefs even are. We’re all high rung and low rung thinkers so understand why you’re high rung and avoid your long rung. Understand others beliefs and steelman them. Think small about a person at the individual level and big about the cosmic level. Appreciate and respect people on a human LEVEL Accept you’re only human. Where all high and low in different areas. Everyone is flawed so get many perspectives and climb the ladder up and down. Develop courage to say what you believe. The

    - **Note:** Become aware of our beliefs and fallibility have patience with ourselves and others and seek to understand not to win
- Criticism enhances ideas while cancel culture shuts people down. We should not tolerate the intolerant. Those who use their fists and power instead of rational argument in the market place for ideas.
    - **Tags:** #genie-vs-gollum, #critical-approach-(conjectures-and-refutations), #open-minded
    - **Note:** Practice critical approach and be open minded. Genie vs gollum.
- Curriculum is changing ti get rid of teaching certain subjects that hurts all students and all victims of uncomfortable crimes that aren’t taught. Not only do candidates need an equity justification but whole roles do too. This has also been lead by the rise in administration which gets paid to say and move not do. The first filter in hiring is a diversity statement for schools so if you don’t promote equity your research doesn’t matter. Upfront discrimination based on views. It’s important to hear views you disagree with liberal arts schools are supposed to teach you how to think. Colleges are getting away from that but they’re a regulated monopoly Social media dragging people through the mud is fun so the barrier to do it gets lower next thing you know you’ve fostered a toxic community movement. Smear and then other that person. Pushing someone out cements their status and google keeps the accusations forever no matter how true guilt is assumed. Speaking truth to power vs creating a beat down randomly. Not only would a person be marked for their views but all their associates and if you even go on their podcast etc. would fall under the rage of the mob The sjf mob clamors for punishment and we eventually are the victims when that punishment is carried out because it squashes speech.

    - **Note:** The sjf narrative is restricting speech in schools by creating ok and not ok views to hold. This filters based on race and equity leading to a one sided discussion with the other side being evil. Guilt is assumed and views are limited to the accepted ones. This is blatant post modern toxic and zealot like community beliefs and this is done by the education system which is a regulated monopoly
- The idea of idea socialism vs idea supremecy. Honor culture is old west values defend your honor with a gun. Dignity culture is self confidence to shrug off affront from others no need to outwardly defend your honor but just know who you are and not let others effect you. This is you deal with the problem if it reaches a threshold but otherwise move on and ignore it. Victim culture is honor culture but inverted yiu take pride in being discriminated against and take pride in your victim nature you don’t wait to act but act immediately with low sensitivity to action and the only difference is you go right to an authority figure and finger point instead of western justice. They let ideas creep into worse ideas concept creep the idea of pushing the Overton window vs viewing words as violence. Sjf rejects conjecture and criticism all ideas have proponents skeptics and undecided then there are profiteers who align with status not ideas. This comes a power games competition. There is a lot of homogeneity in college campuses. And this has increased rapidly. The other view isn’t represented and it’s resisted by others so it becomes belief over truth. The idea of idea supremecy is Bourne out when speakers are cancelled when they visit by students. There have been many Influental people either disinvited or shouted down and basically philabustered the same thing republicans did in the 60s. Speech is being restricted under the guise of equity. But this is bad for the free speech cultured Issues is not just that freedom is restricted but many ideas are not tried. Sjf journals are rejecting ideas they disagree with with good science and rejecting bad science with good conclusions.

    - **Note:** Honor culture is western justice defending yourself with a gun
      Dignity culture is transcending barbs from others and having self confidence to brush them off. Create an intervention threshold and if its below that ignore it and if its above that address it and solve the issue
      Victim culture is taking pride in being thought of as being hurt or a victim this is status lifting. This is the inversion of honor culture and leads to concept creep where the Overton window continues to shift. This culture has been perpetuated at college campuses with homogeneous cultures that create a self reinforcing feedback loop where only one side of the argument is ever heard and the other side just becomes more vilified.
      Diversity of viewpoints and reasonable sensitivity to action.
      Idea socialism welcome all ideas vs idea supremacy only one idea is right
      Victim culture is honor culture but ceeding agency to an authority
- When you limit the viewpoints that others can hold people start to think that their viewpoints aren’t widely held and so a culture that is diverse in thought can become one that is very rigid because no one speaks out of fear if ever on spoke out and they would realize they were all on the same side but because that’s restricted no one speaks out then people start believing it and then it gets passed down throughout the years and I believe that wasn’t widely held because of some restrictive group censoring people and censoring discourse leads to a belief that is widely held because it’s all people think and talk about it Free speech allows ideas to work its way through society and for the Overton window to shift. With out a free market for ideas people are left scared and guessing. People who don’t feel safe to speak their minds is bad for society. All views are welcome originally in 1958 interracial marriage had a 4% approval rating now it has a 94% that’s what a free market place of ideas does. Allows debate to move toward truth. The same happened with smoking. Create idea lab culture play by high rung rules. Gollums are threatening the human collective brain.

    - **Note:** A Vibrant ideas market is vital to progress in society . When there is a suppression of ideas minority ideas with loud group think can take hold but if people are able to speak out and debate then the true feelings can come through and progress can be made because there are more open and honest conversations. Cultivate high rung idea lab cultures
      Create a culture for open and honest debate don’t hide discourse
- Post modernists - see the entire world as false meta narratives and the radical social justice movement is the next stage of communism except identity is the replacement for class struggle. They believe all forms of truth are subjective and there is no objective truth vs the idea of having objective truth it just being different for different people Social justice fundamentalism the intersection of post modernism and communism infused with social justice. Instead of rejecting all narratives this complete embraces the sjf narrative while rejecting all else. They see the world as founded by racism and fit everything into this meta narrative. The world is bigoted and only designed for white men. This is in every institution and even our science. Liberal ideology sees people through a mosaic of diversity from education to experiences family ect. Sjf just sees identity and power. They see this power as the force of humanity. The issue with sjf is not that it’s very left but that they treat their beliefs as axioms and reject all else making them low rung which is the issue. Instead of saying did racism occur they understand racism always occurs and ask how did it occur. Starting with the answer then working backwards. Sjf assumes that if people of color disagree with them they are brainwashed and that non disadvantaged people don’t deserve an opinion. Everyone deserves a viewpoint who agrees with them everyone who disagrees or isn’t a correct group has nothing ti contribute. Invalidates the idea that people can have empathy for other experiences that they themselves haven’t lived through. Further when Peter theil supported trump as a gay man people said he was someone who had sex with men but wasn’t gay because he didn’t accept the worldview of gay people. To be sjf you must accept the world view fully. A persons moral integrity is how they deal with people they can’t stand

    - **Note:** The idea of the liberal vs the SJF zealot ideology. The SJFs are a radical group that distill what to think to core unchanging principals and bend reality when their perception doesn't accord to it like with Theil or race. They think everything is wrong and reject everything but accept their core beliefs. They're just backwards because they don't embrace nuance and reality. They start with their preferred world view and adjust the world to get there
- Republican fundamentalists started slow with a Goldwater president run and slowly as the party aligned more right they took control. They were more concerned with changing the rules. Opting for yelling and censorship of others instead of promoting discourse. They changed the rules to the low rung. Legal cheating. When you break the spirit of the law you don’t do anything wrong but you destroy the system. Prisoner’s dilemma where choosing defect seems good but long run is bad. The rise of low rung thinking on the right.

    - **Note:** The republican fundamentalists sought to crush the discourse and create an eco chamber this lead to the slow creep of low rung thinking which spiraled out of control. Instead of seeking truth and being open and honest they wanted to be right and win and this lead to perverse incentives which have caused bad knock on effects.
      Rule beating in systems breaks systems
- Distributed factions hurt rivalry. Because there is less of a them vs us because there’s a mosaic of that within each them and us. Having a bigger then can unite people that hate each other. Parties lost the user and instead of being split ideologically started to realign to be more homogeneous with Barry Goldwater turning southern dems into Republican and the extreme republicans moved dem because the racists moved the other way in this the parties had to market to extremes and started being defined by them. Distributed vs concentrated tribalism to hyper tribalism. In factioning off the tribes became more not less extreme. And this creates a feedback loop to appeal to the hardliners. This got super charges by the increased movement of people leading to hyper segregation. All it takes is a little bit of bias at the individual level to create large collective bias. People want to be near others like them and as politics has gotten more divided the people like them tended to sway the same political side too. When you spend time around people who you agree with you your views become more entrenched. Further the rise of technology has led to Fox and CNBC which narrowcast so technology in the past which had a broader audience can now target Politics has become not a treat seeking show but a reality show where the politicians are the subjects Algorithms have only super charged political division showing people what they want to see. As a result people feel they are being portrayed incorrectly. 75% of people believe the bias is to the other side and what they aim to draw out is discussed of the other side as this is one of the most violent emotions There is a ton of tribalism in politics where almost half of dems and republicans wouldn’t marry someone from the other party up from 5% 50 years ago. Also correlation on voting tickets between congress and president elections went from .54 to .97. Political bigotry.

    - **Note:** People split into more concentrated factions which’s leads to more ability for us vs them. This is the radicalization. Loop where you keep separating then getting more extreme lose touch fall into echo chambers and get More extreme. Good old doom loop
- Disney movies show clear good and evil and people see the world as black and white but the world is really grey and we must think that way if we are to improve our thinking. At the high rung there is complexity and messiness in which we debate structure and steel man our side creating and honest market for ideas on the low end we’re just running around with our hair on fire calling things good and bad. People like a political Disney world because their views are easy to digest and clear basically a hack on what to believe without thinking. Gollums don’t hear the other side and when they do it’s a straw man argument. Anecdote vs trend tendency. When something is in our favor we show it as a trend and when it’s not we say it’s a one off. When a politician we like gets caught in a scandal Aw say family man caught in bad situations but when it’s against us we say dishonest politicians continues to lie to voters and family. High rung shared reality low rung living in 2 different worlds. These use straw man and conformation bias. Gollum sees zero sun power games.

    - **Note:** We have created this idea of a political disney world where right and wrong are clear and we don't need to debate because it's so obvious. This creates low rung thinking because the world is very complex and these are just strawmen that hack into our innate human nature. This is an answer without thinking. We need to create an honest market for ideas.
      High rung shared reality low rung living in 2 different worlds. Our world of irreducible complexity cannot be over simplified and we want to do this and feel good but we can’t. Anecdote vs trend tendency
- Human nature + environment = behavior. Liberal - commitment to individual freedom and the prerequisites to attaining that freedom a market economy religious tolerance a government constrained by law and legitimated by popular consent Liberal rules anyone can do whatever they want as long as it doesn’t harm others and the governments job is to prevent harm. Freedom safety and equal opportunity are your rights. Power games is about force liberal games is about persuading and logic. This means those who provide the most value get rewarded by either customers or voters. Freedom or speech creates a marketplace for ideas.

    - **Note:** Liberals protect free speech and agency while the power games seek to corner these two areas. Liberal games are positive sum knowledge growing enterprises while power games walk the party line. Liberal mindset you can do anything that doesnt harm anyone else. You have freedom and saftey to explore your world
- There is a higher mind that transcends and a primitive mind that has not evolved to live in our current society and can be tricked readily The ladder Top rung higher mind fully 3rd rung higher mind on top but primitive mind there 2nd rung primitive mind on top higher mind still present Bottom rung Only primitive mind no higher mind present Complex thought vs animalistic behavior. Some competition like sports is good even though engages the lower wrong because it provides an outlet and it’s all in good fun But other times it becomes destructive when it becomes zero-sum in a political landscape that ivolves the lives of many
    - **Tags:** #trade-offs, #outlet-to-blow-off-steam, #critical-approach-(conjectures-and-refutations), #system-1-vs-system-2, #the-ladder
    - **Note:** The higher mind and primitive mind are both present like the 2 systems and sometimes we need to engage these tendencies to let loose but other times its very dangerous, so when engaged we must be mindful and we must stay on the higher rungs when it matters.
- Idea spectrum range of what people believe thank you and their stances. This reduces complex topics to readily digestible pieces but in that they provides a good framework. Idea spectrum example US is the best country do US does a lot well but it has issues the US does a little well but it’s mostly bad the us is terrible The ladder is how we think the spectrum is what we think. The High rung is about getting to truth and the low rung is about being consistent with your beliefs Scientist want to form a hypothesis by understanding what is out there and then evaluating it. Gather info is about quantity and evaluating it is about quality and trusting the info source. Trusting indirect knowledge is vital. Trust when placed well creates knowledge that compounds but when placed poorly creates the illusion of knowledge which is worse than no knowledge Form a hypothesis and then test it. And improve it. These people are terrified of being wrong but this fuels their fire to find truth because they want to be right over the long run not in the moment. Thinking like a sports fan is motivated reasoning but there is still a desire for truth do you want the game to be played fairly and the best team to win but you also want your team to win and have a vested interest so you’re not completely unbiased but you still have integrity to first principles of the game Thinking like an attorney you have a client who you need to work for and it’s just about winning for them and cherry picking evidence so your idea looks right it’s not about truth it’s about making one-sided arguments for specifically your vested interest even if you’re morally on the wrong side you don’t care. Shut off your ability and desire to see anything that is not your side in court this works well because both sides are stealmanning their argument then impartial judge makes a decision but in your head it’s just a corrupt court room with both sides saying the same thing. They still respect some form of knowledge gathering Thinking like a zealot every idea is your baby and tied to your identity and you won’t believe anything against it because it’s an attack on you

    - **Note:** Idea spectrum and the ladder. The spectrum is what we think which isnt really material either way. The ladder or how we think is much more important. The steelman of the ladder is the scientist want to the truth so bad you are relentlessly error seeking. Then the sports fan and lawyer have a vested interest, but are defending the rules of the game. The zealot wants to win at all costs and wont change his mind. The lawyer is more biased because they cherry pick evidence while the sports fan accepts what is in front of them.
      High wrung wants to be right in the long term not the moment while low wrung wants to win.
      Also mentioned the importance of sources because you cant diligence everything gives you leverage. The illusion of knowledge is worse than no knowledge
      This really shows how people can form identities and how dangerous this is and how the critical approach is vital to learning. You want to find where youre wrong to be right vs wanting to be right to feel good. You want to be critical in the short term to be right in the long term
- Intellectual communities help shape our thinking because we are shaped by those who we interact with often and ideal lab is a term made up to describe a scientific thinking culture of criticism and conjecture. Idea labs Creates a culture of how to think echo chambers create a culture of what to think Ideas get foreigners through emergence spiders fight spiders for power but ants cooperate because spiders are the emerging being in the ecosystem well aunts are part of the colony which is really the organism

    - **Note:** idea labs are focused on how to think not what to think. Create a culture of creativity and openness. Thinking for yourself and honest thoughts /opinions. Working together toward a common goal of knowledge acquisition
- Genies versus golems e.g. a genie wants truth and values diverse thinking of each of the individuals to create a diverse perspective to create a hive mind of intellectual diversity God values creativity and understanding while Gollum is just about conformity the quality of a Gollum is how well the ants fall in line and for the betterment of the colony Genghis Khan formed a very strong Gollum that created one of the best military powers the world has ever seen surely predicated on fear and a single minded ruthlessness that couldn’t be swayed. It thrived not by a diversity of viewpoints but a singularity of them. The specialty is brute strength. Gollums rely on us vs them with common enemy. Intelligence rises and grows on the high rungs but we’re programmed for low rung.

    - **Note:** Genies vs gollums one creates and fosters open and honest debate the other all conforms to the same viewpoint and path to achieve that view. Sometimes to drive a movement you need a gollum, but other times you need the bottoms up buy in. Genie measured by diversity gollum measured by unanimity.
- If all of human history was a 1000 page book the last 250 years would be on page 1000 and this is when a massive change has occurred because of the acceleration of technology. This means more good but also more danger. This is all happening at a time when people are becoming more childish. Those who fail to remember the past are destined to repeat it. Technology increases in a linear fashion but wisdom oscillates. We don’t use 100 year old computers bud we have gotten less wise and more wise.

    - **Note:** Human nature is cyclical and unchanging but technology drives us forward. Also gives you perspective on all we have accomplished.
