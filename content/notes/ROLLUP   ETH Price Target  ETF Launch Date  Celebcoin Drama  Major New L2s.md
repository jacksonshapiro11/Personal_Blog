- Innovations of Tycho in Ethereum Network
  Summary:
  Tycho introduces a base roll-up, utilizing Ethereum validators as sequencers, enhancing decentralization.
  It enables interoperability between Ethereum main net and the Tycho layer two, fostering liquidity. Tycho and Ethereum layer one share a strong bond due to the common operators, the Ethereum validators.
  A token launch distributing 5% of its supply is planned post main net launch, with the distribution method yet to be finalized.
  Tycho aims for a decentralized sequencer set-up, potentially launching with training wheels in the form of multi-sig upgrades.

  Tycho is a ZK EVM, but it is also a base roll up.
  Speaker 1
  So we all like the ZK EVM because everything's going to the ZK world and eventually. But the base roll up is the first of its kind. That's kind of the shiny new technology that tycos bringing to Ethereum. A base roll up is a roll up that uses Ethereum validators as sequencers for the roll up itself. So it actually kind of starts with a leg up in terms of decentralization of the sequencer. But then it also gets to tap into the state of the Ethereum layer one as it produces blocks on the tyco layer two. And so liquidity between like uniswap on Ethereum main net and liquidity inside of tyco. So all right, pool not even not perfectly the same pool, but like highly interoperable. And so like tyco and the state of Ethereum layer one have like a very strong bond because the operators of both networks are the same people, which are the Ethereum validators, which
  Speaker 3
  Is pretty cool.
  Speaker 1
  And they're also being pretty explicit about their token launch. They're saying they're going to distribute 5% of its 1 billion supply a few weeks after main net goes live.
  Speaker 3
  How they intend to really distribute their token TBD.
  Speaker 1
  That's a really early in the lifespan of a network to also release their token. But who knows?
  Speaker 2
  I kind of wonder what Tycho will look like on L2B. Well, just like because it's using a decentralized sequencer set of the game, does it have like all the pie slots full?
  Speaker 3
  I know it's going to launch the pitch of Tycho is like they get some green slices.
  Speaker 2
  It's going to launch with training wheels at first. So it'll be like multi-sig upgrade. So like that won't be green. Those slices won't be green, but it does have decentralized sequencers, I guess, right at the right of the game. ([Time 1:01:38](https://share.snipd.com/snip/90c6e490-c4ff-4524-92c3-e13a21cbb83e))
