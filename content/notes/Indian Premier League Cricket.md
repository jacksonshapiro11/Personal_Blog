### Highlights

- There is a guy who understands tv and cricket and he creates this cricket league. There is this body that runs Indian cricket. All the players stadiums negotiate tv rights. He realized how much value was being left on the table and started renegotiating every deal. Turned it into a massive profit center went from 100k a match to 1mm a match. Then he gets the idea to create this league he owns all the talent. Other people try this but don’t have the talent. A bit curropt but that’s how they do business. Indian middle class is growing so much and cricket is 93% of all sports watched in India time wise. So more disposable income. Sells the rights of cricket to big tv provider. When he couldn’t find any sports only he had a network create a sports arm. When he launches the league he realizes he need to attract women and kids so he partners with Bollywood to attract these people. Realizes he’s not competing with sports but all entertainment. Creates a very even league with a ton of parody and pageantry. It’s 50-50 men and women viewers he just nails execution. Understood the market so well and right place and time. They install competitive balance.

So one of the top AAA list actresses, an actress named Preeti Zinta, she ends up becoming the principal owner to buy another one of the teams. So this is even more amazing. Now you've got one of the top actresses who's coming in as the principal owner of a team so now you've got not just shah rook who even alone that would have been enough to draw in the women In the general entertainment audience and beat the soap operas now you've got triple a top list one of the best actresses in bollywood who's also going to be a principal owner of one of The teams who's also going to be at all the games also in the stands also going to have tv cameras all over her and then it's just going to bring the whole circus.
