  Speaker 1
  Think about the pain inflicted on those around you if your business goes under and the financial hardship that you potentially incompetence could put your family through, right? But in this case, so that's like the metaphor that me and you and I are using. But in this case, incompetence can get you killed. And so they send him to Singapore. And there's going to be like a year and a half, maybe two years before he gets taken captive. And he's just noticing the arrogance and the complacency and the incompetence of the British military at this point. And here's the first example, he arrives where he's going to be stationed. And he's like, this is kind of weird. I noticed immediately that the fencing did not extend all the way around the barracks. And it seemed a rather sleepy haven. And then he talks about the training and the equipment. They wasn't adapted to the environment. I think about this all the time because Ed Dorp says, Charlie Munger says the same thing, the only way to play to win in business is to play games where you have an edge. There's a line that that stuck out. I read this biography of George Washington and Ben Franklin. It's called Franklin in Washington. It's episode 251. If you haven't listened to it, I'm going to tell you a line from there one second because talks about, Hey, the military police would literally pick you up and put the soldiers in jail if they weren't wearing the proper uniform. They're in the tropics. You know how hot Singapore is? And listen to what they're having them do under penalty of arrest. If we were spotted without wearing our proper uniform, including our thick red checkered wool caps, despite the intense heat, the military police would pick us up. There's an excellent line that I've never forgotten in the Franklin and Washington biography. It's actually what led to Ben Franklin meeting George Washington is the fact that George Washington was helping the British soldiers fight the Native Americans. The British soldiers took what worked in Europe and tried to transport into a completely different environment, thinking that would win a war against the Native Americans and the Native Americans were just destroying them, which Washington wrote about and was published in a newspaper. That's how Ben Franklin met and became aware of Washington and won a meeting on the line from the book is you might as well send a cow in pursuit of a rabbit. The Indians were customed to these woods. The Native Americans were playing within the circle of competence. The British soldiers were not. And so you know who's going to win that game. We see a very similar example in Singapore right during World War II. The quartermaster handed me my rifle. I thought he was kidding. I stared at this antique gun with utter disbelief. I saw that it was dated 1907. It was a bashed up relic from before the First World War. Remember this main theme is that incompetence can get you killed. This is spread across many pages is another example. Bizarrely each day between 1 p.m. And 3 p.m. The whole camp came to a standstill for a siesta. Every man had to be in his bunk during that period. So they're taking a nap. I disagree with this from the start. The enemy seemed unlikely to suspend hostilities to allow us time to rest during the hottest part of the day. It was hardly suitable training for jungle warfare, but our superiors thought differently. This ridiculous routine was typical of the complacency that served the British so badly in Singapore. Moving ahead, another note of myself, a main theme of this book, never underestimate human incompetence. So now they're training. They're trying to train them for this fight that they'll likely take place in the jungle. And they're not realizing that your ideas aren't going to work here. Their tactics seemed antiquated and obvious. And they would have us weaving through the jungle. The enemy would have seen us coming from miles away. The officers were completely out of their depth. And so he makes the point over and over again. This was incompetence combined with over confidence. The British is the largest empire in the world at this point. And he thought it was weird. It's like on the ground, I'm seeing all this like these stupid ideas. We have terrible antiquated weapons. We're in these ridiculous uniforms that just make our job, make doing our job even harder. We're in the tropical sun. Our officers are drunks, which I haven't even got to yet. And yet, if you read the local newspaper, there's all these headlines saying Singapore is impregnable. ([Time 0:09:59](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4bcf640c-a080-4436-9021-952b1814799e))
    - **Note:** Incompetence can get you killed when he was in Singapore the military outpost had siestas and stupid rules they were in the middle of the jungle fighting outside their circle of competence and still were arrogant. They were training them not for the jungle at all this was deep incompetence combinded with over confidence. The news talked about how strong the brittish hold on Singapore was but the view from the ground couldn’t have run more counter to that. Mastery is not a destination but a continuous process. He went through much hardship but this did not make him bitter it only made him love life more. The locals started to flee but the military leaders only grew more confident while the men feared the emperor was wearing no clothes. Then the Japanese attacked they were professionals while the brittish were amateurs and they were all taken at gun point.

  Speaker 1
  They look like professionals, and they're just running through us like a hot night through butter. And now we get into this unbelievable torture that he's going to be under for the next five years. So they come in, they take everybody at gunpoint. They're bayonetting people, they're chopping people's heads off. And he's out in the blazing sun. Remember, these are, they're broadly Northern European, right? They're not supposed to be this close to the equator. As we stood there in the blazing sun without food, water or shelter, the horrible reality broke over me and sickening depressing waves. I was a prisoner. It was a gut wrenching realization to think that my liberty was gone, and there would be no telling for how long it would be. So this was the worst moment of my life, essentially, he's saying, I have no freedom. I have no autonomy. I have no control. So they make them start to watch a her, they make them start to march rather a horrific site confronted us. We came face to face with a thicket of severed Chinese heads, speared on poles on both sides of the road. For the rest of our march, spiked heads appeared at intervals in this way. They are forced to march over 18 miles and on both sides of the road for 18 miles. You have people's decapitated heads on spikes. And so they are immediately put into these squalid conditions. He is going to have a bevy of tropical diseases. I'll go through all of them and then I'll like summarize this at the very end. Everybody has dysentery, which torched your stomach lining and had you running to the latrines dozens of times a day. So he's got dysentery at the same time he gets his first bout of malaria. He's going to get dysentery malaria, tropical ulcers over and over again. I didn't know what a tropical ulcer was before I read this book. And then I made the mistake of doing a Google image search. I remember the very first time I searched for it, Google used to show it to you right away. Now they have the thing where if you do a Google image search of tropical ulcers, you know, they kind of pixelated or like, are you sure you want to see this? Essentially, your flesh is eating away and you can see the bone. That's going to happen over and over again. I suffered my first bout of malaria with no sprays and mosquito nets. The place was alive with insects. And so let's go back to this feeling of, hey, I have no autonomy, no control. They don't tell you what they're going to do with you. They're just marching one day. Now they're going to put them. He doesn't even know he's on the death march. This is some famous event in World War II. He's going to eventually build the, they called the death railway and then the bridge over the river kwai. They can make movies about this. But this is how they transport them. They put, there's these, these trains and there's these shipping containers that are about 18 feet by 10 feet and they throw them in there with 30, 40 other men. If you don't get, if you refuse to get in the train, they'll bayonet you and then they close the door and it's like, oh, this, he says, this felt like a death sentence in a stifling steel box. We stood there for hours before the train started moving. The heat was appalling. Dehydration setting quickly and coupled with the malaria I already had, I was suffering. There is no space to lay down. The smell inside the carriage became unbearably foul without toilets. The men had to relieve themselves where they stood. Several were very ill with malaria, dysentery and diarrhea. People vomited and fainted and this is dust came in to the container and it is added to our unbearable thirst. It was 36 hours before we were let out of the wagon. When they were let out of the wagon, it was just a stop to give them like a measly portion of rice. ([Time 0:17:48](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a360d21f-feff-48c8-bdd7-11f27454b619))
    - **Note:** Once they’re taken at gun point they’re marched 18 miles with spiked heads lining the track. They encountered dysentery malaria among other illnesses and were lead on death marches. They lost all their autonomy. He considered killing himself and little did he know he would have 5 more years of this. They hiked 11 days through the jungle then we’re told they were constructing a railway that was so tough to build it would kill 16k people in construction. In the March allistar kept towards the front he did not want to see people give up and die as it may effect his will to live. The ones that died first were the younger more fit people the older ones who had something to live for died slower. The mind is a powerful place and what you feed it effects you in a powerful way. They worked every day and were fed rations even when sick.

  Speaker 1
  The younger like the 19 year olds, the 20 year olds died at a faster rate than like the 30 and 40 year olds because the 30 and 40 year olds had something to live for. A lot of the men were married and we talk about their families back home. These slightly older men in the 30s and 40s survived in much greater numbers. Surprisingly, it was the young men who died first on the railway. The older men had families that they had to live for. And when I reread that part, maybe I heard this crazy story on a podcast years ago, there was this former NFL player who used to play for the Miami Dolphins. I can't remember his name at the moment, but he was by himself. He was like taking his boat. I think he was like 17. Let me say 10 miles offshore. I don't it was like it was far. Let's say 10 miles, maybe 15 miles, something like that. Offshore, he was taking his boat from one spot to another. It was on auto pilot. He was by himself. He went to the back, tried to fix something and it hit like a like hit a bump and he had fallen out of his boat and the boat just kept going. And he's like, oh shit. And so he had no choice but to start swimming to shore. Like I said, 10 or 15 miles away. And so he goes on this insane journey all throughout the night. So he starts swimming at maybe like mid morning. I think he doesn't get to shore till the next day at like five in the morning or something like that. And he tells the story and all he could think of was I have my daughters. I have my daughters. I have my wife. Like the amount of pain when he he survives, he goes to the hospital, like all the skin like head from his neck and his head and his back have been completely ripped off because thing about like you're just swimming, right? You're doing like stroke like your swim stroke through the ocean again. You know, there's waves, there's sun, there's salt water and just rips off all the skin. You're completely dehydrated. And just this idea where it's like I have to survive, not for me, but for my young kids and like that that that the amount of motivation and like mental fortitude that that gave him, you know, he lands the next morning, which humbles up the beach, knocks on somebody's door. He'd been gone so long and they had found his boat that his wife was already resigned to the fact that her husband was dead and she was waiting till the morning to tell their kids that their dad was not coming back. We do not understand the power of the human mind. That is so apparent. And we forget that we don't understand the power of the human mind. In fact, there's another character in the book. I don't know if I'll get to his name is Dr. Matheson. He is he's winds up saving all sorts of life a bunch of times, but he's a doctor, but they have no they have no supplies. And so he's he's racking his brain about how he can help these people. And what he realized was he starts giving people their like deathly ill or like death's door. He starts giving them objection injections of it's like water with a little bit of salt in it. And he tells them like it's a it's a special medication. It's going to get you better, whatever, you know, it's going to kill all the bacteria and everything else. And the people just that that placebo effect actually worked. And so that is insane. And again, that I think that is the main point of reading this book of listening to the audio book, just realizing, man, you are so much stronger. You can endure so much more than you think you can. Let's go back to this. He has one mantra, survive this day. Every morning, I would tell myself over and over, survive this day, survive this day, survive this day, survive this day. We all suffer from depression. Men were taking their own lives. Men cut their own throats or simply walked into the jungle to die. That is the consequence of not having that kind of mental fortitude. Going back to all kinds of diseases that they're forced to work in. ([Time 0:26:07](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2cd14d59-8567-4609-9621-d20860acd492))
    - **Note:** The mind is a powerful place and finding a purpose in life can make you bear any how or circumstance. Having beliefs and something to love for is massive in life. Men were killing themselves left and right it was all about who had the mental fortitude to just keep going. There was a doctor who injected sick men with salt water which worked for many. The torture at these prisons is constant and horrible. Allistar fights a rapist back and is sent to solitary confinement for a week for hitting a guard where he is starved and beaten. He dug maggots out of the outhouse and put it on his open wounds to help heal himself. He gets sent to a hospital camp after he can no longer walk and he’s lucky he isn’t killed. Survived collerah.

  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Cholera had been the final straw for my health. I could no longer walk. He has to relearn how to walk. Dysentery, malaria, berry berry, and gaping ulcers heading golf both ankles and lower calves. I could no longer even move my legs. And so he is nearly dead, but he had good karma. Remember when back in Singapore, they dropped off this 14, 15 to 16 year old kid. They're like, take care of them. They all looked up even though allisters on like five years older, he like genuinely cared for them and protected them. And so he hadn't seen them and I don't know, it's been like a year and a half or something like that. And so he winds up running into the younger kid. The kid is like 15 or 16. That's the Freddy kid. Freddy, he was like uncontrollable in the sense like he would explore the camp. He was extremely outgoing. He'd make relationships with everybody. He was a good smogler. He's like this little kid. And so the reason I say he had good karma is that Freddy and his brother had been put at this hospital camp the whole time and they were healthy. And so they were able to smuggle Alice or extra food to help him recover food that other people recovering in the hospital camp did not get access to. The supplements to my diet of two egg omelets, molasses, coconut papaya assisted in my recovery and probably helped save my life. And so he still cannot walk yet. And so this is where he's learning mind control. This is where again, he's writing a book at 90 years old detailing every single thing that he went through to inspire you to not give up. Think about the kind of mind control that you have to be able to do something like that. There was nothing to do but sit and wait it out. By now I could shut down my mind more easily than before and ignore my terrible thoughts. So once he's nursed back to health and able to walk again, his captors are not going to sit there and let him, you know, he's not going to be hanging out at the hospital camp anymore. He's put exactly but he's put back to work. They take him back to Singapore and now he has to work at the docks. It says I had decided to stay apart from everyone else and focus totally on survival. I lived a day at a time in my own little world, a private cocoon. To survive each day required maximum concentration. It also meant that you had to conserve every possible ounce of energy. I was so damn tired all the time. They're working from sunrise to sunset many times after night, right? They're being starved. They don't have enough calories. He winds up, I think at the beginning of the war, he's like 135 pounds. When the US Marines rescue him at Nagasaki, he's like 82 pounds. He looks like a Holocaust survivor. You sleep but you're never fully recovered ever. And then your body's energy is also drained by all these tropical diseases that he has too. This is when he's working at the docks and again, there's no autonomy, there's no control, there's no predictability. They just keep moving him around. And that's one of the like the unknown is one of the things that your humans are usually most scared of. ([Time 0:36:19](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2f1b2a86-e941-4eff-8331-d733394bdeaa))
    - **Note:** The kids he had cared for earlier in the war are at the hospital camp he gets sent to and smuggle extra food in and nurse him back to health help him learn to walk again and likely save his life. However once he is useful again he has to go back to working on the docks. He starts the war 135 pounds and ends it at 82. He is then put on a hell ship where people are killing other people for food and drinking their blood the dead we’re just left there until on day 5 it gets torpedoed allistar knew he needed to swim away as fast as he could or he would be pulled down. Despite being near dead he got a hold of a raft and was adrift for 5 days. He is then picked up by a Japanese whaling ship paraded around a city naked then held at Nagasaki. He reunited with the doctor from the original camp who told him about the maggots and he tells him that if he were to be rescued he couldn’t eat too quickly or his stomach would break and he would die. He feels a breeze that knocks him down the Americans had bombed Nagasaki this lead to his rescue. He returns home and everyone thought he was dead. His girlfriend had left him and his best friend had died and he sat home for months wondering if this life was worth living. He pick up ballroom dancing and that’s how he meets his wife it saves his life. He shows how it’s so important to be resilient and keep on trucking. Freddy the guy who saved him at the camp died drank himself to death.

  For months, he struggles with trying to be a social person, trying to get healthy. He still was too sick to work. And then he had this love before the war of ballroom dancing, something he's still doing. He passed away a few years ago. But something he was still doing, even though in his 90s. And that actually, getting into something he loved, wanted to be the best rehabilitation forum. That's how he winds up meeting his wife. That's why he winds up building up his strength. And he just said, the best rehabilitation I could have ever asked for was ballroom dancing. And then unexpectedly, he has a reunion with Freddie. Freddie was in the war when he was like 15 years old. He's probably, let's say, probably 2021 when he shows up at the door. One day in July, 1946, there came a knock at the door. I had visitors. I came downstairs, opened the door and almost fell over. Freddie stood there with his trademark grin. This is very important because some people never recover from the war. So it's one thing to survive, right? Physically, he also survived mentally, not let it inhibit you living the rest of your life. For the rest of his life, Freddie would phone me every night, no matter what was happening in either of our lives. But Freddie never came out of the camps, and he drank heavily to forget he would die within 10 years of returning of cirrhosis of the liver, still a young man. And so he talked about this motivating self to do not let the same thing happen to him. Yet I owed it to myself and to the others who never made it back to make the most of my life. And he brings it up to the 90 year old version of him. My two children grew up and I took great pleasure from their success as I did when my grandchildren came along. Life continued to throw up challenges. After my wife Mary suffered a stroke losing the power of speech, I nursed her for 12 and a half years. Do all of this, my sufferings as a prisoner taught me to be resilient, to appreciate life and all that it has to offer, which he did. And he says, and at 90 years of age, I'm still working on my Fox trot. And so now I want to put the book down. And I want to read to you that my summary that I wrote to myself the first time I had read the book. And so this text I'm about to read to you, I will put it down below in case you want to copy it because also when I'm stressed, I find rereading this helpful. And so here's what I wrote to myself and for myself many, many years ago, Alistair Urkhart was conscripted into the British military to fight during World War II. He was 19 years old. He was sent to Singapore. The Japanese invaded and he was taken hostage. He survived 750 days in the jungle, working as a slave on the death railway and the bridge to the river Kwaai. Most of the time he worked completely naked. He contracted dysentery, malaria and tropical ulcers a lot. He was transferred to a Japanese health ship. The ship was torpedoed. Almost everyone on the ship died. He did not. He spent five years adrift at sea until he was picked up by a Japanese whaling ship. He was sent to Nagasaki and forced to work in a mine. Two months later, he was struck by the blast from the atomic bomb. He was freed by the US shortly thereafter. He returns home to Scotland and finds out his best friend died in the war and the girl he loved got married and moved to Canada. At 90 years of age, he wrote the book to inspire others to persevere when they are faced with hardships in their life. I think it's a great book for entrepreneurs. The story demonstrates the adaptability of all humans, our fears desire to survive and puts the stress of building companies into the proper perspective. The entire story only takes three hours in 14 minutes. I hope this podcast serves as a reminder that we're all way stronger than we all know and I hope I can convince you to buy the audiobook. If you want more details than buy the paperback version that I have, which is much, much longer, I will leave a link down below.
