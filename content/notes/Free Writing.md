### Highlights

- “I can live with doubt and uncertainty and not knowing.  I think it's much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers which might be wrong. I have approximate answers and possible beliefs and different degrees of uncertainty about different things, but I am not absolutely sure of anything and there are many things I don't know anything about, such as whether it means anything to ask why we're here. I don't have to know an answer. I don't feel frightened not knowing things, by being lost in a mysterious universe without any purpose, which is the way it really is as far as I can tell.”
  -Richard Feynman
  In this age of infinite knowledge all viewpoints are becoming widespread and commoditized. There are legitimate arguments for anything from fluoride in the water to flat earth. In this treadmill of noise, how do we really take a step back and deduce a well-reasoned position that addresses the big questions posed in the field and weighs them on merits?  Understanding that many generational ideas like evolution or genetics were once thought of as fringe ideas of crazy people. Galileo was accused of heresy for suggesting that the sun, not the earth, was the center of the universe. Galileo was wrong about this scientifically, but in some deeper sense the Church's position was the right one to take.  Our lived experiences put us at the center of our universe and to reject this belief about ourselves was too fundamental in the belief web to seriously address, so they just banished him. This event is an example of the complex calculus that goes into what someone believes as this is not just a truth judgement, but a function of how this new idea fits into the lives of those who listen, and if they are willing to bear the consequences that comes with accepting the premises. These emotional aspects in decision making and changing our beliefs are inherent in human nature. How can we figure out a good framework for thinking that does not bias what we think and gives us a high probability result. The answer to this has roots that date back to the time of Galileo in the Renaissance and has been popularized by many. We will focus on tactics ideas and examples throughout history on a conjectural way for approaching all situations critically and open mindedly.
  In Tim Urban's newest book, he juxtaposes the ideas of an idea ladder and spectrum. The spectrum is what you say while the ladder is how you say it. Democrats and republicans are on the opposite sides of the spectrum, but this says nothing of their placement on the ladder. Tim's framework for the ladder spans the range between thinking like a scientist and thinking like a zealot, which boils down to the idea of valuing truth seeking versus being right. The argument here is one of a long vs short term incentive misalignment. Choosing to seek truth now will get you closer to the answer in the future when compared to the blind belief in your ideology, which makes you right in the present moment. The issue with truth seeking is tied to the idea of the fallibility of human knowledge and makes defaulting to being a zealot much easier than truth seeking. Because zealots can always be right in the moment, and we only have the capacity to live in the present, the zealot can never be wrong.  They can resist the truth until their death leading to the mantra of "progress in a field happens one death at a time." As a brave truth seeker, one can only hope to be incrementally less wrong over time and never have full confidence in being right. A truth seeker should have complete confidence in the fact that they are always wrong, the fallibility of their own knowledge, because this is likely closer to the ground truth.
  Urban likens the low rungs on the ladder to Disney World because you feel magical being there, but it’s all an inch thick and a completely warped view of the real world.  Disney movies always end happy.  The bad guys get what’s coming to them because they are bad, and the good guys win because they are good.  When you adopt this mindset, you cast your world view as the good side and everyone else as bad.  You expect and deeply believe that you deserve to be right and powerful in this world.  This is compared to the world of the scientist, who is venturing his best guess into the world then ruthlessly testing it.  One side starts out knowing they’re right while the other just wants to prove themselves wrong.
  This deep superiority complex is what creates static and dynamic societies.  Static societies as outlined by David Deutsch propagate by their spreading of anti-rational memes that inhibit progress while dynamic societies thrive on intellectual diversity and progress.  Deutsch and Urban both get to the same place with regard to the concept of static vs dynamic societies, but Deutsch advances the conversation by invoking his concept of active optimism.  As opposed to blind optimism or even blind pessimism, active optimism takes a positive view regarding the future and mandates we as humans be the drivers of that positive future.  He first takes a dynamic view of the world and then mandates creativity as the only solution to these problems.  Static societies think the future is more like the past and try to optimize and extrapolate while a dynamic society seeing the current state of the world tries to bend and shape it to its will.  Easter Island vs the early settlers of Brittan provides a good comparison in the thinking of static and dynamic societies.  The people of Easter Island when they faced trouble turned more and more towards religion spending more time cutting down trees and building statues to their gods.  Thinking that would provide them food and prosperity.  The Island naturally has a strong climate and would be more friendly to life than the island of Great Brittan, so why did life succeed in the more unlikely place.  Easter Island saw problems and used the same explanation.  They appealed to the gods and as their situation worsened; they thought they needed to pray harder.  The people of England saw the horrible frigid barren winters and devised different forms of shelter and agriculture along with food preservation to continue to develop as a society.  Static societies like Gollum’s shut down discussion and knowledge growth; they thrive on the status quo and resist the creation of knowledge, but dynamic societies create rational memes that lead to the creation of new knowledge.  One seeks to inhibit critical faculties, the other engage them.
  Daniel Kahnamen invokes the idea of turning our mental faculties on and off in different situations through the mental model of system 1 and system 2.  System 1 is our default static state of assuming the world is what it is.  This is the preferred state because accepting things is much easier than trying to think through them.  System 2 is effortful, engaging, and certainly not the default position.  Living in a static society is mentally much easier, but we can miss the gorilla right in front of our faces.  Viewing the world in a static unchanging end of history way or a whitespace primed for idea generation and creation has a massive effect on the trajectory of someone’s life.  Some view the world as a solved problem while others believe it constantly hides secrets for the curious ones to uncover.
    - **Note:** Core to Zero to One is the idea of secrets.   Peter Thiel asks, “What secrets do you know about the world that nobody else does?”  There is a wealth of secrets that are unseen to the public and are waiting to be discovered. Ted Kaczynski was a genius by most measures, but he thought there were no hard problems left and nothing to be discovered; this drove him to a point of near madness and nihilism when his incredible talents could have been utilized to enhance not tear down society. He did not believe there was anything that could be improved believing that “technology has had a destabilizing effect on society, has made life unfulfilling, and has caused widespread psychological suffering.” This line of thinking is poison and emblematic of static societies.  We’re taught to learn incrementally, taught to tests, that there is a right answer and that not only would we find it if we were smart enough but some authoritative figure a teacher or scientist already knows and we are working within a deterministic system.  We are not taught to be explorers and learn more than needed because there is no direct benefit to doing so within our current education system.  This creates the idea of a bounded universe of important knowledge with nothing left to be discovered outside of it. But there is always a new frontier, when you push hard enough.  A tenant of the frontier is taking unorthodox ideas seriously and don’t believe everything has been discovered.  Crazy ideas being rejected then later accepted as common wisdom is not the exception, but the rule in scientific history.  Gregor Mendel was committed to an insane asylum for these beliefs on genetics and it took years after his death as an unknown monk to come to the realization the crazy man with the peas may have been on to something.  Secrets are a guide to finding new areas of high leverage in society that requires novel insights.  The benefit of this is that there is a lot more space and a lot less competition on the ever-expanding frontier.  What the critical approach draws from the idea of secrets is that the only way to get to the frontier is to approach intrenched ideas as merely conjectural and try to poke holes in fundamental areas of society.  Secrets are found by explorers not optimizers.  As Walter Isaacson said of Leonardo Da Vinci, “Talent hits targets others cant reach, but genius hits targets others cant see.”  Usain Bolt’s immense talent made him the fastest man in the world, and mere talent would say the best way for someone to increase their speed would be an intense fitness regimen and a better diet.  This approach is patiently wrong and views travel as a static society.  Using secrets and a conjectural mindset it becomes obvious the way to increase speed for the average person is not to implement this training method, but to ride a horse or drive a car.  This is core to a secret; it reframes a problem at a higher level or emergence to get to the root issues not the proximate causes. Belief is vital as secrets by their nature of illuded man for 200,000 years, so they are non-obvious and sound crazy.  If you believe something hard is impossible you’ll never even try to achieve it. 
      Much of this critical approach comes derived from Karl Popper’s work and views on the subject.  Popper believed that there were no authoritative sources of knowledge and our knowledge is never final but simply conjectural consisting of guesses that get more refined over time.  This critical rationalism underlies much of the progress in the great expanse of human history.  Critical rationalism posits that our knowledge is not final, but conjectural and consisting of guesses. Hypotheses, rather than truths and critical discussion is the only way to get closer to the truth. Bold conjectures and free criticism are vital and need to be based on science with innovation being encouraged and boldness admired.  The essence of this world view is articulating clearly your views then giving someone a sledgehammer and asking them to destroy it as best they can.  Over time the weaker ideas get destroyed and replaces the remaining views become closer to the truth because they have been exposed to more tests against reality.  Popper does not view ideas as babies but as tools in the belt of life to be sharpen refined and replaced to produce the greatest opportunity of survival and growth.  His style is one of bold conjectures and fierce refutations in an intellectually honest way to drive toward the truth.  His ideas trace back to more clearly the renaissance, but those beliefs are predicated on work done in ancient Greece by Xenophanes and Heraclitus among others.
- The basis of critical rationalism rests on some of the beliefs from Xenophanes and Heraclitus.  Heraclitus saw the world not as something stagnant, but as a system in flux and demanding constant adjustment.  Core to his belief was change relying on identity over time and that there were 2 schools of knowledge one that sought to preserve and one that sought to create.  Change is a leaf that over time turns brown, but not a green leaf that is swapped for a brown leaf as this gains the same exact result while missing the entire point of change.  True progressive change is an evolution from within not an intrusion from the outside.  The leaf needs to take in all the experiences of its existence to become brown and if it is merely swapped that leaf has been destroyed and replaced.  Change is a constant process of growth from within in the end being the sumproduct of your experiences.  Xenophanes asserts the conjectural nature of our knowledge, “Through seeking we may learn and know things better. But as for certain truth, no man has known it, nor shall he know it, neither of the gods nor yet of all the things of which I speak. For even if by chance he were to utter the final truth, he would himself not know it: For all is but a woven web of guesses.”  Objective truth is both asserted as real and near impossible to achieve as fallible beings.  There is little chance we would know objective truth even if it hit us in the face, so we need to realize that our truth is a “woven web of guesses.”  Therefore we must continue to test and refine our best explanations not treating knowledge as something sacred, but rather constantly testing them with the hardest challenges to either affirm them or find a blind spot and catalyze a replacement of them.  These two Greek men almost 3 millennia ago asserted that we live in an every changing world and we must test existing explanations and create new ones to push our knowledge forward.  This was as true in 500 BC as it is now and through the great expanse of history we look at the times of relative technological process as being fundamentally rooted in these beliefs.
  [Summary and lead into examples]
  The critical approach requires a high minded objective approach to the world that puts truth seeking above being right and requires the acknowledgement that our knowledge rests on fallible wisdom not set in stone maxims.  The world is a dynamic ever-changing place that necessitates fresh eyes and constant questioning.  Core to the critical approach is the fact that the world is built on change and we should assume the future will not be like the past due to the overhaul of fundamental assumptions.  Having layed out the base theory for this worldview lets dive into examples and counterexamples from people throughout history employing or rejecting this idea.
  To echo himself earlier, the great Richard Feynman would say, “I can live with doubt and uncertainty and not knowing. I think it is much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers that might be wrong. If we will only allow that, as we progress, we remain unsure, we will leave opportunities for alternatives. We will not become enthusiastic for the fact, the knowledge, the absolute truth of the day, but remain always uncertain … In order to make progress, one must leave the door to the unknown ajar.”  Core to his worldview was doubt and uncertainty.  This in many ways his personal articulation of the critical approach.  Core to the approach is being ok with living in uncertainty and understanding the fallibility of knowledge.  Feynman left ample room for uncertainty in his conclusions, but was more stringent in his methods and implementation of the critical approach.
    - **Note:** Bill Baker a president at Bells Labs believed that science rested on inquiry and not certainty.  The goal is not to know the answer to but ask why you might be wrong.  One of the key people in electricity and magnetism, Michael Faraday, took this to the next step.  He would attend lectures and instead of just taking notes and taking the lecturer at his word, he would go home and recreate the experiments.  He would own the process to first see if it worked then understand how it worked.  This gave him a deep understanding of the interconnectedness in systems which was critical in his work.  He did not accept what he was told was true, but questioned and recreated everything for himself.  In his biography of Albert Einstein, Walter Isaacson echo’s the sentiment, “You have to remain critically vigilant.” Question every premise, challenge conventional wisdom, and never accept the truth of something merely because everyone else views it as obvious. Resist being credulous.”  Much in the way Faraday was Einstein took no knowledge for granted and it was this critical approach that lead them to see things that people had missed for centuries.  Einstein as a mere patent clerk questioned the work of maybe the smartest man who had ever lived up until that time.  Because he was willing to investigate and question the deepest and most widely held beliefs, he vaulted himself to the role of leading citizen scientist in the minds of many.  To an extreme, Jeff Bezos has said he assumes every sentence he’s reading is wrong until he is able to understand and prove it for himself.   These formidable individuals who lead incredibly innovative organizations or make world altering discoveries first and foremost rested their core beliefs on a foundation of critical examination and inquiry.  Progress happens when you allow yourself to fundamentally question your reality in an open minded way.
      J. C. R. Licklider was a trailblazing member of the movement that would unseat the behaviorist and usher in a more holistic understand of psychology.  He worked at Harvard and founded the psychology program at MIT.  20 years into his career, he would leave academics to pursue the upstart field of computation.  He created the idea of human computer symbiosis and spearheaded the movement that founded the ARPANET, which then became the internet.  His style of understanding fit into two types of disagreements, Class 1 and Class 2.  A class 1 disagreement was an emotionally driven unproductive exercise in frustration, much like the lower rungs of the ladder.  The only talking in these disagreements are talking past each other.  Class 2 disagreements he defined as understanding the other side of the argument as well as you understood your own.  The person did not have to believe the argument; her feelings were irrelevant in the situation.  The goal was to understand each other’s mental models for the world at such a deep level that you had agreed roughly on the facts ideas and assumptions of the matter.  Then both sides would work to walk through their line of thought from the premises to the conclusions.  The other side would suspend their disbelief to take an open-minded walk through this person’s mind.  This is the peak high-minded approach at work; Lick is not merely listening to appease or even understand, but going a level deeper by fully owning the opposing world view.  Then taking the step by step approach of working together toward the best answer. This idea of understanding the other side of the argument and immersing yourself in it is not specific to Lick’s framework. 
      A key feature of this view is refuting your existing views to either destroy or strengthen them.  Charlie Munger has said, “I never allow myself to hold an opinion on anything that I don't know the other side's argument better than they do.”  While Ray Dalio has noted, he seeks out the smartest people who disagrees with him, so he can try to understand their reasoning and their side of the argument.  Here these men are highlighting how vital and core to their process understanding the other side of the argument is.  A seemly growing part of society seeks to shut down debate and remain close minded to anything that could hurt their argument, but these men seek to climb the ladder as high as possible.  They are not only willing and open to listening to others, but actively seeking disconfirming evidence.  This is the peak state of the critical approach. Understanding the mental and psychological investment in your position pre-disposes you to reflexively reject opposing views; these men crave the other side of the story because they know it will help them be right over the long term.  Disconfirming evidence is the ultimate short/long term incentive misalignment trade off because to be more right in the longer term you need to assume you’re wrong in the immediate term.
- In this world of immense data and AI models the critical approach is becoming less important because we have so many tools for analysis and digestion that human reasoning is becoming much less important.  For instance, cities with high instances of kidney cancer are rural small populations mostly Republican in the Midwest and South.  This is likely because their diet and lifestyle as well as environmental factors and no doubt political beliefs lead to this prevalence of kidney disease.  When we look at the areas with the lowest instance of kidney disease, we can likely credit it to among other things their diet and lifestyle as well as environmental factors and political beliefs.  The areas with the lowest instances of kidney disease are rural small populations mostly Republican in the Midwest and South… ops.  This example comes from Thinking Fast and slow as referenced earlier and it shows how we can use data and reasoning to justify things.  With data collection and processing being ever more commoditized the critical approach becomes much more not less important.  It becomes much easier to cherry pick and fool ourselves, as we become bombarded by the treadmill of information digesting and seeking to understand become much harder, so this approach of conjectures and refutations has become markedly more important.
  The clearest object to the rational approach comes from the post modern and high modernist thinkers.  High modernist thinkers like Le Corbusier did not need the critical approach because they had such a deep and correct understanding of the world that doubt was just a waste of time.  Le Corbusier, in his building of the capital city of Brasilia, deconstructed everything to its core unit of activity. The kitchen just for cooking not for eating and socializing, and he split cars and sidewalks from areas where people live. He split the essence of living from a few high level functions and believed his way was the right true way missing all nuance and thinking his beliefs were complete and scientific.  To combat this, a shadow city formed in Brasilia creating an emergent and organic ecosystem that Le Corbusier tried to hard to prevent.  In his construction of New York, Robert Moses used his high modern ideology to fix the traffic problem and thusly made it much worse.  He knew that cars were the future and wanted to adept the city to being car friendly, but the more bridges and roads he built the more not less crowded they got.  The issue is the investment into roads was coming at the expense of public infrastructure.  So while the roads were getting better their utilization and demand was actually going up because the alternatives were regressing.  Moses never changed his tune on roads and public infrastructure always opting for roads and bridges.  He stamped his seal on New York and inspired many other cities to center around cars when it was both cheap to build and the land was accessible to create better infrastructure. Reformer after reformer used facts and reason to reach Moses, but this was unneeded because he was so confident in his world view he didn’t even need to entertain these ideas.  Post modernist believe all ideas are just stories and narratives with no deep or objective truth.  Post modernist combine conjecture with nihilism and output a world view that believes very specific things sees anyone else’s world view as a narrative and rejects it as a false narrative, but accepts their way of thinking as the justified true belief way of the world.  They see the world as merely stories and deny the possibility of progress often using some slight of hand to assert their views as being right, with opposing ones not only wrong but evil, despite all views being merely conjectural.
  Is the critical approach always the best one to employ?  Jeff Bezos has a decision matrix that outlines how and what you should think when.  Decisions are split into quadrants based on how reversable and important they are.  An unimportant and highly reversable decision is likely a bad time for the critical approach because you need to make a decision fast and that decision doesn’t matter.  There is a decision making framework popularized by the NFL called the coin toss that is likely the optimal method in this scenario.  An example for this is whether you should pput on your right or left sock first; just put on the sock.  When the decision is important, but reversable the critical approach is not needed to such a deep extent because its better to just make the decision and try to a few options then collect data and see what that says.  An example would be the color of a website instead of thinking for hours just AB test 10 colors and see which one prompted the most engagement.  When something is irreversible but unimportant it’s easy to get hung up on it and employing mental faculties here to some deep level might make a little sense, but just be mindful of the return on time.  Repainting a house is pretty irreversible and unimportant, so just pick a color that wont fade too bad and wont poison the eyes of pedestrians everywhere and that should be sufficient.  Make sure you don’t detest it past the point of reconciliation and that the quality is above average, but do not expend too much mental effort.  Lastly, an important and irreversible decision is when the full implementation of the critical approach needs to be enacted.  Things like choice of spouse, job, personal philosophy, or Powerball numbers you’re about to play, winning that money is important and those numbers are irreversible.  Like Kahneman had said earlier, humans are lazy and thinking is hard, so don’t burden yourself with a deeply involved approach for the inconsequential decisions.  Create deep well reasoned mental frameworks and exist within them for most of your life adjusting and analyzing them constantly to see when new data or ideas show anomalies that fundamentally breakdown core beliefs.
  [law of small numbers]
  This critical theory of rationalism serves as a bottoms up form of knowledge gain.  The first premise is not that you know the big truth through your correct world view and then can fill in the gaps from there, but that you have some kernels of truth derived from years of your lived experience and acquired from the lived experience of trusted sources.
- How do we construct our beliefs
  We would all like to think we can change our mind when the facts change, but we would also love to win the lottery, so the world isn’t perfect. Before we can endeavor to change our minds, we must first seek to understand how it works. We could discuss neuroscience until our heads turn blue, but I do not know too much about neuroscience, so instead we will abstract knowledge and beliefs to a meta level of connectionist knowledge and the belief web/stack. Looking at it this way everything we know is connected in some way to something else we know and moreover some things are built on top other things. For example, the knowledge of almost anything rests on the foundation of the language in which it is being communicated. Language is a core foundational until of knowledge in one way, but in another it’s useless. There is a big difference between the word chair and a physical chair; they in many ways are the same thing, but in a very real way could not be more different. The combination of lived experience and language forms a deep foundation of beliefs, experiences, and knowledge that leads to a reaction to “I sat down on a comfortable chair and panicked” that is very different to “I sat down on a comfortable chair and relaxed.” We construct our world as layers and levels. Our relaxation in a comfortable chair is different than it would be in a rigid one, but moreover relaxation to one person might be reading a book and to another playing a violent video game. Here we are jumping up and down the stack in one way while traversing the web in another sense. What is key here is that our knowledge is a very interdependent construction. All of our knowledge lies in some relational connection to our model of the world. Moreover, some of these connections are deeper in the stack and thus harder to change. This hints at why it can be really easy to change our mind on some things, but on others its deeply painful to even think about doing so. This is different for different people. If you love milk chocolate and detest dark chocolate, but one day have the best piece of chocolate ever your opinion of dark chocolate may totally change. If you are just an average joe, this is easy, but if you are the president of the milk chocolate association, even considering trying dark chocolate may be sacrosanct. 
  Knowledge is connectionist  manifests as a web but also a stack but all of our models have bias and assumptions deeply engrained in them  we can advance knowledge in a local optimum way within the current models  but to make big changes we need to transcend paradigms and be willing to see anomalies as not a one off thing but as structural change needed to be made to our core assumptions and biases this is how knowledge grows  and we change our minds we make a really painful ripping up of the connections in our heads leaving space for the formulation of new ideas and growth  the highest level of knowledge is when we can exist outside the paradigms when were not in fields studying problems but when were studying great problems and using different models from different fields  instead of constructing beliefs in this field specific way we should use the connectionist knowledge we have and synthesize it on a whatever problem may be interesting to us  feynman hold 6 problems in your head  munger hold these high leverage models in your head  meadows transcend paradigms  problem focused field popper

   Belief web – this forms a web of beliefs that we have where because our knowledge is connectionist our beliefs are connectionist
   believe stack – not only are our beliefs woven together in a web but there also stacked on top of each other with some more foundational than others. The ones at the bottom are almost impossible to move because you have to take down everything they are built on and start from scratch and so we are more hesitant to examine and change these deeper beliefs in the stack because it’s a lot of mental work to do so and requires swallowing a lot of pride
   bias inherent in models – because all knowledge lies in its connection to other things all paradigms fields and ideas make assumptions. Economics assumes rational actors while evolution assumes variation and natural selection. These things are unseen but drive the outcomes of what’s going on because their the deeper in the stack fundamental assumptions we are making about the world. 
   Paradigm shifts are when we uproot the bias inherent in models because we no longer believe they are valid

- Nothing exists within a vacuum. Except of course outer space, which basically a vacuum and we all exist within it, so to us everything exists in a vacuum. Semantics, and aliens, aside we do not exist alone, but as a vast part of a larger cosmos. It becomes easy to lose sight of our rather small place in the infinitely vast universe, but we are a direct result of it. The earth was formed by a small subset of elements from the wider universe using simple rules to create life, consciousness, and sentience from empty space in a vacuum. This is essence and power of systems. Using self organization, resilience, and hierarchy, systems create a whole much greater than the sum of its parts. This is a result of economies of scales within systems. True understanding comes at the systems level. You cannot define a word by its definition says that to truly understand something one needs to understand that concept in relation to other concepts not in relation to itself. A mark of fundamental understanding is how well can we fit this new object into the already existing systems of our world. A systems view takes a wholistic approach to a concept and allows us to conceptualize the wider universe instead of focusing on a specific area. Systems exist in a simplified form, think a pendulum rocking from side to side in synchrony, or complex form, think a pendulum rocking side to side for hours changing its course due to friction. Here we dive into what are systems, how they manifest in the world, why we should try to view the world at a system not a point level, the complexity they involve and more.
- Mental control Inner Monologue and Happiness
  "If you live according to nature, you will never be poor; if you live according to opinion, you will never be rich." – Seneca
  Life can happen because of us or to us. There is a gap between what we experience and how we interpret that experience. When someone cuts you in line, mentally an avalanche can run through your brain. Everything to this person is a jerk to wow this person seems really stressed and rushed I better let them go first to completely apathy to the world. These reactions are related to the event, but they are not a result of the event. Our feelings are the choice we make influenced by many factors most notably our environment and mental state at the moment. In the age of social media, our brains are constantly being hacked to feel a certain way and react to certain things. The stress you feel toward an email from your boss was triggered by the same gut reactions that alerted us to a lion in the brush. However, when past humans could out run or at worst confront the lion and move on with their day, or not, we face these life and death reactions constantly. Additionally, we used to compare ourselves to the 20 other people in our village and every person could have a superlative. Someone could be the fastest, the wisest, ect. Now a loud sound and vibration has conditioned us to immediately reach for our phones and open the picture from a famous model or our friend’s latest trip to a private island. We are no longer one of one we are now n of 7 billion a barely distinguishable speck floating on a giant rock in a vacuum.
  [Perception vs reality] -> there is a gap between our experiences and how we digest those experiences
  [Inner Monologue] -> the difference between those two in that gap we create our internal monologue
  [Anxiety worse than the event] -> this leads to anxiety where we build an event up in our heads for one reason or another and its always worse
  [Mimetic Desire] -> what adds to this is that we don’t even want what we truly want which leads to more internal issues we want what were told to want and this leads to unhappiness
  [Inner Harmony + Internal Locus of control] -> the only proper way to live is with internal harmony and the only way to achieve that is with an internal locus of control doing what you want and what makes you happy
  [Frankle][Stoacism][David Foster Wallace][Mike Jordan]
  The power of the voice in our head
    - **Note:** Thin desires represent a top down view of happiness while thick desires are built bottom up. For our thin desires, we look to the outside world to inform us and this is what leaves them empty because we aren't finding what we want just what we're told to want. Thick desires represent something we would do every day of our lives for no other reason than that we love it. Thin desires leave you drained, but thick desires give you energy and feel like you are doing your life's work. Estee Lauder would do women's make up on the train for them and made make up in her home until she finally could strike out on her own at the age of 40. She was always working and did it not because it was work, but because she loved it. She was obsessed with beauty from a young age and worked on it when she had downtime at home to relax. The second she got a chance to make a living out of it she built one of the most transcend beauty brands of all time. Her deep obsession lead to to spend months over things people would not even think about and led her to have a deep understanding of her craft. She spent 3 years trying to get into Harrod's and spent 4 months on packaging, so it would fit perfectly in a customers bathroom. Make up was not something people were passionate about or that people thought someone let along a 40 year old woman with no work experience could revolutionize. Likewise, the Wright Brothers built bikes and plowed all the money they made from that in search of flying machines. Many died in this quest and they risked their life every day they flew. This was not a commerical thing, but a strange niche thing people thought were impossible, and they just did it because they loved it. When you understand what gives you energy and follow that as a throughline to your life
- We have every event in NYC or every city webscraped and on a website split into sports music ect and then we have places where people can indicate theyre going or want to go and can meet other people going to or interested in the event. Then we build this community of people talking about future events and interested in future events and then we can link to where you can buy tickets for the event on the website so it’s a fully integrated and easy experience then we backwards integrate into selling our tickets. Grab the market through creating this events based social media app where you can meet others and talk about events and then we have a ticketing solution where we call them “Our hosted events” benefits of these events are the collectables and SBTs. We go to the venues and artists and say well we have this community why not run an event with us because we have the demand and can promote you as our specific event and know who might be interested in the event is based on their interactions and demonstrated interest in other events and we just see everything. You can mark your favorite artists and we tell you when theyre coming to town
- Start with the current idea of people interact with the world in this way from their specific entity that they take to stores ect.. The internet reverses that by creating these siloed areas where you have a fragmented personality that emerges to become you so one is one box at the bottom with a bunch of boxes over it then the other of the internet is the boxes flipped with thousands at the bottom and one on top for every one. We are flipping this to give power to the people who deserve it not the platforms but the people. You are fully yourself and you get to pick yourself up and own yourself and take yourself everywhere which traditionally was that these people owned what you thought was you now you own yourself and interact one level of abstraction above it
- Another important part of a retreat is the physical environment you are in.  We are constantly running and doing things.  We don’t really get a chance to step back and think.  Even if we do for, maybe we get five minutes or ten minutes.  In that short time, we can’t really explore ourselves that deeply.  No meaningful relationship was formed 5 minutes at a time.  Some of us rarely even get those 5 minutes.  We are constantly pumping information into our head eyes and ears.  When was the last time you were in a public space like a grocery store or gym that didn’t have music.  We constantly feel like we need to feed our brains because when we let them sit still for a second, we start to realize there’s deeper things there.  These deeper things create fear within us and we can’t fully explore those deeper questions and inner thoughts, so we run from them.  A retreat allows us to step outside of our body and outside of the life that we live to explore ourselves, explore our lives, and explore the world and our place in it.  People have some of their best ideas when they are forced to sit alone without any external expectations or stimulus.  A common place this happens is in the shower one of the last great refuges of solitude and shower thoughts can be some of our most insightful moments.  Going on a retreat gives us a better sense of that path we are on and allows us to ask if it is the right path.  We can ask who are we and what life should we be living. Assuming you want to take a dive into the depths of your soul, if even for a couple days, how should you even look at going on a retreat?
  I believe there are three steps you need to have a successful retreat.  The one caveat is that a successful retreat could be done in two days or need months. Also, a successful retreat doesn’t solve all your problems, but it allows you to try to identify them, so you can take the steps to work on them. There are no silver bullets in life.  Retreats provide an incredible amount of helpful perspective to inform the decisions and actions you take in your life, but any change must come from thoughtful purposeful actions.
  So what are the three steps? Step one cut a hole in a box. All kidding aside three steps are regroup, digest, and plan. There is no right way to go about these, but I would suggest putting away your phone, going to a place without any Internet, trying to be in nature and/or meditate and generally sit still and not take any new information.  We are constantly bombarded with new information and you do not want to flood your head with new things because this will sit on top and block out what wants to come up. The goal isn’t to change its to understand yourself better, so sit down and relax.  The quiet allows you to realize what the deep down inner you may have been trying to tell you for some time, but it could not get a word in because of the screaming from your life constantly entering your head. Furthermore, the only person who knows what you want to here is you.  It is almost counter intuitive that you need to try really hard at doing nothing because you are just about giving yourself the space and the time to let those thoughts come from deep in your head to the front of your brain.  That comes with giving your mind space and allowing yourself to think.  Create an environment of intentional boardem this creates the initial conditions for listening to yourself and then you must actively listen.  This comes through mindfulness and investigate, however works best for you.  It is probably best to write thing down when they come up and constantly have a little notebook and pen with you because you never know when that insight will come up.  For me, it often happens on hikes when I am in nature listening to the forest then some thought peaks in from the back of my head.  You do not want to hold these thoughts with you and have them monopolize your thought you want to give the full range of your perception time to show itself.
    - **Note:** Writing this down ensures that what you say is not forgotten and allows you to clear your mind or allows you to double down and really dig into the topic on your mind and explore it fully right in front of you.  Putting your thoughts down allows a different and deeper level of examination of your thoughts and leaves bad thinking and bad self-talk no place to hide.  The goal is insight which can come anywhere anytime and we must set the table and invite insight into our minds and life. 
      Step one, the regroup. Life is fast and amazing and there’s so much going on all the time.  We get in a routine and life happens to us.  Things go great other things go horribly wrong, but there is so much constantly going on.  We are constantly doing something going from work, to time with friends to TV and while you’re watching TV casual entertainment on social media.  We as a species have filled whatever “free time” we might have with everything under the sun by silence and rest. It is not like reading a book is much different.  In essence it is very similar experience because you’re blocking your natural thoughts from bubbling up. Were constantly going we are a species of constant progress. That instinct drove us from living in caves sitting around fires to the moon, but we have far surpassed the golden mean of optimal progress orientation to the determent of that progress we yearn for. We have so much to fill our time. Too much.  The world is moving so fast and we want to move fast with it; we do not want to have any FOMO. It’s exciting. It’s fun to be on the treadmill of society, but when you get to your retreat you need to step off and the first thing you must do is catch your breath and regroup. Make sure you’re rested make sure you’re recovered. The anxious and busy mind breeds little authentic thoughts.  You need to make sure you’re mine is in a place to receive yourself. If that requires you to sleep for an entire 24 hours that successful first day.  If you sleep for 48 hours, that is a successful first two days.  You need to reset your mind and fully regroup from the constancy of life. Phones may be one of the best inventions or connection and knowledge democratization ever invented, but they are not made to bring solace. We are at our core an incredibly social species who need connection.  Resisting these urges is a tall task and you need to create an environment conducive to vibrant internal conversation.  You must put away your phone and limit your social interaction.  You need to sit there with yourself long enough to wonder who you really are. The first step is just positioning yourself to receive what your body wants to tell you. If you were to leave having just accomplish a brief moment of connection with yourself, it is an incredibly successful retreat.  With life moving so fast and constantly punching you in the face and shaking you every which way even just screwing your head on straight and facing the day with the wholeness of your being is success.  Transcendence is a straight line with a non-linear path, but if you can reach the next level of your connection you can reach step two.
- I used to hear the universe more clearly and thought I lost touch with it but clearly when I thought it was lost it just spoke to me in a different verse. Previously things seemed obvious animalistic even. Crying all the time broken and struggling. Losing love but finding so much more in its wake. Being faced with challenges and having to grow up only to realize I was an adult the entire time. Thinking I am a loser when the entire world was telling me I was much better than that. Having to verbalize my feelings to myself only to realize they were wrong. After years of never being enough and never getting there, we got there and I was at the center of it. After having a great year I started to struggle I was moved from 1 where I had hit all year to 5 but I felt myself finding my flow more and more. Then first AB against the pitcher we could never hit with a man on first I line a triple to left scores one I score the next batter completely changed the game. I was once again the hero in my own journey in the wider story. I also sat so people could play more defense I happily sacrificed and remained positive was the first out of the dugout I felt like a leader that game and that season and winning when you felt like the one in charge is amazing. I played pretty much every position on the field hit for power and average came into my own. It was great. Then though I had to listen to the universe speaking a different language to me. The language was so previously clear that I was enough that in every opportunity in my bounded world I was more than I realized. The next step was now I had to step outside this bubble and bet on myself to be bold and believe in and believe in myself. The vacation I took was a Seminole moment I was with my grandma and I was experience the best and truest love I have ever had. This was when I decided to bet big on WIF. On this boat, then on the flight home I was looking into more things and I found these AI meme coins and I took the world with 2 arms. I have probably made my entire yearly salary on the side just through pivoting to these things. I thought I was done listening to the universe but all I realized was now the plan and game was different and I had seamlessly adjusted without even realizing it. I am still listening to the universe very deeply and I need to be proud of that. I realized the season of my life had changed from recovery to financial gain and I jumped at it taking advantage of all the work I did. I laid in wait for 2 years watching listening waiting until I finally saw something that made sense. I bought virtuals at 45 cents. Then everything got crazy from there. I have continued to listen to the universe when I thought I forgot I have continued on my heros journey when I thought I was thrown off of it. Now I continue into the unknown the mystic. This is proof then when I am asking tough questions about one area of my life another area asserts itself as more important. Right now I am adjusting to a new girlfriend and apartment. I want to make career moves but I must trust and listen to the universe not make any crazy steps but only move with logic with purpose and with focus. The issue is I am hearing the call and just not realizing the words I am hearing is the call. I continue on my journey a braver man. A more complete person and I must continue to believe be patiently inpatient with myself. I must relax and be calm. I must realize I am on my own hero’s journey I have answered the call and I continue to answer the call and I cannot force the path that journey takes me. I can only listen the best I can to the universe and trust in my ability to execute on the plan of my life. I will continue to exercise courage and trust myself and the universe. I need to retain the deep confidence and belief in myself and understand that everything I have done has served this person I have become. I even ran a half marathon and it was really just easy. I need to believe I have an invented crisis of meaning but in reality the picture has never been more clear or obvious. The plan is laid out the step I am taking are fully aligned and in tune this is the rest of my life I have in front of me and I need to bring back the positivity and whimsical nature that I have lost into who I am now continue to love and fight and work to become who I am the person I know I can be and just trust
- Time
  Time is one of those funny things because it’s always moving, but it never feels like it passes. We’re born we live and we die, but we always experience just the present moment. Despite the movement of time, the world just stays static to us. We are changing constantly but so invested in our current state that these minute changes never register in our minds. The changes prove too small to reshape our self concept significantly. This is true in all areas of life. The small and big changes never feel like they happen. Life just seems to pass while remaining unchanged. We never feel time and transformation through it because transformation is a process not an event. Change is cemented before it happens. No one gets married or divorced on a whim. Those are the product of every small interaction leading up to the big decision point. The event just formalizes the internal journey to finally be reflected in the outside world.
  While the event of a break up or new job can be jarring in the moment, we never are fully surprised. The adjustment is mainly situational. The alignment of internal feelings and external situation is the last step on a transformation process. The physical situational change is often the hardest and simplest step. We are forced to make a decision in response to a complex question. Often, a question devoid of an answer. The next step is just taken. This is often the hardest because we grow up being taught that the world is about clear growth. Charted paths. Questions and answers. Then one day we realize life is not a series of questions and answers, but choices and consequences. Paths chosen and paths avoided. Time creates inflection points that position us at divergent roads. We must deviate from the previously straight and simple path we were on. We must decide what is best. There is not right answer. Further we can never free ourself from the nagging counterfactual that will arise. A door that leads to a completely different unexplored life that will never exist except within the doubts and reaffirming thoughts in your mind. Real world decisions are devoid of grades. The path not traveled will never be explored. The counter factual never exists outside of our heads.
  Even the seemingly shocking decisions are never out of the realm of possibility because every decision we make is rooted in one core truth. Life is finite and our allotted time is unknown. All change is pushed forward by the inevitable march of time. Time is the single most important feature in everyone’s life. Religion is the most foundational human institution because it addresses the most uncomfortable questions that come with time. How much time do we have. What should we do with that time. What happens when our times runs out. Time is the one thing we have no agency over. People have long searched for a fountain of youth with no success. Still, humans will never give up that search because the ability to unlock more time is the single most important thing we can do in life. Every decision becomes infinitely less important when we no longer have to account for time. We specialize in a career because we do not have time to learn everything. Monogamy is a function of finite time and the passing of time. We must raise the next generation. We must replace ourselves. Every decision is made with the ultimate knowledge and acceptance of our death. Death is the only thing that truly pushes us to transform and live.
  Life itself is a continuous transformation process. Each day we trade small incremental change for our finite time. This trade is forced. Every day we are getting a bit older, likely against our will. Every person prefers life to death. No matter, the time is being taken regardless of how we feel. Knowing we cannot barter for more time with the grim reaper we must default to our next best option. Using that time to make the most of our life. We implicitly accept this, but fail to really grasp it. We are changing so much, but the change is at such a small scale we never fully register it’s happening. Then one day you wake up. You’re just so much older than you think you are. The world has changed, so much around you and you’re still thinking it’s 2015 but in reality, it’s a decade later. The only thought you really can muster is what the fuck happened.
  One of the great ironies of life, I guess. We know the world is changing. We know we are changing, but were so invested in our life that most of the change flies over our heads. Everyone can generally accept the argument above about change, but when the change is happening to you in your life that change is just really tough to reason. One day we’re running around the playground playing tag in third grade then were in high school. We will never be that little kid again.
  But somehow we are always that little kid. Were also forced to change. To transform. To evolve, but the past sticks with us. A faint memory of times gone by. Memories gained. Time lost. Laughs had. Pain endured. Time passes, but we remain a construction and reflection of our past. We’re always that little kid running around on the playground playing tag. We are the shy kid on our first day of school. The kid who failed this test. The degree which we change while somehow remaining a living artifact of our past is what makes life such a beautiful mosaic. No matter how old we get that little kid in us will never die. Those past experiences will remain. The world may mature us and make us look haggard and feel achy. The world makes us feel like we have to do certain things and be a certain person. But even when we are deep in that swamp of expectation with our mind covered by the monotony of the daily grind one small moment could change that. Transform us. Transport us back to another time when everything seemed so simple. Those simple days. We long for them, but seem to be at most a memory and possibly a fantasy. Whether it’s the enchantment of a time before modern technology with a picket fence and fire place, or a time in your life when you felt like you captured lightning in a bottle. That one summer or senior year. When everything felt simpler because it was simpler. The friends and experiences you had back then can never be recreated. Lost to time and eventually to memory. The people lost. Best friends who became acquittances. True loves who became bitter exes. But also the amazing moments, the chance encounter that brought an old friend back in your life. The awkward first date with your wife. Life has a funny way of making us feel like all the good days are behind us when we will look back at where we are now and realize every moment embeds a cherished memory. We stand in front as the little kid that has grown so much masked by the guise of experience and that will always be true.
  Time is a funny thing. The world remains stagnant only experience the present despite always being in motion. We just experience this one current moment, but that moment is always changing. Much like the paradox that says if you cut the distance in half continuously you can never reach the destination, our life changes despite always being in the present moment. So it does feel weird to have the sense that you’ve always been in this one present moment yet your life is so radically different than it once was. Further that life will be unrecognizable in 6 months and 6 years. We never feel we change, but we have no choice to accept it. Time is too short. Change is an essential part of life. We must embrace our dynamic ever changing life. We do not have the time nor the ability to resist it.
  Change is one of those things that just exists as itself regardless of our feelings toward it. Much in the way the sun does not care if you want it to shine change does not care if you want it or not. Change is coming. Change is happening. Our feelings do not matter. Change is uncomfortable for everyone. No one loves discomfort, but change doesn’t care. We are constantly changing regardless of how we feel. We must consciously embrace change. This ma
    - **Note:** This mandates us to act before we are ready.  Change waits for no one.  Waiting to embrace change puts you behind.  No one has been ready for significant change.  Despite not being ready we must embraced the change when it presented.  No matter that accepting that will lead to constant failure.  Failure is the necessary, and painful, precondition of learning.  No one has ever been ready for change. 
      Being ready for change is like writing a letter to Santa or wetting your pants on a cold day.  It may make you feel warm inside, but its not helping your cause.  Ready isn’t a simple concept.  Being optimally ready is acting 6 months to a year before you feel it’s really time.   Do not think this is you.  Anyone who has done anything hard to accomplished anything of substance big or small has done it for the first time without any training.  Washington first war as general was the revolution.  No one gets to pretend to be a parent for 5 years before they have responsibility.  You didn’t do 5th grade 3 times until you perfected it.  You moved onto 6th grade despite being a barely literate uncomfortable pre-teen.   Take comfort in knowing that if you feel absolutely clueless when taking the next step you’re exactly where most people are.  No one is ever really that ready.  The version of you at the end of the journey would laugh and the hubris of your readiness at the beginning. 
      That’s the beautiful thing about life.  No one is every ready.  Most people are clueless taking locally novel action, but how could they be ready?  How can you have experience of knowledge in something you’ve never done.  You cant.  You just have to pretend, hope, and try your best.  That is what everyone does and humanity has made it pretty far on those basic premises.  This works for 2 reasons.  One ignorance is bliss and humans are an optimistic species.  It can never be THAT hard and when were struggling we believe we can figure it out because were pretty smart and have no other choice but to do so anyways.  We have no other choice because we just don’t have that much time.  We will be dead soon.  We are in a rush to jam as much life we can into the finite time we have. 
      Accepting failure isn’t an option.  Immediate failure is what paves the way to long term success.  While were alive, we must believe were ready to succeed or at least give it our best shot.  This is scary.  Novelty is tricky, but so what do it scared.  May be the only chance to do it at all.  True failure is the result of never have failed.  Never putting yourself in the uncomfortable position to reach for success.  Those who reach for success aren’t omniscient gods.  They know that striving for success means accepting failure and they just accept that. 
      Tolerating uncertainty is the thing rewarded most by society.  Time is the most uncertain thing because it forces us to be 3 places at once but feel stuck in the moment.  Strive for the future.  Grow from our past.  All the while being present in every moment.  We admire children for their ability to be focused and joyous in the moment.  We look back on those days wanting to get back to that state or feeling, but that childlike joy is very different from the integration of time we experience as adults.  A full integration of past presence and future in one person is the highest calling of humanity.  The ability to look at everyone and see these three different aspects of their life is what allows humans to truly understand someone. 
      Looking at someone in the moment is like reading one page in a book.  It gives you a ton of information, but no context.  Time is such a tricky character because of how much the present is shaped by the past and the future.  Often sacrificed.  True presence requires the understanding of past and future.  The climax of a book takes on a completely different meaning when you read everything before and predict everything after it instead of just opening the book to a random page.  Until we see the scared kid and future CEO, were blind to the meaning behind present action.  The concept of presence is vital to happiness, but presence is not something manifested in the moment, but constructed over time.  Being present with ourself requires an integration of time not the disregard of it.  The present is just the future minus the past.  Where we want to go and how far we have gotten so far.  The effects of that journey shape who we are.  The past both propels and weighs on us.  Action is inextricably linked to past and future in a way that is inseparable from the now. 
      When we look at ourselves and others we must realize how much this equation of presence governs every decision.  Why is someone friendly or cold.  Happy or sad.  Our life is defined by our hope for the future and confidence in that future through the achievements of our past that give us the demeanor we have in the present.  We know this is true for us and we feel it viscerally, but the human condition is consistent across the specieis.  We must realize everyone feels this way.  Everyone is driven by their triumphs and traumas.  Hopes and fears.  That’s the beauty and challenge of life.
      To truly see someone in the moment, we must see them in time.  We realize everyone is just as scared and clueless and confused as the rest of us.  When we look deeply into someone soul, we see the kid they once were.  Look even deeper and see why they aren’t fully that innocent child anymore.  While time remains a burden and limitation, constraints create innovation.  Time is a gift that fires us forward.  Realizing we must do because we soon wont be able to.  Time does not care what you think about it.  Time ticks with each moment marking our soul.  That leaves us with one option.  To take the responsibility to mark it well.
