### Highlights

- The Key to Balenciaga: The Story of Isa and her Astonishing Sewing Skill
  Summary:
  Isa's remarkable sewing skill was the key to Balenciaga's success.
  At age three and a half, Isa, a dressmaker, taught the women in her village, including Balenciaga, how to sew. Balenciaga showed extraordinary talent from a young age, akin to prodigies like Tiger Woods and Mozart.
  He dedicated 74 years to the industry, sewing every day until he retired.
  His commitment to sewing daily for decades reflects the undervalued importance of being prolific, as mentioned in Paul Graham's essay and emphasized in the book 'Creators'.

- Christian Dior: Standing Out and Defying Austerity
  Summary:
  Industry-specific talent clusters in physical locations where the best subcontractors are located, which was crucial for Christian Dior's success in using high-quality materials.
  Dior's uniqueness stemmed from his rejection of wartime austerity and his approach of standing out rather than fitting in. Despite facing multiple failures early in his career, Dior's success was propelled by his use of precious materials and defiance of societal norms.
  The foundation of the Dior empire, starting from Christian Dior's father's fertilizer factory, highlights the unexpected origins of his success and the eventual connection to the LVMH empire established by Bernardo Knoll.

    - **Note:** After WW2 end people are looking for something new and fresh to turn the page and Dior comes in fresh and provides a completely counter positioned style to the austerity times of war this is a prime moment to launch something and he takes advantage. Dior was an artist but in a quick span his dad lost his entire business in the depression his mom died and his brother is committed to an insane asylum. This is his darkest time but provides him the launching pad for his career. Opportunity is a strange beast appears when you’re least expecting. This moment is when his growth is at its highest. Make yourself a big target for luck as you need luck in any successful endeavor. In his mid 40s he was just an average fashion designer, but he meets busacc who is a textile producer who wants to open a fashion house. Dior comes to him with an ambitious plan to be the best. Dior didn’t want a fashion house he wanted to go for great hiring the best most talented people and spending a lot of money deep commitment greatness doesn’t come cheap or without sacrifice and he was demanding this with basically no track record.
