### Highlights

- He had no ambition to be a deep researcher in any field he thought he was going to be a school teacher learned what he was interested in and ended up have keep knowledge across 10+ fields just by following interest. Very cross disciplinary and synthesized and went deep. Then became a philosopher as a result of all these interests coming together. Enjoyed philosophical problems as a kid. He didn’t think he could be a philosopher didn’t think he had the chops. Wanted to do something practical and went into cabinet making. He develops his theories by getting acquainted with a subject and gets fascinated with a problem then he starts to think intensely and problem crystallizes comes up with a tentative solution then maybe the problem evolves sometimes he writes it down and sometimes he forgets it. He wrote the open society and it’s enemies 22 times before publishing to continue to simplify it. For logic of scientific discovery he was still working as a school teacher. He cut the book in half and had worked on the idea for 15 years before publishing. Some ideas took 46 years to publish. Worked on theory of knowledge and philosophy of science. Popper had a very non linear track to being a philosopher but his scientific view of Marxism and his random teaching on the side to make extra money formed his priors that lead him to being a great philosopher just follow your interests and eventually you’ll get where you’re going can’t connect the dots looking forward. He then was told to write a book so he did and went well fled hitler to England and got a job in philosophy then the problems he studied that he was interested in carved this path for him. Studied problems then eventually became a major philosopher. Never decided to study anything. Study problems not fields. Look for problems you can dedicate your life to and constantly improve and criticize your answer before releasing it. No solutions are final all solutions are fallible. Every solution opens the door to a deeper problem. Truth is objective but we are fallible.

    - **Note:** you can't connect the dots looking forward popper didnt want to be a philosopher he studied cross disciplinary fields and eventually settled in philosophy after many years. He enjoyed studying problems some of which took decades for him to actually publish. He was always writing and rewriting. Study problems not fields and follow your unique differentiation and what gives you energy
- Cynical approach to history that greed drives human nature. There was first the view that history consists of racial struggles. The Marxist view which says history consists not of racist but class struggles. Said the producers had all the power not the owner class. When that class is overthrown then there will be peace. So socialism must come about but you must deal with the negatives to get the positives. There is a view that oppression and conditions are worse in better countries like the us because the people are more greedy. Active optimism not Passive cynicism is the answer we must actively make the world better. Optimism about the present activism to shape the future. Cynics say we are to clever for our own good we invent nukes but want to blow everyone up. Popper says we are too good and too stupid as to be swayed easily by bad theories morally not criticizing them. The future is open and there are headwinds but also growth opportunities for the future. Optimism for the future should give us hope. The future is open and we should be actively optimistic. Political freedom is always a struggle from despots. Ideologies can make good men to very evil things. We must fight for freedom constantly in times. The us is in a constantly fight for freedom to become a better world idealism coupled with tolerance and desire to help and learn active and practical experiment. Loves the USA. Marx sees capitalism as exploiting workers but objective it’s getting better for workers since the conditions at the start of the industrial revolution and when the communist took over there wasn’t 1 class but just a new ruling class. Marx capitalism is bad science. Extremely non violent and wants to wage a war for peace against violence. Despise fashion and get a bit more responsible each day.

    - **Note:** He argues for active optimism constantly and life is a constant fight and push for our political freedoms we must always fight for freedom. Believes Marx is wrong as it’s just a power game communism and socialism not a progress game but Marx was right to increase the lives of the workers. Creating knowledge is the only way to grow but love for your fellow man is important too.
      Cynical approach to history sees the world in some constant struggle not the beautiful dance of creation life actually is. Create and love life is a dance of complexity.
- We are objectively getting better in life circumstances but also getting stupider. We are struggling to learn from our mistakes. Error correction is a vital method within learning and evolution. Mistakes and correction are needed to learn. All life is problem solving and all organisms are inventors and technicians trying to solve problems. Critique of tech if vital but techno pessimism is death. Freedom should only be restricted when necessary which is subjective because there’s a gray line between good and bad it’s subjective. Technology can help existing industries grow like the steam engine or the major human inventions like language. Helping existing industries do something better but exist in the same paradigm while others like cars change the fundamental way of life and invent or usher in new paradigms.

    - **Note:** Error correction is vital in any developing system but tech is linear and human emotions are cyclical. Organisms are constantly problem solving and learning we can only grow through creation of knowledge and must remain both optimistic of growth and critical of it.
      Tech growth can be a sustaining innovation of a paradigm shifting one.
      Good and bad are subjective so freedom should rarely be restricted
- Government is Democratic if the leaders and be removed without bloodshed. Government can be democratic even with a monarchy and isn’t just rule of the people. The 2 party system is best because it allows clear voting for one or the other idea then it’s implementation. Proportional representation doesn’t allow clear views and experiments and can lead to tyranny of the minority so while it’s most representative maybe it’s not best or most democratic. Democracy is the majority power of dismissal not rule of the people. Two party system might be better if both parties are good because they allow clearer experimentation vs the proportional representation. The losing party needs to keep the winning party honest and defend and make sure the winners are tolerant of the other ideologies of the losers. Ideologies that are intolerant lose their right to be tolerated. World views shouldn’t be encompassed in parties political parties are too narrow a framing on a world view small affinity parties are bad and so are party politics and outsourced thinking.
    - **Tags:** #government, #compromise-is-bad-because-good-explanations-are-rare, #systems-thinking, #2-party-system, #politics, #outsourced-thinking, #tyranny-of-the-minority
    - **Note:** A two-party system is better than proportional representation because the two-party system allows for clear implementation of ideas while proportional representation creates tyranny of the minority. Losing party balances and comes up with new ideas so the winning party stays honest the entire system grows. World views shouldn’t be encompassed in political parties. Parties are downstream from world view.
- Freedom is engrained in the brittish and Swiss culture but one comes from farmers the other from prodestant and class struggles. It’s a philosophers duty to understand the zietgeist and mitigate the biases of it ti think independently. We shouldn’t be products of our intellectual dogma but use the critical approach to free ourselves to think for ourselves. Self emancipation through knowledge we can think for ourselves grown men don’t need leaders or profits. We should make clear and rational arguments because that exposes them to criticism not confusing backwards ones that’s why he praises Bertrand Russell ego made very clear arguments. Don’t be a subject of a dogma. We need a freedom of thought in the world and thus we need democracy and institutions to allow the free and open conjecture and criticism of ideas. Thales of Miletus came up with a school that didn’t pass the founders ideas down as dogmas but allowed and encouraged criticism which was then passed down of it contained deep truth start of conjecture and criticism. Freedom and democracy is the ability to change the government without bloodshed but through peaceful means. Our western democracies aren’t perfect but they’re the best thing we’ve invented so far and we should appreciate that but still try to improve. Freedom of opportunity doesn’t mean equality in outcome people still fail in free states but the feeling of being free is great. Freedom is guaranteed to be successful many revolutions for freedom have been crushed but it’s the only system worth living under. Freedom allows us the full responsibility for ourselves but doesn’t guarantee us success that’s subject to our actions.

    - **Note:** We need to mitigate the biases of the culture. We belong in and think for ourselves to realize the truth. Popper argues the truth is mitigating dogma, creating good explanations and exposing them to criticism to make them better. Freedom and open conjecture. Freedom vs equality they aren’t the same thing. Democracy best so far good government is switched without bloodshed
- Kepler looks for truth behind appearance. Truth seeking looking for harmony of world. There is harmony in the world through schrodingers uncertainty that was posited by keplers metaphysics. Resonance and harmony and dissonance govern the world. Metaphysics comes from appearances but when we start testing it vs experience it becomes conjecture and science. We need bold conjectures and questionable ideas because the truth isn’t obvious so we must seek crazy solutions then test them.

    - **Note:** Look for deep truths that show harmony in the world. Bold conjectures and criticism then testing them vs experience
- Animals have knowledge unconscious to them and humans likewise have this and this is displayed through expectations. There is truth in our knowledge but little certainty. We should be respectful and keep heavy skepticism of our ideas. Truth is objective certainty is rarely objective it’s just a strong feeling of trust based based on insufficient knowledge that leads to dogmatism. Certainty is unavailable. Experts are sometimes mistaken. There are experts but no authority we are all fallible. There is short term knowledge like changing how you see something then adjusting or long term knowledge that allows you to survive in a niche. We core everything through our mental models. Were never perfectly adjusted to our environment so we’re all fallible. Theories come before the data. New theories come from new problems which is why it’s easy to see problems but new and good theories are rare. The invention of the eye takes the idea of light from the outside world being useful. New universal structure. Creates momentary adaptation to the environment. Theories are trials. All organisms are problem solvers and finders. Critical approach critical in the pursuit of objective truth. Criticize theories and compare to facts. We can only learn from facts

    - **Note:** we display unconscious knowledge through expectations but this doesnt mean truth just our best guesses about reality. Truth exists but we may not reach it given we are fallible. Epistemic vs social confidence. Knowledge is something that exists within a niche. Use the critical approach and create theories that help us better adapt to our environment. Truth is rarely objective.
- All knowledge is conjectural a priori and then conjectured and tested. Knowledge is not a result of perception, but knowledge creates perception. Our goals and desires determine our perceptions then we go about testing those interpretations. Beings are actively testing their assumptions about the world through trial and error asking questions of the outside world and weighing and adapting to the response. Our knowledge is hidden in our expectations. We cannot certain knowledge only conjectural knowledge. 3 big ideas We know nothing with certainty so we should be very modest we should not claim to know when we don’t know

    - **Note:** All knowledge is based on conjectures and refutations crating our perceptions and models. We have models and constantly test them and see how they hold up. Knowledge is fallible. Knowledge is hidden in expectations
- Popper lost 16 family members to hitler some in auchwitz. All knowledge is conjecture nothing is certain but we can attain theories that are more or less true and we should push for these. Search for and correct errors. The world is good viewing it negatively to be trendy is stupid. Animals have a mental state and can communicate through signals. Humans can communicate through representation of facts and reality which is a level deeper. The ability for humans to represent facts is key to conjecture and criticism. This breeds uncertainty which is uncomfortable so humans invent and attach to dogma. Belief proceeds achievement we can’t live in a good world until we start to have a positive attitude toward it and not believe it’s a hell. We should have more uncertainty in the world and less strict ideology where we adopt beliefs. Think for yourself don’t outsource beliefs.

    - **Note:** All knowledge is conjectural and humans have the ability to represent facts and understand them at a deeper level through conjecture and criticism. This breeds uncertainty which humans hate so they outsource beliefs and create dogma this is bad on't do that think for yourself
      Humans communicate through mental models and conjecture remain actively optimistic even though pessimism sounds smarter its suboptimal
      humans hate being wrong. Humans communicate through their mental models.
      Think for yourself remain critical choose happiness and active optimism.
- There is a world of physical bodies a world of the mind and then a 3rd world of the products of the mind like theories. A skyscraper is in world one but the product of world 3. There are things unique to all worlds and interplay between the 2 and undiscovered theory is in world 3. A theory known but not published is in world 2 of the scientist and world 3. Then there are purely physical objects. There’s 4 arguments around this. Mind body interaction mind body parallelism ie the mind and body exist separate from each other and run together. Then purely physical or mental world. Because theories in world 3 from world 2 effect world 1 this rejects parallelism. World 3 is innately human and goes back to the old fisherman’s tales and fables but is structural similar to our ideas of science now. Self consciousness is in world 3.

    - **Note:** 3 worlds physical mental and the product of physical and mental to create new things. People would reject the 3rd world as mind body dualism but this is really the mind and area of creativity where everything is discovered. Creating complexity and the meaning of life
- We learn through trial and error. We see an anomaly use trial and error to conjecture answers then eliminate what doesn’t work or make sense until we have one that does. Science starts from problems not observations. The key aspect of science is conscious application of the critical method. Previous conjectures were evolutionary and sought to be validated now we seek to disprove our conjectures to grow our knowledge base. We don’t validate thought processes but conclusion. Science is the critical approach of criticizing and falsifying beliefs constantly as a default. Start with problems then critical approach 2 steps then new problems. We learn through falsification and falsification is a scientific success. Science grew from critical discussion. Good science must be falsifiable if it can never be proved wrong it isn’t science. We seek to make bold conjectures because that allows us to learn more with lower probability predictions. Better predictions predict more things are false. Saying there are no white ravens predicts less than saying there are only black ravens because that rules out every other color

    - **Note:** Science starts with problems and application of critical approach, make falsifiable low probability predictions that are more specific. We want to prove ourselves wrong. Bold conjectures
- The greatest intellectual giants toiled for many years and as a result we’re able to realize and understand the world better than anyone had to that point they faced dogma and superstition head on and conquered it by understanding the world deeper. Progress is social or moral and can both be achieved or hampered by humanity. It’s our duty to move it forward not backwards.
    - **Tags:** #progress-over-sustainability, #support-for-others, #progress-(from-wrong-to-less-wrong), #initial-conditions, #dogma-(resist-it)
    - **Note:** Human progress is both social and moral but not inevitable it is our job to create the initial conditions to drive progress. Progress was created by brave men who stood in the face of dogma.
