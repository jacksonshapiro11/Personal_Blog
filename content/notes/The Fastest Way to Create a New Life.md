  Life, where whenever I write a newsletter or a video script or a book, whatever it may be in cortex, this is why we have cortex capture is because when I'm on a walk or when I'm having conversations Or when I'm just thinking, all of my ideas magnetize towards that thing. That's how you notice ideas in reality is by having a project to apply those ideas to. If you don't have the project or the goal, so many ideas and opportunities are passing you by because your mind doesn't care about those things. It's not signaling. There's no dopamine signaling for the survival of that project. Now, the thing with life is that it's not just like a book. It's not a book that comes to an end. It's an infinite story that you continue writing until your demise. So remember that, is that you don't just achieve a goal and stop because the story hasn't ended yet. That's simply just a chapter in the story. You have to write a new chapter. These goals aren't final peaks on the mountain because once you reach that mountain peak, you see finally that there's another one, but you can only see the other one once you reach the First one. So how do we start making progress toward these goals? The one-year goal, 10-year goal, vision, anti-vision, etc. It's with projects. So that's what we need to do is invest energy into a series of projects. I say that specifically because you aren't interested in a project until you invest energy into it. The other thing is that you don't learn skills. You build projects. Skills, like degrees, are practically useless in isolation. A series of projects is how you move toward the life you want. If you want to receive, you must give, and keeping your knowledge in your head is a surefire way to become bitter about how smart you are and how little people care. A project is a quest in your game. The more you build, the more experience you put into your traits, profession, character, and abilities. When you build a project, you learn relevant techniques that allow you to solve a problem and achieve a specific result. Now, we're not going to go over how to structure a project here with things like milestones and levers and tasks and deadlines because you understand what a project is. It's something that you create. It's something that you build. It's something that allows you to pursue an interest-based education because you need to learn in order to build the project. But the thing here is that your project must be a stepping stone toward your vision. It must solve the problem that we initially came up with, with how you aren't content with your life. That's a project. If it's your body, then the project is going to the gym. Your project is your body. So as a quick example, if you struggle with money, that's a problem. From there, you fabricate a project to build in alignment with the example vision of having a successful business with the constraint of working four hours a day so you have the time For your family or relationships. That drastically narrows what kind of project you will build. But the thing here is if you aren't in the right environment, then you won't notice this as an option, right? You struggle with money, but you're not in the right environment. You don't have the right beliefs. The opportunities aren't in that environment. Then you're not going to notice something like starting a one-person business as an opportunity. ([TimeÂ 0:21:51](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f78d2b8d-6f31-4c9f-877f-44aaf94ff994))
