### Highlights

- managers ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hss4tky9xj8nv85ws5b0yxr0))
- Customer demand  Good product managers listen to customers but they probe deeper into the underlying problems to get at the compelling value proposition for the customer. If you had a noisy car you might ask for a louder stereo, but you would probably be a lot happier with a quieter car. A good product manager gets at that difference. Good product managers also know what customers can & will pay for (sometimes that's slightly different than what they want).
   Good product managers do quantitative research.
   Good product managers are certain that if they build a certain product, customers will buy it. Good product managers understand that if they screw this up, they might as well pack it in so they go the extra mile to make sure they get this right.

- Bad product managers miss the big picture or miss small but important factors. Bad product managers build a good product for a market their company isn't in. Bad product managers build a product that's too complex for their company to sell. Bad product managers build a product that will take too long to pay off. Bad product managers ask customers leading questions and get biased answers. Bad product managers go on their instinct and "confirm" it with two unusual customers. Bad product managers react only to the moves of their competitors and forget to develop their own product's identity, letting it be just a hodge podge of what the competition is not doing. Bad product managers aren't savvy or confident enough to distinguish between interest and commitment to buy. Bad product managers blindly listen to the loudest customers, and define a product that addresses yesterday's needs of a handful of companies. Bad product managers compare future products to today's competition, or cite advantages customers don't care about. Bad product managers try to defend their lack of knowledge rather than gain the knowledge. Bad product managers have blinders on and don't notice when things change and notice only when their product fails. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsrgwdt53kvm261j8nwkme4s))
    - **Note:** bad product managers think they are smarter and better than the situation instead of being humble playing the game on the field and growing with it
- One of the most important - if not the most important - job for a product manager is to define clearly and in as much detail as is necessary what the product should do, how fast it should be, etc. Good product managers don't forget to specify critical information. Good product managers err on the side of clarity and are willing to explain the obvious to make sure it's understood. Good product managers also specify the whole product, including release criteria, platforms, etc., not only the new features. Good product managers also sense and tackle hard issues - in writing - early in the development process.
  o Note a good product definition does not come down from a product manager in an ivory tower, but is based on research, information and a logical, transparent thought process that the entire team buys into.
   Good product managers know that engineers are scientists by nature and value data much more than opinion. Also, engineering and other parts of PD (QA, Doc, etc.) should be involved in that process. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsrhfab0rq5xv4dfz745rvn4))
    - **Note:** Good product managers define the why can ground it in science
