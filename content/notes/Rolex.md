### Highlights

- **Hans Wilsdorf's Early Life.** After his parents' death, Hans Wilsdorf's uncles sold the family business to send him to boarding school. He’s an outsider grows up an orphan. Decides to go to Switzerland and gets into the watch trade. The industry wasnt wrist watches which weren’t invented yet. Hans works for the import export as a secretary and he’s multi lingual so he’s answer letters all day. He’s getting to know both the manufacturers of watches and the buyers so he’s getting a wholistic view of the industry. Hans is obsessed with quality and does tests on the watches he’s importing eventually getting them certified by scientific lab to show quality. Watches were massive at this time as time keeping was becoming vital it was the phone of its day. Also people played with it in lines. Hans at 22 moves to England to work for a watch company then at 24 goes out on his own with capital from a man who became his brother in law. Currently at that time watches were imported from manufacturers then branded by retailers. Hans uses his knowledge of importing to create the best watch.

  He's like, oh, great, Switzerland seems like a good place. I'm going to go live there when I graduate, which he does. He moves to Geneva, and he finds work there first for a large pearl merchant. So this business was buying like raw pearls from fishermen and then selling them to the famous Swiss jewelers there in Geneva. And then he joins another local trading company in a adjacent industry to the jewelry business, a firm called Kuno Corten. Kuno Corten, turns out, isn't in just any industry. As far as Switzerland goes, they are in the industry, besides banking. They are in the watch trade. Well, you need something to bank. Yeah, you need something to bank. Exactly.
  David Rosenthal
  A country can't just have banking as an industry.
  Ben Gilbert
  It needs a real economy to build banking on top of. Exactly. You start with jewelry, watches, then you get into banking. And Kuno Korten is actually a major player in the watch trade. Now, they are not watch makers, they are watch exporters. So they are facilitating the trade of all these best in the world Swiss watches out of Switzerland and into other countries around the world. And at this time, this is like the late 1890s, Kuno is doing about a million Swiss francs worth of business a year. Now, I don't know exactly what the Swiss franc to U.S. Dollar exchange rate was in 1900, but today the Swiss franc is stronger than the dollar. It's about one to one. They're pretty close. So call it a million dollars of business a year in the 1890s. ([Time 0:10:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/23092623-bcb2-425d-bd0c-e4e12a6010d8))
- Hans Wilsdorf, Rolex's founder, prioritized specialization from the start, focusing on unique horological products like travel watches. He believed this differentiation was key to success. He finds an amazing movement maker who specializes in smaller movements. They operate under a 99 year hand shake agreement until Rolex buys them. Hans wanted to do something different saw the products being produced were a commodity. They notice the boar war in south Africa is using wrist not pocket watches because it’s too hot to wear jackets to store the watch. He sees wrist watches are the future but he’s 10 years too early. WW1 catalyzes the need but in those years he’s mainly exporting to the outer empire. He realizes that one big thing is people don’t trust the quality of the movement so he gets them certified by the royal observatory. Building the right movement took 2 years. It gets tested here where all the royal navy time is tested. This place is associated with the people who invented gmt. After 45 days of testing it gets certified as an A. WW1 catalyzes the need for watches but anti German sentiment was high so they changed the name to Rolex from wilsdorf and davis the previous name of the partners. Rolex was a name Hans invented for his wrist watch brand much like Kodak as a name that was differentiated but meant nothing. This then takes over as the watch name.
  Transcript:
  Ben Gilbert
  Quote, I undertook the financial side and management of our concern. From the very outset, our success was assured by our fundamental policy to trade only in specialty horological products and especially in new lines. The first specialty we adopted was the traveling watch called a portfolio watch cased in the finest quality leathers. This line I immediately placed in large quantities on the market, the range covering every possible style and design. So, again, we're not at wristwatch yet, but he's like, the way that I'm going to succeed and break through here is through differentiation.
  David Rosenthal
  Yes, to do something different. It's like we always talk about. The most important thing to build a huge successful business is to do something different and unique that people have to come to you for and can't go to the commodity markets. Now, that doesn't necessarily mean you're right.
  Ben Gilbert
  Yeah, because he's not right with traveling watches.
  David Rosenthal
  We don't tell any of the stories here on Acquired of all the people who wanted to do something extremely unique and different and was not what the market wanted, but it's the classic, You have to be contrarian and right.
  Ben Gilbert
  Yeah, and I guess reading what Hans wrote there, maybe he was right. It sounds like the traveling watch was a success enough. He probably thought it was a success at the time. Yeah. So then, as legend has it, one day shortly after starting the company and focusing on these travel watches, Hans is reading an account of the Second Boer War ([Time 0:28:58](https://share.snipd.com/snip/31b5aad5-4538-4c56-9246-b6d1b1669622))
- Rolex moves to Geneva during the war because of brittish tariffs and a ban on imports of gold and silver. This was a watch making capital dating back to the 1500s. Geneva became a watchmaking hub due to Calvinism's ban on jewelry, leading goldsmiths to focus on functional watches. This, combined with harsh winters suitable for indoor work and the specialized 'etablissage' system which was a distributed manufacture system where each person focused on a small part then they all came together to create the whole, fostered watchmaking expertise. Also helped as a neutral country could export to both sides. Post ww1 wrist watches going time. Rolex is just another company here really not meaningfully differentiated. Kept good movements but wasn’t element proof. Hans reads the Swiss patents every day and they’re working on a way to block out water and dust. They can’t succeed but they find this patent that does and liscense it. Hans wasn’t a watch maker but a constructor. He was ruthless anyone could’ve seen his but he did because of his focus. This is what becomes the oyster and he markets this very well he’s building his brand vital in the early days. Sees the market opportunity and builds a brand.
  Transcript:
  David Rosenthal
  So all the way back in the 1500s, Geneva was a center of activity for the Protestant Christian world led by John Calvin. And if you know anything about Calvinism, it is very focused on moral uprightness. Yes, the Protestant work ethic. Yes. One of these tenets was banning frivolous things like ornamental jewelry. Local goldsmiths and jewelers instead focused on watchmaking, since watches served a real function in the world and were not frivolous. It was sort of this exception to the rule if you had that skill set.
  Ben Gilbert
  There's also human beings are human beings no matter what rules you impose on them. It's like, you know, life finds a way. Status always finds a way.
  David Rosenthal
  That's 100% right. So you've got the rise of Calvinism. Along with that religious reason that's sort of causing this local pivot of industries, you have one of climate, too. There are these long, harsh winters. And so an industry that could be done indoors in a small physical footprint was perfect. If you're going to go pick a profession out of a hat to have in Switzerland, mountainous country, long cold winter, like, this is a great one. And especially because it's so valuable at this point in time, you can become an important player in Europe, in the European economy, making something that you can make in your climate. Third, there's a cultural reason. So David, are you familiar with the term établissage? Ooh, no. Are you sure? It's supposed to be Swiss, not French. I was going to say.
  Ben Gilbert
  I've been to Geneva, and I've been to other places in Switzerland, but I know very little about its culture and history. Talk to me about terroir. I know exactly what you're talking about, but établissage, I don't know.
  David Rosenthal
  Okay. Well, it's Swiss for establishment, basically. But what etablissage means in this context is that it's this system, this sort of economic system that they established in the area of the Jura Mountains, where very small independent Companies, often one to 10 people, could focus on something small, like a single component. And then you'd have dozens of these small companies work together to create the finished product. It's almost like a distributed manufacturing system.
  Ben Gilbert
  Ah, so this is where Egler comes from. This is why he's got the workshop in the mountains. Etablissage. Yep, exactly.
  David Rosenthal
  And so with this specialization of labor in small companies, you could get really, really good at your tiny part, making, say, hairsprings that we'll talk about later, or these essential Elements of watch movements. These tiny companies by artisanal craftsmen, these very labor-intensive companies, got really, really, really good and pretty efficient at making their one thing. So that's kind of the backdrop of how the Swiss are producing things. And lastly, in the late 1500s, the French had been rising as a watchmaking powerhouse. And when the balance of power changed in France and the Catholics came to power, the French Huguenot refugees who had talents in jewelry and metalwork and watchmaking fled to Geneva. Yeah, these are the Protestants that got kicked out of France. Yeah, that's exactly right. And so the Protestant safe haven of Geneva, they brought their watchmaking expertise, or if they didn't have watchmaking expertise, that's all they could really do if they were jewelers Or metalworkers, since you can't make anything too shiny and too off-putting.
  Ben Gilbert
  Yeah. So this is how Switzerland gets the reputation as the watchmaking capital of the world.
  David Rosenthal
  Yeah, exactly. Basically, this creates centuries of momentum, especially in this distributed etablissage system of how Swiss watches were made. I kind of think about it as this beautiful blend of French beauty and appreciation for aesthetic and Swiss precision.
  Ben Gilbert
  Yeah. Well, I mean, it sounds like Switzerland itself. It's a blend of French beauty and German precision. I love it. Well, that's definitely one big reason why Hans is like, okay, we got to move Rolex to Geneva to participate in this tradition as we're now going to be selling to the world. But the other reason is after World War I, they're like, well, we're going to be selling to the world now. Britain is still going to be our largest market likely, but every country in the world is fighting, or at least every European country has troops fighting in World War I. They're all seeing the benefits of the wristwatch. This is going to be way, way, way bigger after World War I. I need to be able to serve the whole world.
  David Rosenthal
  So they want to be in a neutral country. Yeah. ([Time 0:49:57](https://share.snipd.com/snip/73c4202d-1524-4b2d-a981-0bfb12777296))
- In 1927, Rolex chose Mercedes Gleitz, a woman, as its first brand ambassador. She swam the English Channel in this showed its durability. This was a significant moment, as wristwatches were primarily seen as women's accessories at the time, although the men's market was growing. Interestingly Rolex watches are 50-50 men women and were first women’s products. Rolex created a watch that self wound and was element proof. This was the iPhone moment for watches.
  Transcript:
  Ben Gilbert
  This is a major, major, major moment, the Mercedes-Gleitz moment, the first brand ambassador of Rolex. It's interesting that the moment and the person that Hans chose for this launch was a woman. Super interesting. Back in 1927. Super interesting. Yes, the wristwatch was a ladies item before World War I, but after World War I, really, I would think the big market is the men's market. It's interesting. I dug into it. In this era, Rolex still was primarily a ladies' product. The men's market was growing. But if you look at their product catalogs, really up until World War II, ladies' models outnumbered men's models two to one. Whoa. These are the little like Prince watches. Yep. Yep. And definitely Hans's vision was like a wristwatch is for everybody, men and women. But it's interesting that they were really women's focused. And then we did a little more digging and asked some friends. And even to this day, I believe the market of buyers for Rolex watches is basically 50-50 men and women.
  David Rosenthal
  Which is insane. I never would have guessed that, especially because much of my research was lurking on the Rolex and watches subreddits, which are a very particular type of dude. And it comes across as a very male thing, at least the way that I'm exposed to watches. I mean, you read the amazing journalism about watches on Hodinkee and the whole world around appreciating watches. It's kind of male-focused. It's like a Porsche 911. Right. It's amazing that Rolex's history indexes so heavily to women and that even today, they move a lot of units to women, even though that's not where I come across Rolex in my day-to Well, It's certainly not where the enthusiast market is focused. But it's one of the really unique things about Rolex.
  Ben Gilbert
  So many of the other really, really high-end watch brands, with Cartier as an exception, I think really are men's brands. Oh, yes. Whereas Rolex, yeah, it really is 50-50. Amazing. All right, so that's Mercedes Gleitz. That's the oyster story, and that really is a huge watershed moment for Rolex and for the wristwatch industry.
  David Rosenthal
  And she's effectively the first testimony. I'm not sure they'd come up with that terminology yet, but this is something that they would lean heavily into as their means of marketing in the future. They would hate you calling it a brand ambassador. Yes, partner. It's Rolex partner is what they call it. No, I think it's testimony. I'm pretty sure it's this very particular word that they wanted to sort of invent and have to themselves. And it's different than influencer marketing. It's different than the way that someone appears in advertising a perfume for a five-year deal. I think it's this very long-term oriented, you are a part of the brand and you are a part of the brand kind of for your lifetime.

- **Mechanical Watch Mechanics**
  - Mechanical watches store energy in a mainspring, a tightly wound metal strip, and release it in precise intervals via an escapement.
  - The escapement's pallet fork ticks back and forth, driven by the balance wheel and hairspring, regulating energy release to the gear train.
  - This oscillation, based on materials' physical properties, powers the hands and complications with remarkable precision, like two seconds of daily deviation in chronometers.
  - Adding a self-winding mechanism to this intricate system, given the mainspring's resistance, presents a considerable mechanical challenge, unlike software solutions.
  Transcript:
  David Rosenthal
  Before going into the nuance of how Rolex's particular self-winding mechanism works, I think this is a good time to explain how mechanical watches work at all, what the key components Are, and frankly— It's like alchemy. —because one of the coolest things I've ever done to prepare for an acquired episode was go learn how a mechanical watch works. At a high level, you need two major components to make a timepiece. First, a way to store energy, and second, a way to release that energy in a predictable and precise interval.
  Ben Gilbert
  Which seems like, oh yeah, of course you could do that these days with, you know, a battery and electronics, but imagine doing that without a battery and without electronics. Exactly.
  David Rosenthal
  So yes, on that first one, storing energy, there is something called a mainspring. Did you read about this in the the research, David? Yep. A mainspring can store potential energy. So imagine a foot-long skinny piece of metal that you wind real tight and you stuff into something called a barrel. This looks like a film strip that's kind of stuffed inside a film canister that you'd see a stack of canisters in a projector room at a movie theater. That's sort of what you should imagine, a real tightly wound mainspring inside that barrel. Now, interestingly, to your point, David, this kind of begs the question, what is a battery? Right. Yes, I said a battery. Technically, that is a battery. Right. It's like a mechanical battery, since it's a way to store potential energy to be used later. Now, amazingly, the way a mechanical watch works these days is so energy efficient that the mainspring can store on the order of three days of potential energy to take the watch forward. It's amazing. Amazing. Okay, so moving on. Obviously, this isn't sufficient on its own. If you just release the mainspring in the barrel, it would spin around real fast, it would make all the gears spin, and you'd let all the energy out at once. Break the watch. Yes. So you need something to control the energy release from that mainspring and do it in slow, fixed time intervals. All mechanically. Yes. You need something to make the watch tick. Ayo. Yes. Watchmakers call this an escapement. Now, an escapement in a mechanical watch has two key components to harness that potential energy from the mainspring. One is a pallet fork. Come back to that. And two is something called the balance. So how does a pallet fork work? Well, a pallet fork looks like a little T with teeth on the edges of the top of the T. And it moves back and forth, a tick and a tock, like the pendulum of a grandfather clock. And as it flicks back and forth, it moves all the gears on the watch forward one tick or one beat. And there's this element that, uh, this may be several steps down the chain where it's actually usually like the hour movement, right?
  Ben Gilbert
  That then drives all the other movements off of that. Kind of depends on the watch and what complications are in it, things like that.
  David Rosenthal
  But yeah, the important thing to know is when one beat happens, when the pallet fork enables everything to move forward one beat, what it's really doing is allowing what's called the Escape wheel to turn one click. And that drives whatever else is in the gear train for that particular watch.
  Ben Gilbert
  Gotcha. Which some watches is, you know, just hours and minutes, some watches is hours and minutes and seconds, some watches is date, day, moon phase, what you had for breakfast, etc. Right.
  David Rosenthal
  And with these complications, which are the sort of features, it's really amazing because you can sort of think through what the algorithm would be to make such a complication. But when you're thinking through it, you're thinking sort of like a programmer. You're saying, well, if this, then that, you know, if the date is 31 days. Yeah, these are not computers. Right. All of the logic is encoded mechanically in a gear train. It's beautiful.
  Ben Gilbert
  Yeah.
  David Rosenthal
  So where we left off here is our escapement where we've got the pallet fork and it's this little T and it's a tick and a tock. It flicks back and forth and moves the gears all forward one tick. So how do you get it to tick back and forth? What is the mechanism by which this pallet fork goes tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock? This is where we introduce a big hero of the whole mechanical watch story, the balance. And the balance also has two parts. There's a balance wheel and a hairspring. And these two things are stuck together around the same center point. So picture the wheel of a bike, that would be the balance wheel, kind of like a hula hoop. And then the gears go around the same axle on a bike. You know, you can imagine that you've seen the rear wheel of a bike. In this analogy, those gears are the hairspring and the outer wheel is the balance wheel. So that's what this component kind of looks like. The hairspring looks really cool. It is another coiled up piece of metal, although it's much looser and more fluid than the tightly wound mainspring that we talked about earlier, unlike everything else that is incredibly Tight inside a watch, this component, the balance, almost floats and it moves with really low friction. It's weird because it's the opposite of everything else that's in the whole watch. And the way it works is the hair spring spins really fast one direction. And for anyone who's ever taken a spring and tried to uncoil it, you know, you kind of note that it only goes so far and then it wants to go back to its resting position. And then you try to go the other direction and tighten it a little bit. And that doesn't work either. And it wants to go back to its natural resting position. That's what's happening here. So you've got the hairspring, which spins really fast in one direction, and then the energy that it has stored is overcome by the mechanical resistance of unwinding the spring, so it Stops, and then it spins real fast in the other direction. And this cycle goes back and forth, spinning back and forth, tick and tock, and flicking that pallet fork back and forth to continually release one little interval of energy and one Little advance of the whole gear train. It is beautiful. Amazing.
  Ben Gilbert
  You can totally see why for the right kind of person, this is like a Porsche 911. It's just catnip.
  David Rosenthal
  You can't get enough of this. That's exactly right. And you end up with fancy names and proprietary things that Rolex makes in the far future called a Paracrom hairspring that has these amazing renders and animations and videos of how It works. It's gorgeous. Now, this happens really fast. This isn't like I just described it, where you go really far in one direction, then you run out of energy, and then you come back. This happens three, four, five, six times per second, depending on the watch. And that's if you hold a watch up to your ear and you hear these ([Time 1:18:32](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1c5c5999-230c-43ed-95ac-447ff5a1de22))
- Hans Wilsdorf, founder of Rolex, sought to improve automatic winding for watches but a broad patent held by John Harwood blocked this. The patent was broad but movement didn’t work. After Harwood's company went bankrupt, Wilsdorf developed the perpetual rotor, the industry standard automatic winding mechanism. This works through movement on the arm. Also at this time the inflation adjusted Rolex range was $450-$18k so it was an every man watch and high end vs now just luxury. Hans wanted a watch on every wrist in the world missionary. This is the final piece of the watch still used today. 3 pieces of tech are Accuracy water and element proof and self winding. Full system was finished. WW2 was really what made time valuable because of all the complex tech Rolex watches became valuable so much to coordinate. Legacy of ww2 is watch brands like sport watch come to prominence but also Europe is decimated so they look to the us to expand.
  Transcript:
  Ben Gilbert
  And the way that he went about it was he said, oh, yeah, like we were talking about, it's the winding crown that is the weakest link in the element proofness of a watch. What if I just start by eliminating the winding crown? Can I do that? And supposedly he gets inspired one day by watching children play on a seesaw. And that gives him the idea for his method of how he creates something called the hammer system of a hammer going up and down and hitting different ends inside the watch as the wrist moves Around. You can imagine that turning a crank, crank, crank, crank, crank. Yep. So he invents this system. And just like Swiss counterparts who invented what became the Oyster system under Rolex, he patents it. Now, what he decides to do is rather than making a watch out of this, he's going to create a company that's just an IP company, and he's going to license this self-winding IP to other watchmakers, Which he does. And a couple watchmakers out there take him up on it and incorporate it into their products. However, it doesn't prove too popular in the marketplace because a consequence of how he designed the system, the manual winding capability and the crown is eliminated entirely. So if your watch stops, if you don't wear it and you lose the charge in the mainspring, good luck getting it going again. You got to wear it for days or whatever to just get the energy back in there, and then you can set the time.
  David Rosenthal
  Oh, interesting.
  Ben Gilbert
  So that's a pretty big flaw in this watch. But because of how the patent was granted, at least in the UK, he and his company end up holding the rights to all self-winding watch technology. Wow, that is broad. In Britain, yeah, no matter what the method is, or at least that's my understanding. Brutal. So Hans, of course, in Rolex, sees this. He knows he needs an automatic system for the Oyster to really unlock the potential of the product and fully break the wristwatch product for the marketplace here. But his hands are tied. He can't do anything, at least in Britain, as long as Harwood has this patent. And Hans knows that ultimately the method that Harwood uses is not good. He's not going to license from Harwood because he knows it's an inferior implementation. And then fortunately, fate strikes and the market does its thing. And in 1929, Harwood's company goes bankrupt, probably aided along by the stock market crash of 1929 and the entering into the Great Depression, et cetera. So finally, the door is now open for Hans and Rolex to complete the product here.
  David Rosenthal
  Yep. And while we're here in 1929, just a quick reference point for folks, there was an article published at this time that said you could get a Rolex for as little as $25. Even if you inflation adjust that, it's like $450 today, or for as high as $1,000, which is $18,000. Rolex's top of their line today is a lot more than $18,000, and the bottom of their line is a lot more than $450. But that gives you a sense of the type of wealth you would need in order to purchase a Rolex at this point in history. It was a meaningful purchase, but not a purchase reserved for only the elite class.
  Ben Gilbert
  Definitely not. Rolex at this point is not a luxury brand. Correct. It's going to transform into one over the ensuing decades. But no, now, you know, Hans was really, really focused and his genius and contribution to the field was on creating the product of the wristwatch. And he wanted the wristwatch to be on every wrist in the world. Yep. Which he achieved. So here we are in the early 30s. After a couple years of work, Rolex finally cracks it and patents their own rotor, quote unquote, self-winding system, which still to this day is the primary method of self-winding Across the entire industry. This is a perpetual rotor at the back of the watch case that spins around in both directions and captures kinetic energy as the wearer moves their wrist around. And importantly, unlike the hammer movement, it spins 360 freely in either direction, so it's not hitting anything. ([Time 1:28:59](https://share.snipd.com/snip/928c3431-acad-4af9-8b2c-d73752bf0401))
- **Rolex's Strategic Placement.** Rolex gifted watches to influential figures like Winston Churchill and Dwight D. Eisenhower. This association with world leaders established their brand positioning as the watch of those who "command the world." This is when they really ramped up marketing. Then started using athletes to expand the appeal. Rolex realizes the tech is now commoditized and they need to build a brand start to work with talent agency. They call these watches professional give them to race car driver ect. Eventually Rolex through Paul Newman pivots to becoming a luxury watch.
  Transcript:
  Ben Gilbert
  Well, remember, this is a three-putt. This is just the first putt here. So Guisson gladly accepts this great watch. Well, Rolex is really ramping production here now. So it turns out, you know, a few months later, they make their hundred thousandth chronometer that they have certified.
  David Rosenthal
  Oh, this one goes to Winston Churchill.
  Ben Gilbert
  This one, Hans, goes to General Guisson, you know, newly christened Rolex convert and says, would you please on our behalf offer this to your dear friend, Sir Winston Churchill? Winston Churchill accepts. Now Winston Churchill is a Rolex man. Well, at less than a year later, Rolex makes their 150,000 officially certified chronometer once again in the now, you know, new top of the line Datejust model. And who does Hans go to for this one? Through, not directly, but with some influence of the fact that his friend Sir Winston Churchill wore it. He goes to General Dwight D. Eisenhower. American hero, leader of the Allied forces, architect of the Allied victory in this new world order. And Eisenhower, because his good friend Churchill wears Rolex, says, how could I not accept? And so now Dwight Eisenhower becomes a Rolex man. And then a few short years later in 1952, Eisenhower becomes president of the United States of America with his iconic gold Rolex Datejust on his wrist at almost all times.
  David Rosenthal
  Yes. And this is the very first time that Rolex kind of gets the idea of what all of their future marketing and positioning will be, which is those who command the world wear Rolex.
  Ben Gilbert
  So at this time, Rolex finally brings on a third-party advertising agency, the J. Walter Thompson Advertising Agency in New York. Rolex and J. Walter Thompson, in collaboration after Eisenhower becomes president, wearing his date just, launched a campaign in the U.S. Almost literally what you said, Ben. The tagline of the campaign is, men who guide the destinies of the world wear Rolex watches.
  David Rosenthal
  They printed this. Yes. That is on the advertisement. All over magazines across America.
  Ben Gilbert
  And maybe the world, too. I don't know. It's incredible.
  David Rosenthal
  Men who guide the destinies of the world wear Rolex watches. Shameless.
  Ben Gilbert
  Shameless. So many things to say. Like, obviously, today, that would be, you know, people, not men. But it's also literally true.
  David Rosenthal
  You know, you got Eisenhower, you got Churchill, you got Castro. Totally. Wearing Rolexes. I'm going to save for later in the 60s and 70s some of their advertising campaigns, but there are a few sentences that we just have to say do show up that is along these lines. There's one that is, when a man has the world in his hands, you expect to find a Rolex on his wrist. Oh, this is Don Draper. This is better than Don Draper. A Rolex will never change the world. We leave that to the people who wear them. Oh, I mean.
  Ben Gilbert
  We could just end the episode here.
  David Rosenthal
  Now that is brand positioning.
  Ben Gilbert
  That is true brand positioning. And the fact that they engineered getting one on the wrist of the president of the United States is so genius.

  And interestingly, even though they started with Mercedes Gleitz, this idea of like human achievement and accomplishment and the top of their field, they aren't doing that in this Era. It is about the people who command the world. And they later on come back to achievement and the people who are scientists. And again, I'll save it for the 60s and 70s, but this is a very clear positioning of those who command the world.
  Ben Gilbert
  Yep. Yep. Now, the problem, I guess, with those who command the world as just absolutely gangster as it is, is ultimately you're talking about a small market. Now, it's great aspirational, you know, it helps the brand Halo and whatnot, but more people, especially as we enter the 50s and 60s, want to be Arnold Palmer, shall we say, than want To be Dwight Eisenhower.
  David Rosenthal
  Yeah. ([Time 1:49:13](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5c0f1c54-04b3-49d4-a33a-fc7d7f89a711))
- The Quartz Crisis (1970s-80s) saw quartz watches, cheaper and more accurate, disrupt the Swiss mechanical watch industry. From 1975-1981 quartz watches went from 3% to a majority share causing Swiss watch industry collapse and mass consolidation. This was in tandem with the Paul Newman stuff so watches had to now be about luxury not performance. This is the luxury strategy being executed. Other watches didn’t take the classic strategy raising prices and cutting supply. Rolex during the financial crisis doubles down on advertising and doesn’t cut prices like everyone else. Their long term thinking cemented their position they saw the wave was coming they needed to ride. Then when the market recovers they don’t over correct so it shows 2 way stability. Great for brand.

  So by the time you get to the early 70s, you've now got integrated circuits. That's exactly right. The first quartz watch that hit the market in 1969 from Seiko was dependent on the invention and miniaturization of the transistor and integrated circuit before it could actually Happen. So that's why we're sort of stuck waiting from the 20s all the way to 69 before it can be used in a watch. So really, the whole thing is Bell Labs. Exactly right. And everything we've talked about so far is a manufacturing story. It's a craft story. It's an apprenticeship story. This is a technology story. So amazingly, as you pointed out, the Swiss did see this coming. Just like how Kodak famously invented digital photography in their lab, the Swiss saw what happened with the tooting fork, and they wanted to be ready. So in 67, two years before the Japanese debut of the Seiko Astron, there was a quartz chronometer in a lab at CEH, which is Switzerland's electronics watch laboratory, that was twice As accurate as a mechanical watch. They just didn't actually have an impetus to be first to market. Right, right. Why would we? This is really dangerous for our industry. We've made it. Yeah, let's keep this in the lab. Yeah. Over to Japan, the Seiko Astron is launched in 1969. You would not have guessed it was going to disrupt the whole industry. It cost as much as a new car, and it wasn't more accurate. It could be off by up to five seconds a day. So what's the big deal?
  Ben Gilbert
  But just like semiconductors, they get on the learning curve.
  David Rosenthal
  Exactly. That's exactly right. It's a technology story. It's based on semiconductors. So the price value curve that it would follow actually looked a lot more like the early PC from the Microsoft episode we did. The fact that it's in watches because that's the consumer need that's being filled actually isn't relevant for predicting how much better it's going to get. You should be looking at the technology. So the quartz watch starts at this Toyota Corolla price point, comes down in price a thousand X. It used way fewer parts and required very little know-how to assemble it. You could invest upfront in machinery and have very, very, very low variable costs and labor costs. So for the first time in watchmaking, you had economies of scale and operating leverage. It was a technology product in an artisan market.
  Ben Gilbert
  Yeah.
  David Rosenthal
  So this whole thing, once it gets going, happens so fast.
  Ben Gilbert
  And in the early days, the Swiss industry and a lot of makers, including Rolex, released their own quartz models too.
  David Rosenthal
  Yeah. Hold on to that for a second. So here's how the quartz revolution went. And the Japanese sort of think of it as the quartz revolution. The Swiss think of it as the quartz crisis. By the end of the 1970s, you could get a quartz watch for cheaper than a mechanical watch. It was more accurate. So here in 1979, mechanical watches are, for the vast majority of scenarios, functionally obsolete. Unless you are an astronaut or a pilot or an adventurer who prefers a spring over a battery that could die, there is no practical reason to ever buy a mechanical watch again.
  Ben Gilbert
  And it's like the Olympics are being timed with quartz timepieces. Right. And interestingly, omega quartz at the Olympics.
  David Rosenthal
  Interesting. But obviously, this is not the end of our story, and mechanical watches would go on to be a better business than ever 50 years later. Very different, but much greater in revenue than ever before. So there's this kind of wild thing that our beautiful mechanical watch hero protagonist here is now obsolete, functionally. So there were a few iterations of how this went. The American firms tried to make quartz watches with LED technology. The Hamilton Pulsar came out in 72. These were really cool when you look at them, but in the long run, they were a complete failure. You had to push a button to turn the LED on, so it actually took both hands to read the time, one to wear the watch, one to push the button. Some companies followed into the market starting in 74, and it will be very familiar to acquired listeners. National Semiconductor, Fairchild Semiconductor, Texas Instruments. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, there we go. Yep. Then came the Stampede, Commodore, Intel, HP, Hughes Aircraft, dozens of companies flooded in. Wow.
  Ben Gilbert
  Hughes Aircraft getting into the market. Wow.
  David Rosenthal
  Yes. And, you know, these companies made integrated circuits. And so they thought, well, we can make consumer products around them, too, because we make the internals. But A, they weren't great at building brands. These were all B2B companies. And B, they were horribly commoditized. This market immediately became commodity, had no barrier to entry, and all the profits immediately got arbitraged out. So LED, failure. The next step is twofold. One, quartz movements powering analog watch faces. And this started with the Seiko Astron. This was the thing that the Japanese did first in 1969. And the other branch, which every listener will know well, is digital LCD watches with liquid crystal displays that ended up being vastly superior to LEDs since they were always on. And these also worked on a quartz movement. Seiko, Citizen, and later Casio were extremely successful for a time making these out of Japan. So Hong Kong becomes the powerhouse for inexpensive manufacturing of all of this, along with Taiwan, South Korea, and mainland China. And so by 1980, just a few years in, I mean, think about this, 69, the Seiko Astron launches. 75 is when the Swiss are going, oh, crap. And then within four years, it's over. Quartz completely ran the table. So by 1980, Hong Kong was already exporting 126 million watches a year, half of which were digital. Wow. Switzerland at peak made $90 million. And then, boom, a few years in, Hong Kong has $126 million. By 1981, the next year, Japanese watch exports surpass Switzerland. Seiko actually was great at brand building, advertising, messaging in a way that the American B2B semiconductor firms were horrible at. And then, 1985, just four years after Japan meets Switzerland, Japan's exports are 3x. Wow. Wow.
  Ben Gilbert
  And the absolutely incredible thing is, now that you all know this, this is the backdrop that the Paul Newman craze happens. Right? Yeah.
  David Rosenthal
  So the Swiss market's global share would fall from that 85 at peak in 1945 to just 15% by 1980. Wow. The number of firms fell from 2,000 companies in 1960 to fewer than 500 in 1980. Just absolutely destroyed. Quartz output accounted for only 3% of units in 1975. By 1979, 31% of new watches were quartz powered. Wow. From 75 ([Time 2:53:30](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e0941d3f-cf16-46e4-a751-6a67dc70f0a7))
