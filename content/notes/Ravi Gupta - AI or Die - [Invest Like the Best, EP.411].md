### Highlights

- **AI-Driven Disruption and Adaptation**
  - Traditional metrics like headcount and quarterly earnings adherence may become liabilities in the rapidly changing AI landscape.
  - Companies must prioritize agility and adaptability to remain competitive.
  - Individuals and organizations need to cultivate ambition, curiosity, resilience, adaptability, and high agency.
  - AI tools offer powerful capabilities for research, analysis, and idea generation, enabling more effective decision-making.

  And so I think the most intense version of that is envisioning a group of developers hanging out on a Friday night and sorting companies based on their market cap and their number of people And their NPS in some calculation. And finding the biggest company with the most people with the lowest NPS and then competing about who can build it faster. It's just like a crazy thought of what could happen. But I don't think it's crazy if the AIs turn out to be as powerful as we think. And then the much less intense version that I think is very real is anything you have that prevents you from embracing change right now is a huge limiter. It's a huge limiter. If it's a lot of people in your organization, if it's adherence to a quarterly earnings that you've committed to, if it is unwillingness to make a change. If this is changing as fast as I think it is, and I think the people that run these companies say it is, anything that reduces your agility is a massive problem.
  Patrick O'Shaughnessy
  So since you first had these couple aha moments with your friends at those leading edge companies, what have you personally done differently to try to respect this faster than you thought Pace of change? I love the word choice to respect it.
  Ravi Gupta
  So the first thing, I guess, to be very honest, was I talked to Avni about what are we doing to educate our kids? If this is true, my first thought was not, what does it mean for businesses? It means, what does it mean for our family? What does it mean for the kids? What is the right way to teach them in a world where the tools that are going to be available to them are going to be totally different? We realized that I don't think that there's actually skills that I can teach them. There's behaviors, there's feelings, there's approaches. And so what we got to was some version of, we got to make sure that they're ambitious. We got to make sure they're curious. We got to make sure they're resilient, adaptable, and they're high agency. I think the reason that that then dovetailed with like, what have changed now? I was sort of like, that's the same thing you have to be if you're like at a company. You actually need the exact same things. And you and I have talked about this separately. And I think you've added a couple to that, which we should go through. Those same behaviors are going to have to exist in the company. Specifically, what have I done personally is I try to use it more for real work. I had dinner with somebody recently, and I hope he's not listening because of the setup I'm going to give you. But it was with a company, somebody who was on the board of a company that I didn't know that much about. I was not well prepared for the dinner. And it was somebody who I wanted to make sure I had a productive conversation with. And there was 20 minutes before I was going to go to the dinner and I prompted the model, the latest model, the $200 a month one, which I know sometimes people just don't want to do that because $200 a month is a lot of money. It is, but it's not a lot of money when you think about relative to seeing the future. I mean, that's literally what they're offering you right now. So I put in, I said, I am a sophisticated investor. That was a very generous term for myself. I have a dinner in 20 minutes. I am not prepared for this dinner. And I'd like to understand deeply what this company does in a way that I can understand within 10 or 15 minutes. I'd like to understand these four or five things. And I'd like to have some good ideas for this person for what they could do. And are my instructions clear? And I use deep research. And he said, no, can you tell me these four or five things? I told it. Four minutes of thinking, and it came back. And I read it on the way to the dinner. And we had a great dinner. This person thought that I knew what I was talking about. That is a pretty different use than, can you summarize this email for me? I think that the AI interaction most of us have is Apple's an amazing company, but the Apple intelligence summary of your text message is the most absurd. It's a terrible experience, right? And it's truly like laughable. It's more used for comedy than it is used for like actual value ([Time 0:08:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/267d0132-f314-437f-8749-13f987b7b693))
- **Reacting vs Predicting**
  * Being a world-class reactor is more valuable than being a world-class predictor in today's rapidly changing environment. 
  * Focus on responding quickly to new information and embracing change.
  * With ai we can just react and see where these tools could go then go there.

  I also really like your idea of the difference between a world-class predictor and a world-class reactor. Can you talk about that new dichotomy?
  Ravi Gupta
  It's such a perfect question for me because it gets to merge together things that I love that may not seem like they have anything to do with each other. But the first person I heard say that was Coach K at Duke. He said, I am not a world-class predictor, but I am a world-class reactor. And he was referring to it as like when college basketball changed from people that stay for four years to people that play for one and then go to the NBA. He was like, I couldn't have predicted that that's the way the rules would go. I didn't know. But you know what? Once that was the game on the field, I played it extremely well. That actually was very helpful for me, Patrick, along with Kohler's quote, because it's very intimidating to think about predicting the future. There are really smart people in Silicon Valley. There are really smart people all over the world. I don't know how to predict the future. I do not have the IQ points for that. There are people that are much brighter than me who can do that. I think the thing that I do have in my control is the ability to respond quickly to new information. I can control that. I can control being open-minded to seeing new information and then reacting quickly. I can control being averse to change. That is something that it feels empowering to me. And it's something that's in my hands and it's in the team's hands too. I can help the team be like, guys, let's embrace this change. Let's embrace this reality and let's go react to it. I think right now the world is totally awesome for people that can be world-class reactors rather than world-class predictors. If you look at the people that created these labs, they were world-class predictors. That was an amazing insight however many years ago. Look at what the scaling laws are going to do. Look at these exponentials. And they themselves, funny enough, are sort of humble about it. They're like, it wasn't that hard. If you just believe that the scaling laws continue, you could bet that this was going to happen. But like, it was hard. Looking at what a model can do today and being like, that's going to be cheaper in the future. That's not being a world-class predictor. That's just looking at the facts. What is hard is choosing optimism to go and react to that, but it's totally within our control. It's hard the way going to the gym is hard. It's not hard the way creating a new mathematical theorem is hard. It takes discipline and it takes fortitude and it takes a choice. But I love those kinds of things because those are in our control and they don't require like a new brain. They require more discipline. That's something all of us can do.

- **Investing in Slope, Not Intercept**
  - The best companies can achieve significantly steeper growth trajectories ("slope") than others.
  - This emphasizes the importance of early investment and identifying companies with high growth potential.
  - Key attributes of successful founders in this environment include ambition, curiosity, resilience, adaptability, and imagination.
  - Agility and adaptability are crucial for navigating rapid changes, prioritizing customer value above all else.
  - The gap between the best and mediocre companies will widen, making early identification even more critical.

  One of my favorite concepts that I've heard, I don't know who the first person was to say this. The first person I heard it from was Pat Grady, my partner, which was we invest in slope, not intercept. I guess if I really take that as the logic, I think that's still very true. I think the thing that is possible is that for the best companies, the slope can be way different and the slope can be way steeper. And I think if you take that to its extreme, that means that for the best things, sure, like you should be willing to pay more. What I think it really puts a premium on though is be earlier into those companies, figure out what those things are going to be. And I think that what that then comes back to is like, okay, what are the attributes of the people who are building them? And I think that comes back to some of the stuff that you've talked about and we've talked about, but like I mentioned ambition, I mentioned curiosity, I mentioned resilience, I mentioned Adaptability. You mentioned imagination in there. I think that's a hugely important word for thinking about this. So figuring out people that are close to what this can do, optimistic about what it can do, have some imagination, and then are also adaptable as hell, because it keeps changing. When it changes, the only thing that you keep dear is like the obligation to deliver magic to the customer and everything else can change. Probably the bigger thing I would add to my list, Patrick, is in the past, I think resilience, grit, those are things that have always been there for any founder that you like really want. I think the thing that I do believe is newly important, it's always been important, but more important for me is the agility adaptability. It's the world-class reactor point. It is the willingness to change on a dime with new information and the desire to go and figure out that new information and to never hold a convenient belief and to examine it. That's probably new. And that combined with more slope for the best ones. I think that what's going to happen, the best companies are going to be worth more and the mediocre ones are going to be worth less. I just think the gap is going to widen and that is exciting and intimidating because you better get it right.
  Patrick O'Shaughnessy
  You get to sit literally at ground zero of the community of people that are investing in these companies. Could be well argued that any company raising is going to Sequoia first or amongst a handful of firms that they're going to first and would love to take their capital if they could. You get this complete tip of the spear view into this world. If the class of investor in Silicon Valley draw radius around your office is wise to this.
