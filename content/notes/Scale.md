### Highlights

- No politics no committees no bureaucracy just commitment and smart people working together and sharing ideas no divide between the ones in charge and those below
    - **Tags:** #ownership-(take/create), #agency, #commitment, #a-players, #shared-idea, #decentralization
    - **Note:** Team effort no BS no committees everyone working together as a unit a players working as a team having agency and autonomy
- Companies die because they scale sub linearly and need revenue to balance expenses. Companies are more focused on efficiency than innovation while cities can raise taxes and through interactions create more innovation
    - **Tags:** #system-destruction, #scale, #innovation-over-efficiency, #creation-of-new-knowledge
    - **Note:** Companies die because they stop creating new knowledge.
- Companies scale linearly have half lives of roughly 10.5 years either through mergers or acquisitions or bankruptcy. A company’s survival rate is its growth ie revenue and maintenance cost ie expense. After getting to a certain size companies grow with gdp. Companies scale linearly
    - **Tags:** #capital-allocation, #linear-growth, #first-dont-lose-then-win, #scale, #companies
    - **Note:** Companies scale linearly and die when their expenses outstrip their growth. If you don’t run out of money you can never die.
- Businesses follow a power law distribution. Walmart is a smaller store at a larger scale
    - **Tags:** #power-law, #scale
- Social networks lead to Greater idea creation and likewise greater crime and consumption in the 15% scaling ratio mentioned earlier. Cities benefit from enhanced social activities and economies of scale. More people more ideas and more efficiency to keep them moved around fed housed ect
    - **Tags:** #coordination, #scale, #emergent-behavior
    - **Note:** Cities increase the amount of interactions people have which is both a good thing for ideas and bad thing for crime.
- To get a better sense of net risk use a power law distribution and multiply probability by magnitude
    - **Tags:** #tail-risk, #risk-and-return, #emergent-behavior, #power-law
    - **Note:** In net risk we must quantify the tails which are high impact low probability and by their nature tough to quantify
- Conclusion that cities are set up like human brains and relationships. Dunbar has humans broken into groups. Intimate circle 5 close friends 15 closer 50 who you are friends with at 150 who you know this is dynamic
    - **Tags:** #complex-adaptive-systems, #relationship, #coordination, #dunbars-number, #scale, #sum-of-your-5-closest-friends
- Birth Growth and death are driven by mass and temperature and to scale both actually and through the exponents as well the average atp or energy and organism uses
    - **Tags:** #scale, #exponential-vs-linear-thinking-(humans-strugle-with-exponential)
- Mammals cannot scale smaller than current existing despite fractals because of current heart rates and circulation systems pumping blood in different ways both ac and dc
    - **Tags:** #scale, #fractals, #evolution
- Fracticals are things that are the same scaled up as scaled down ie broccoli our body uses this to gain the 1/4th power scaling laws by using the body’s 3 dimensions + fractals as the 4th to gain the 1/4th advantage. Distance is a fractal the more course you measure boarders the more nuanced and longer the boarder gets and small indents and scales are inline with large ones at scale ie the indent on a river bank can be at scale the Grand Canyon they’re broccoli
    - **Tags:** #favorite, #fractals, #complex-adaptive-systems, #bottoms-up-and-top-down, #scale
    - **Note:** Fractals and how they exist in the world. This effects scale and fractals create both high level order and low level nuance.much of the world is fractal. It unlocks another scaling dimension
- Networks are spacefilling have invariant terminal units and minimize the energy needed to pump fluid through the system
- In biology it’s more about finding the question and the answers will come on physics it’s more about knowing the questions and digging for the answer. Shows the importance for cross disciplinary learning and models + knowing limits of models ie Newtonian physics at small or large scales breaks down but prettt good otherwise. Alometric scaling is non linear scaling. Different things matter at different scales at a large scale the earth is blue but more granular and the earth is people and mountains and animals not one generalization scale matters. Course gain or 0 order is the highest level most basic generalization or assumption
    - **Tags:** #definitions, #favorite, #ask-the-right-question, #levels-of-emergence, #cross-disciplinary, #knowledge-gain, #biology, #physics, #domain-dependence, #meta-commentary, #perspective-taking
    - **Note:** Levels of emergence and knowing the path to proceed. Know what matters at what level of emergence and field (which are kinda levels as well).
      In some fields the high level questions are clear but the methods need to be discovered and all fields fall on this spectrum with both inputs. This is meta commentary on levels of emergence and domain dependence
      Understand level of emergence and know the lmits of your models/ field cross disciplinary thinking
- Kleiber's law, named after Max Kleiber for his biology work in the early 1930s, is the observation that, for the vast majority of animals, an animal's metabolic rate scales to the ¾ power of the animal's mass. Symbolically: if q0 is the animal's metabolic rate, and M the animal's mass, then Kleiber's law states that q0 ~ M¾. Thus, over the same timespan, a cat having a mass 100 times that of a mouse will consume only about 32 times the energy the mouse uses.
    - **Tags:** #scale, #economies-of-scale, #kleiber's-law
    - **Note:** This law is the definition of economies of scale. As the animal gets bigger the consumption increases sub linearly.
- Building models in line with scale. You need to understand scale before you do something to understand how you should change the creation proportionally to how it acts in the real world.
    - **Tags:** #scale, #models-(understand-limits), #bias-(inherent-in-models)
    - **Note:** Scale is vital in realistic models.
- Cities also follow power law distributions for both infrastructure and ideas
    - **Tags:** #power-law, #scale
- Networks are driven by scaling properties the most powerful and popular is a power law distribution which changes exponentially with scale

- A complex system is something that creates something greater than the sum of its parts and moreover it’s behavior can’t be predicted from the smaller aspects. Composed of agents that once aggregated take on collective charistics create effects that couldn’t be manifested or predicted from the individual agent. Whole greater than the sum of its part simple rules create complex outcomes ie ant colony. Collective non linear outcome of a complex System is its emergent behavior. Emergent behavior and self organization is the adaptability of complex systems to new challenges and environments ie complex adaptive system basically evolution. While more cells translates a system from simple to complex the underlying nature and building blocks of the system will be the same. Things change with scaling

    - **Note:** Complex systems lead to different behaviors at higher levels of emergence that derive from simple rules that create a ton of reach.
      Complex system produces something greater than the sum of its parts that can't be predicted at lower levels of emergence. Systems have emergent behavior and self organization and adapt to the changing environment.
- To understand how systems scale we need to understand that scaling is often non linear. The bigger the animal the less calories it needs in proportion the larger the city the more we would expect the gdp per capita to be higher and not scale perfectly. Economies of scale the larger you are the less you need vs increasing returns to scale. Get more with less vs when you increase you need proportionally less
    - **Tags:** #complex-adaptive-systems, #non-linear-effects, #scale, #leverage-points, #economies-of-scale
    - **Note:** Understanding where scale works best to give you the most leverage. Non linear/ economies of scale. We must understand the system to understand how it scales.
- Energy underlies every decision. To increase societal complexity or even live everything needs energy. Whenever energy is utilized some energy is lost as useless energy as a byproduct that creates chaos and trends the works toward more uncertainty. Exchange energy for resources is entropy and it creates disorder. 2nd degree of thermodynamics

    - **Note:** Energy use is what drives the world forward. The entire human history is more efficient uses and transference of energy. We take ordered nuclear energy and make it more chaotic in our use. Nuclear energy is lower in the stack of chaos. When we impose order we also create chaos.
- General and scaling laws of the book that underlie many relationships is the goal of the book
