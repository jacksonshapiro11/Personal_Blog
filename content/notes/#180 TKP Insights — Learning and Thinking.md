### Highlights

- Episode AI notes
  1. The physical environment, including factors like room color, can influence clear thinking.
  2. Intuition and preconceived answers can hinder clear thinking.
  3. Emotions can also pose obstacles to clear thinking. ([TimeÂ 0:00:00](https://share.snipd.com/episode-takeaways/cad9517b-f784-495c-a77e-ad21395c5668))
- The Influence of Physical Environment on Clear Thinking
  Key takeaways:
  - Some colors are more calming than others in a room.
  - Intuitive views can hinder clearer thinking.
  - Ready-made answers can impede clearer thinking.
  - Emotions can obstruct clearer thinking.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 3
  Are there things that we can do to, I guess, push the environment to be more conducive to clearer thinking, the physical environment in this case?
  Speaker 4
  Oh, there are all sorts of odd findings, you know, the color of the room, some colors are better than others and you would expect that some colors are more calming than others. So you wouldn't want to be in a red room.
  Speaker 3
  Making decisions.
  Speaker 2
  Making decisions.
  Speaker 4
  But you know, those are extreme and minor effects.
  Speaker 3
  I want to come to intuition and noise later. Is there anything else that stands out that gets in the way of clearer thinking that we can sort of bring to the surface now?
  Speaker 4
  You know, what gets in the way of clearer thinking is that we have intuitive views of almost everything. So as soon as you present a problem to me, I've, you know, I've already made answer. And what gets in the way of clearer thinking is those ready made answers and we can't help but help them. So that's one thing that gets in the way. Emotions get in the way.

    - **Note:** Our emotions and biases get in the way of clear thinking our ready made answers. When we see things in our worldview we are more likely to accept it. We accept fake news from ourside easier. Some environments are more conducive to learning and use algorithms to mitigate biases. Trust your systems. Donâ€™t fork intuition too quickly delay it a bit. Engage system 2. Pomodoro technique you turn off all distractions and work hard for 25 minutes then you reward yourself after. Balance focus and diffused mode. Exercise is very important in learning and brain health. Embrace Boardem and let your brain rest. Science moves from dogma to dogma. Investigate your subconscious and look harder where your model of the world and reality donâ€™t match thatâ€™s where you find secrets where everyone rejects something but itâ€™s still true. You need to get down to first principles and fundamentals when learning. Donâ€™t play pick up basketball but master dribbling. Key to learning a skill break into sub skills and rehearse and practice those. Rehearse suboptimal conditions. Create internal locus of control. If you dismiss what offends you you will never learn seems out disconfirming opinions. You can always devalue and dismiss but donâ€™t.
