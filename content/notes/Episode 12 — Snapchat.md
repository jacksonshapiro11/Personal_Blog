  Speaker 2
  December of 2012, they add the next big pillar of Snapchat, which is video. And then also in December of 2012, Mark Zuckerberg has heard about this app and he sends an email to Evan Spiegel.
  Speaker 1
  He has. And it does seem that he had heard of it a little bit earlier since kind of quietly, I don't understand Microsoft, Facebook had been working on an app called Polk. They were reviving the old name of the feature that we all know from early on in Facebook use that really never gets used today to basically create a clone. And actually from a UX perspective, a very excellent clone of Snapchat. And when Zuck does meet with Evan, it's kind of an interesting story of how he gets there. Zuck says, hey, why don't you come hang out at Facebook? Evan says, oh, next time I open the barrier, Evan, I think follows up and says something like, why don't you come down here? So Zuck actually flies down to meet Evan at Snapchat's headquarters. I think there's a whole story about them getting like a private, they're renting a private apartment to have this thing. But Zuck walks in with a plan and he basically says, hey, here's how I would do Snapchat and sort of how I see your role in the world and how I could see this all playing out. And it's his grandiose vision and it's quite impressive. And he ends with saying, and we're going to be launching Polk next week. Duh, duh, duh. It's not an offer to buy them. It's not like it's like we are going to.
  Speaker 2
  This is not the acquisition offer. This is not the acquisition offer you've been looking for. It is not.
  Speaker 1
  And so Zuck flies home. You know, Evan, I think as the story goes, I feel like this might be overdramatized, but the book is The Art of War. Yeah. Evan gets his whole team a copy of The Art of War and they all are. Sun sues The Art of War. Yes. Evan Spigles carve out for the week. Yeah. Yeah. That was the guess we were going to have on. And they watch carefully as Polk launches. Evan had deleted his Facebook account, so he goes to Bobby and has him check out Polk and sure enough, it's great. But the thing that's even greater is all the buzz that happens for Snapchat by Polk launching.
  Speaker 2
  Yeah. And I believe Evan then is quoted as saying like this is basically like Merry Christmas to Snapchat when Facebook did this because it brought so much attention to the platform. Like the second word out of everybody's mouth when talking about this huge launch that Facebook was publicizing was Snapchat. Yeah.
  Speaker 1
  And a couple interesting observations here. One, that's a super common thing. I think that a lot of the times I know this actually at first hand, I made it to do list managers similar to reminders for the iPhone before reminders launched and what reminders launched, we were like, oh my God, we're dead. Apple Sherlock dust and Sherlocking is a reference to Apple back in the day launching an app built into the platform called Sherlock that put all the other search apps out of business. I think I had that story, right? It might have been called, oh yeah, the app was called Sherlock and then Apple built spotlight. Anyway, something like that. But what it did for us as a to-do list was make a lot of people realize they needed a to-do list manager and maybe they didn't like the generic one that Apple launched. Same thing with InstaPaper when Apple launched the what is it, a related service that's built into GoS. Yeah, but nobody uses. And sales for InstaPaper spiked. So this is kind of an interesting, like, don't be so afraid of the big guy launching your feature. ([Time 0:20:26](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e5a96874-1aba-4c13-b056-cc6adc4c8060))
    - **Note:** Don’t be Afraid of the big guy launching your feature because it’s your bread and butter and it’s an ancillary product for them it can actually drive growth and give legitimacy.
