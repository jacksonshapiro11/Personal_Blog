  When I was six years old, I started playing the violin. And within a few years, I think my parents realized that my dreams ambitions were surpassing whatever connections they had in the classical music world. My dad's a physicist. My mom helps students get green cards. This was really not in their domain. And so one day I remember my mom and I were in New York for a different violin audition. And she knew that the Juilliard School of Music in New York was what I had my sight set on, even though by the way, she had absolutely no chance of getting it at all at that time. That was my dream. And so we're in New York and my mom just looked at me and said, hey, why don't we just stop by Juilliard and you can see what it looks like and it'll just be a fun experience. We walk over to Juilliard and then as we're passing by the front door, my mom looked at me kind of seriously and said, why don't we just go in? And I remember thinking that she was totally nuts. I mean, what did that even mean? We did not have an invite. Right. I was not a student there. But she said, let's just go in there. What's the worst thing that can happen? And so we walked in there and my mom, you know, let the security guards know that her daughter dreamed of coming here and could we just check it out? And we ended up running into a fellow student and her mom and my mom was chatting with them and expressing that I was really interested in playing the violin. And within just a few minutes, my mom had asked them if they were willing to introduce me to their violin teacher. Then fast forward, they were really gracious and said yes. And then 20 minutes after that, I was auditioning on the spot for this Juilliard teacher. Just looking back, I mean, yeah, it was a pretty wild story of just waltzing in there, but it was such a formative lesson for me about the importance of trying to be entrepreneurial and Trying to just be a bit of a go -getter when opportunities are not just presented to you. And in this particular case, it carried a lot of importance because when I did play for the teacher that day, he was pretty forthcoming about the fact that I did not have any chance of getting In at my current ability level, but he believed in me. He thought I had potential and that with the proper training, I might have a shot. And so he invited me to study at his summer music program that year for just, you know, five or so weeks. And so my mom and I packed up our bags and we went to Colorado and then we studied with him. And it was really only because of that training that I was able to pass the Juilliard audition in the fall. And so I'm really, I'm grateful for my mom's courage. I'm also grateful for the happenstance of it all. But since then, I have been the type of person that sends many a cold email and walks through physical doors and metaphorical doors because whatever fear I had around it was kind of beaten Out of me when I was a kid.

- Exploring Identity Through Change
  Summary:
  People who undergo significant change often experience a shift in their internal identity, leading them to question who they can become in the new circumstances.
  The podcast host initially focusing on change realized that the core theme was fundamentally about identity. Cognitive psychology introduces the concept of identity foreclosure, where individuals prematurely settle on an identity without exploring all possibilities.
  During adolescence, societal influences play a significant role in shaping our identities, but part of growing up involves examining, trying on, and choosing which identity labels or roles feel authentic and which ones we want to reject or embrace.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And especially as I moved my interest towards this topic of change, right? In my podcast, A Slight Change of Plans, I interview people who have gone through just harrowing tales of change at times. And what you realize along the way is that they're not just telling you this external story of change. They're talking to you about something internal that shifted. And oftentimes it's the loss of an identity unexpectedly. And they're trying to figure out who they can be in the face of this change. And so fairly quickly after starting my show, I realized, wow, you know, I don't even know if this is a show about change. Is really a show fundamentally about identity. There's a concept in cognitive psychology called identity foreclosure, and it refers to the idea that we can prematurely commit to an identity before having fully explored all other Ways that we can be or the things that we want to be in this life. And this often happens in adolescence. So we see things modeled for us through our environment, through parents, through coaches, through teachers, through our community, right? We're often just spoon -fed certain identity labels or roles that we feel we should play. And part of the process of growing up is examining those labels for ourselves and trying them on for fit and figuring out which ones feel good and which ones don't and which ones we want To reject and which ones we want to embrace. ([Time 0:07:32](https://share.snipd.com/snip/09e9ee09-fdb9-43e1-8f69-227408fbe0b4))
    - **Note:** Change in peoples lives comes from external but also large internal change from loss of key identity. Identity foreclosure you go through an experience and it cuts off paths to you and you must accept those are gone. Identify foreclosure. When you build yourself around an identity we become teathered and we need to examine and try these labels on others give us to see if they still fit. Don’t attach identity to what you do but rather why you do it. Internal focus not external focus. Identity creates leverage but also dangerous. Find your root and meta identity and place identity in that. Identity is important that’s it’s expansive and malleable not fixed. We can prime identities that change our orientation to the external world for the worse. Identity is the story we tell ourselves by saying we’re non technical we can absolve ourselves of tasks. Create multifaceted identity. Meta layers of identity you can choose identities at different layers of abstraction and tap those when your busy you’re a hard worker then you take a step back and you could be a caring person. Identity can give us ready made answers to questions and close us off to certain thought. We shouldn’t let saying we’re a political party like dem close us off from viewing the Republican stance and accepting it. The person who delivers a message or how it’s framed has a large impact on acceptance. Strengthen positive relationships avoid telling people not to do things because they often forget the not. Create positive associations. Do goals more powerful than do not goals. Doing things where you have more agency ie your choice your more likely to follow through on those ideas. Agency creates follow through.
- Expanding Identity: Embracing Change and Self-Reflection
  Summary:
  Identity can be shaped by experiences that limit opportunities, leading to disorientation and self-reflection.
  Anchoring identity to 'why' rather than 'what' can foster resilience and adaptability. By identifying the core passions and traits driving one's pursuits, individuals can find meaning in various endeavors, enhancing emotional connection and personal growth.
  Embracing expansive and flexible identities allows for continuous self-exploration and adaptation in the face of life's changes, revealing hidden resilience and untapped skills.
  Ultimately, identity is a narrative that can either limit growth or empower personal development.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  We can have what I would call change induced identity foreclosure where you go through an experience and it just naturally cuts off opportunities for you. And then you have to figure out what comes next. When I was 15, I certainly fell prey to this kind of foreclosure because I had built my entire self around the violin without exploring who else I could be. And so then when I lost it, I felt extremely disoriented. There is a potentially more robust and sustainable way to define yourself. So I don't think we're going to get rid of the human desire to identify with things in general, to have strong identities. They're a huge source of inspiration and focus and they can give us feelings of belonging and community. They can give us drive and motivation, right? If I define myself as a violinist, every morning when I wake up, I know what I want to do and I'm willing to commit to hours and hours of practice. The challenge becomes though when you anchor yourself to something that is precarious in some way and that's what I found with the violin. What I strive to do, because it's very much a works in progress, but I hope this resonates for your listeners, is to attach my sense identity and worth not to what I do, but to why I do it. So this has been an exercise in trying to understand, okay, Maya, you fell in love with the violin and you enjoyed it for so many reasons. What was it about the violin that was so intoxicating for you? What were the features that made you light up? And when I stripped away the superficial features of the violin and kind of looked under the surface, I realized that there were many traits and features of playing music that really Resonated with me, but in ways that transcended the violin. So I loved emotionally connecting with people through music. I loved the idea of honing a craft and slowly chipping away and getting better at something and witnessing that kind of progress. I loved having this kind of single -minded determination and these goals that I was chasing. It was possible for me to find those same features in other pursuits, right? If I just looked hard enough. So I could still find my love of human connection in other places. And in fact, I have, right? And being a cognitive scientist and now in having my podcast, A Slight Change of Plans, it's all about forging deep emotional connections with people, right? And I can witness progress in my role as an interviewer or in my role as a scientist. And so I would urge people to ask themselves, what is it that sits at the root of my passions in life? And can I find my meaning and worth and place my identity in that such that when life throws me a big change of plans, a massive curve ball, I can mourn that loss, sure, but I don't feel completely Disoriented because there's still so much of me that persists and that I can find expressions of in other mediums.
  Speaker 2
  As you're saying that, it's like we can identify our identity with a skill, we can do it with a habit, we can do it with something larger like Democrat or Republican, we can do it with something Still larger like American or Canadian or European, and can do it from what to why, which sort of makes me wonder what is identity.
  Speaker 1
  It's a deeply complicated philosophical question that people have been pondering for basically as long as we've been around. The way that I approach it actually is about expanding people's sense of self. Because I think what happens, especially as we get older, that we lock into an understanding of who we are, who we think we are. And it's often not totally accurate, and it's certainly not comprehensive. I mean, our sense of identity is formulated based on the quite random events that have occurred in our lives and the various ways in which we've been pressure tested or pushed or challenged. And we didn't choose that path, right, to reveal to us the maximum number of data points about ourselves. We were just living life and going through it and seeing what happened. And so I think because we have a first -person perspective on our minds, we sometimes believe that we have a very good understanding of who we are. And then what happens in the face of a change is it reveals to us all that remained hidden from you, right? All that existed that maybe didn't have a reason to be expressed before then, or the various ways in which we're more resilient, or the greater number of skills that we have, or the coping Mechanisms that we have at our disposal. And when I think about identity, I think we benefit from having more expansive identities and identities that feel more malleable, that don't feel fixed in ways that are problematic. As we navigate the many years of life that we have, we're willing to revisit and we're willing to re -examine and we're willing to see in a more flexible way.
  Speaker 2
  It feels like it can be limiting and empowering. It's almost like a thermos. It reinforces whatever you put into it. It doesn't have a judgment of a good or bad. But if we identify as a non -technical person or something, it's almost as if we absolve ourselves of the responsibility to learn and grow. So in a sense, as you were saying that, it's almost like our identity is the story we tell ourselves. ([Time 0:08:56](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fa209b0d-850c-4034-b558-ee7f978589ff))

- Building Multifaceted Identities to Achieve Goals
  Summary:
  Our perceived identity can greatly influence our actions and limit our potential when we label ourselves negatively.
  By embracing multifaceted identities, we can adapt to various challenges and changes in life without feeling a loss of self-worth. It's essential to have identity layers that can serve as a safe landing for us in difficult times, providing resilience and pragmatism.
  These layers can be chosen strategically based on the situation we are facing, enabling us to leverage our identity to accomplish our goals effectively.
  However, our self-assessments must be grounded in reality and open to feedback to ensure alignment with how others perceive us.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Absolutely. It's so well said and it's very much a narrative we tell ourselves. And to your point, it can be extremely limiting because when we in some ways like tight cast ourselves, let's say as being non -technical or as being not as social as other people or not As strong or physically, whatever it is, that can really hinder our progress because there is research on identity priming, which says that we do act in ways that are consistent with Our perceived identity or the identity we aspire to have. Right. So when we see ourselves as a voter, we're more likely to vote. When we see ourselves being eco -friendly, we're more likely to recycle. By the same token, if we see ourselves through these more negative labels, then we might also act in ways that align with that and needlessly hold ourselves back when it comes to making Progress. About kind of accountability. Like when you self -identify as say non -technical, you're off the hook of it, right? You don't have to try as much because you've just already decided that you fall into that bucket. And so you don't actually reach whatever growth potential you have in that area, because you kind of just written yourself off. That part really resonates with me. And I think that's an excellent point.
  Speaker 2
  Sort of hit on a little bit the risks of wrapping yourself with an instrument or I think that transfers to something like a profession. And if we're no longer able to do it, then it can cause sort of an identity crisis. Can that also be a plus? So I guess the sort of meta question is how can we use our identity to help us accomplish our goals?
  Speaker 1
  There are absolutely pros and pluses to anchoring ourselves to what we do. It also gives us a clear sense of a future that we can imagine, right? The future might look kind of blurry and amorphous and when you identify as having a certain profession, you can at least project what you think the next five years can look like. And so there's definitely benefits to anchoring yourself and identity. And that's why I don't want us to do away with that concept altogether. What I'm proposing is having multifaceted identities. So you have multiple layers of abstraction when it comes to where you derive meaning and how you define yourself. And so at one level, you can absolutely say, okay, I'm a lawyer, I'm a doctor, a stay -at -home mom, I'm a tech worker. And then you can have deeper layers of identity that can be your safe landing, you know, almost like a parachute, when life throws you a change that you can fall back on so that when that Thing maybe is threatened for whatever reason, I mean, maybe you get into an accident and you don't have the same abilities that you had before. You get a chronic illness that prevents you from doing those things. You don't feel that your entire self -worth has been stripped away in the process. That is destabilizing in a way that I think is counterproductive. And I'm always trying to be a pragmatist about things and figure out, okay, what are the ways that we can try to show as much resilience as possible in these moments. And so I do think that you can try to build identity layers, if you will. And depending on the moment in your life that you're engaging in and the challenges that you're being thrown, you can almost opportunistically choose that level of abstraction, right? You can choose the layer at which you want to self -identify. It's possible that in the moment at your job, it's not that helpful to think of yourself as, oh, I'm the type of person who loves connecting with people because you have a really annoying Work assignment that's due in five hours. And that's not going to be sufficiently motivating, right? And so that's where you might call upon the stricter label, which is just what you do.
  Speaker 2
  I like that because it's sort of like you can turn identity into whatever you want to help you accomplish your goals.
  Speaker 1
  As long as it's not delusional. So I really don't, I'm not okay with people telling themselves stories that are simply advantageous or promote psychological well -being, right? They have to be rooted in reality. They have to be to some degree vetted by the people in your life. If you identify as like an extremely compassionate person, but then the people around you don't feel that way about you, it's worth potentially revisiting and updating. So I really do feel like we need to allow in feedback in those spaces and just make sure that whatever our self -assessment is, is at least in part rooted in evidence that we're collecting About ourselves along the way.

- Effectively Engaging in Challenging Conversations
  Summary:
  In challenging conversations, it is crucial to approach with genuine curiosity, avoiding undermining the other person's humanity.
  By increasing the question to statement ratio and validating their perspectives through restating and questioning, progress in mindset change can be made. Encouraging the other person to consider what evidence would change their beliefs can open them up to the possibility of evolving opinions.
  Additionally, exploring how they formed their views can reveal flaws in their reasoning and help them see the biases that influenced their perspective.
  It is essential to remember that the goal is not just to change their minds but to also be open to adjusting one's own viewpoint, aiming for a conversation where both parties leave with slightly altered perspectives.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So that proverbial like Thanksgiving dinner where you're sitting down and there's an uncle there and you disagree with them and in the past you've just kind of given up and been like, This is not worth it. There is research in psychology which shows how we can make more progress in those situations. And this is known in the research as motivational interviewing or deep canvassing. And they use this in the context of, you know, political campaigns and trying to see if people can make progress on convincing people change their minds on important political or social Issues. So there's a couple key features of motivational interviewing that are good to consider here. So one is the same way that I talked in the context of moral reframing as you don't want to undermine the other person's fundamental sense of humanity, because that's just going to close The door immediately, right? If you're starting a conversation with me, Shane, and you're like, I think you're a terrible person, chances are, I'm not going to get very far, right? So you want to try as hard as you possibly can to show as much genuine curiosity for the person's views. You might find them abhorrent, but you want to understand how it is that they arrived at those views. How did they get from point A to point B? And try to at least express curiosity for the journey. Oh, maybe they were born into a family where their grandparents all thought this thing, or maybe they were bullied in school, and so they felt that the only way they could really belong Was joining X or Y community group, whatever it is, right? You want to just show curiosity, and that will at least invite more of a conversation rather than just simply a confrontation. The other thing and this relates to this curiosity point is you want to increase your question to statement ratio. So one thing that we can often do in these contexts is simply just tell people what we think they should think, right? We just come out the gate being like, well, this is how it actually is and this is what the data shows and it feels authoritative in a way that's often just not conducive to actual mindset Change. And so instead you want to increase the number of questions that you're asking and try to keep statements more to a minimum. And then when the person shares their point of view back with you, again, you might find it to be totally at odds with your life philosophy or the way you think about the world, it can be Really validating helpful to restate in your own words what they just said to you, so that you can at least validate that they've been heard. Again, you disagree with them, but you're saying, I'm listening to you, I'm understanding what you're saying, I'm going to rephrase what I just heard you say. And can open people's minds, right? The technique at that point that's really helpful is you can ask them a pretty powerful question, which is, hey, so you believe this thing. What evidence do you think you would need in order to change your mind about that thing? And what I love about that question is that it just presupposes that they ought to be willing to change their mind in the face of new evidence, right? You're kind of like putting them on the hook for at least acknowledging that there could be something in theory that could change their minds. Now, you might be talking to someone who is particularly resolute and stubborn in their views and they could say, literally, no evidence could change my mind. That's the point at which you stop the conversation and you may be focused on the cornbread and you get back to your Thanksgiving dinner. But for most people, they might say, if I learned that these three things were true, I might be willing to change my mind. And that is progress. Even just the identification of what those things are is very, very meaningful. And I think you can engage with them on those things. You can also ask them how they believe they arrived at their views, right? So that they can actually see that there was maybe some randomness in how they arrived at their views. Like, how did you get from point A to point B? Oh, actually, it turns out that I was just really over anchoring on what my friend told me at school that one day, or, you know, what my colleague said about this article that they read. And they can find holes in their own arguments when they have to trace that path and realize it wasn't the result of really clear, disciplined, rational, scientific thinking. But like everyone, myself included, we arrive at our views for a variety of reasons. And our minds are shaped for all sorts of reasons that aren't always totally sound. And we should also, of course, use these same tactics on ourselves, right? So we tend to believe going into these conversations that our only job is to change their minds, when in actuality, we might be a little blind to the holes in our logic. And we might benefit having a slightly more open mind going in because it's actually okay to leave the conversation in which both people have changed their point of view just a little Bit, right? That would be potentially an excellent outcome for the conversation. ([Time 0:28:20](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5650a528-1764-4860-8d62-28ea5b4b358c))

- Setting Sustainable Goals with Emergency Reserves
  Summary:
  Framing goals in proactive behaviors rather than abstinence, such as committing to run half a mile daily, is easier to track and more motivating.
  Building in 'emergency reserves' or 'get out of jail free cards' into goal setting allows for flexibility and acknowledges that setbacks are normal. By bridging the empathy gap between present and future selves, setting aspirational identities can be more sustainable and achievable.
  Avoid setting overly ambitious goals that may lead to discouragement and instead focus on continuous progress towards the goal.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Sounds like a step forward. Let's say I have a goal to run a marathon next year and I'm not currently a runner. How can I use identity as a means to accomplish that goal?
  Speaker 1
  There is some research showing that you do want to frame your goals in terms of do behaviors versus don't behaviors. So you would kind of acknowledge this before. It's much more easy to measure progress when we're engaging in proactive decisions or proactive behaviors, rather than the abstinence of things. You say, okay, I want to be a runner. I'm going to start by running half a mile every day. That's going to be easier to track than, I'm not going to sit on my couch for as long, right? It's like that's a really hard thing to measure and also just doesn't feel as inspiring or motivating. When it comes to identity, I actually think that we talked a lot about wiggle room in identity and thinking of our identities as slightly more malleable and trying not to have a purity Complex about it. And I think that applies to goal setting as well. So we can, especially at the outset of goal setting, be wildly ambitious about what it is that we want to accomplish. And we can have that purity complex where if we don't abide by the rules, let's say of our first week or our second week, we just fall off the wagon because we think, okay, well, we already Kind of screwed this up, so what's the point? And that can be really counterproductive. And so there is research showing that when we introduce what are known as emergency reserves into our goal setting, basically get out of jail free cards into the process of goal setting, We're much more likely to stay the course and to reach those goals. So for example, let's say I want to run 3k or whatever, 5k in however many weeks, you actually build in six days along the way where you don't actually run for whatever reason. You got sick, you have to drop your kids off at school, you don't feel like it. That's okay too. But you're basically bridging an empathy gap that exists between you and your future self when you're building in that emergency reserve. You're acknowledging that real life is going to happen and that when I don't run that one day, it is not a threat to this future or present identity of runner. It is a expected and pseudo welcome part of the process because it's a more sustainable way to achieve your goals. So one mistake we can make is on a Sunday at 4 p .m. When we're laying on the couch watching TV, we think to ourselves, okay, I'm going to get at that 4 a .m. Every morning and I'm going to work out at 4 a .m. And when push comes to shove, of course, we're at a very different state in that moment and we often have a really hard time sticking to those goals. And that's another example of an empathy gap between our present selves and our future selves, which can be very problematic. And so if you are up at 4 a .m. And you are at the gym working out, that's a reasonable moment to say, I'm going to try to keep doing this for however many days I can manage, right? But I think that's another way that you can set goals in ways that really don't feel like you're threatening, you're aspirational. Because what we're talking about here are aspirational identities, right? And we don't want to get in our own way at the time where we're actually setting the goals such that we make less progress than we could. And so we can take these factors into account at the outset.
  Speaker 2
  I love that. ([Time 0:32:55](https://share.snipd.com/snip/042c295a-4b66-4be3-84ec-04d387f6351e))

- Designing Environments for Success and Motivation Techniques
  Summary:
  Designing our environments can help us avoid relying on willpower by making desirable options more accessible.
  Motivation tends to peak at the beginning and end of goal pursuit but dip in the middle, so setting shorter goals helps navigate through this low motivation phase. Temptation bundling involves pairing an undesirable task with a desirable one, allowing the rewarding activity only during the undesired task to create a motivating association.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I know Angela Duckworth focuses a lot on this. So that we don't have to employ willpower, we should really focus on the way that we design our lives and the choice architecture of our lives. What this means in practice is to the extent that you can control your environment, you just make things unavailable to you. And you make other things really readily accessible and available to you. So the canonical example of this is cafes where they try to encourage healthy eating. They put all the junk food at the bottom and they're in opaque containers and then they put the healthy food like the fruits and vegetables and healthy snacks on full display at eye level. So it's the things you're more likely to grab. And those little are actually quite effective and they don't require as much willpower because you've just architected your environment accordingly. And so that's what I would recommend in situations like that. And then the other thing we know, Shane, about motivation is that we don't have stable amounts of motivation over the course of goal pursuit. This is some research by my friend, Ayelet Fishbach. She it the middle problem. So basically what happens is we have a huge burst of motivation at the outside of a goal. We all can resonate with this, right? January 1st, the lines to the gym are long. And then like January 20th, all of a sudden they start to wane, right? So we all enter goal pursuit with a lot of enthusiasm and excitement. And then we also find actually that towards the end of goal pursuit, as we're reaching the end, we experience monotonic increases in motivation. It was called the goal gradient effect, where as we get closer to the goal, we get even more motivated and excited about it. But there's a lull in the middle. So that's the problem, right? It's like you see, ooh, there's like a dip in the motivation. And I think we all have the lived experience of this, right? It's like, oh, my gosh, I was so excited in the first three weeks of this thing. And now I'm kind of losing steam. So what Ielle recommends is to actually just make the middle periods of time as short as physically possible. So rather than setting a year long goal, which we might feel an instinct to do, because we want to set a really ambitious goal. And so we're like, let's make it a year -long goal because then I can really achieve the best version of this thing that I have my site set on. Instead, you set week -long goals. So that way, the middle period is not a multi -month period. It's actually just a few days in the middle of the week, right? And you can get away with a day or two of not working very hard, right? And then climbing your way back out on say that final day of low motivation. And so I really like this idea of trying to, from a temporal perspective, kind of like bound your motivational cycles so that you can experience this dip in a more constrained space.

  It's almost like you're a marathoner and you hit a wall and you're sort of at like mile 10. And instead of focusing on the finish line, you focus on how do I get around the next corner. And then you accomplish that goal and then you focus on the next corner. So you shorten the distance between where you are and what you want to accomplish.
  Speaker 1
  Exactly. I want to share the one motivational technique that I use like every single day of my life. Please do. Most transformative for me. So this is from my friend Katie Milkman at the University of Pennsylvania. She calls it temptation bundling. The idea is very simple actually, but what you do is you pair a desirable task with an undesirable task. So something that you have to do, right? So let's say have to unload the dishwasher. You have to fold laundry. You have to get some sort of work assignment done. You have to work out. Whatever the thing is that you have a little bit of dread towards is the undesirable task. That's the thing that needs to actually happen. And then you pair it with a desirable activity that offers you more of an immediate reward. Okay, so this might be, okay, while I'm folding laundry, I listen to my favorite pop album that just came out, or while I'm on the treadmill, I'm watching Netflix, or while I am doing this Really tough work assignment, I'm treating myself to my favorite candy. And the key part, the only way in which this temptation bundling works is if you actively deny yourself that rewarding activity in all other domains of life so that it really feels special And it feels coupled with the undesirable activity. So I can't be watching Netflix all the time and then feel motivated to go on the treadmill to just watch more Netflix, right? I have to choose, say, a show where it's like you can only watch the show you're on the treadmill. You can only listen to this pop album when you're folding laundry. You can only eat this candy when you're working on writing your book, whatever the thing is, right? And I have found this to be such a game changer because you get really swept up in what happens with, for me, shitty reality TV shows. And I really want to know what happens. And so I do feel a pull to go back to doing the undesirable thing just because I'm so eager to see what happens in the plot line. And so that one has been really effective for me. But again, you have to, you do have to be very rule -based here, which is that you can't indulge in that thing in other spaces.
