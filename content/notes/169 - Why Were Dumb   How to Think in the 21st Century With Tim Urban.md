### Highlights

- Conservatives and progressives' different views towards the House
  Key takeaways:
  - Conservatives in the House tend to focus on the positives and resist change, while also upholding the constitution and supporting the House
  - People in the center tend to have moderate views and also support the House
  - There are movements (such as 'wokeness') that are more revolutionary and seek to disrupt the House

  Speaker 1
  Meanwhile, you also have, you know, conservatives in the house and they're more likely rather than look at the ways the house's flaw to look at the ways that it's good and that the ways that progressive ideas and progressive ideas for change might erode the support beams in the house. So their goal is to stand up for the kind of in a lot of cases, the status quo or even how things used to be and say, inevitably, some things are eroding in the house. And that's what they look for. You know, where do we not have the right values that we used to have? And but they also, they had the same goal. The constitution should be upheld and that the liberal house is good, right? And people on the center are going to have, you know, a little bit of both are going to be more moderate. All of those people are prohouse. Okay. And that's an important thing to distinguish. Now, there are also movements right now that are outside the house with wrecking balls. These are movements who believe they're much more revolutionary. So what people call wokeness, right? I call it social justice fundamentalism, which is fundamentally different than liberal social justice, which is the Martin Luther King style that I just described. Social justice fundamentalism is my term for less kind of culture war baggage late in term than wokeness. But it is fundamentally different in that it's outside the house with a wrecking ball. And it stems from, and this is, by the way, all Marxist and neo-Marxist and all of its descendants, you know, all these movements, what they have in common is they say, no, no, no, everyone in the house, you're missing the big point. The house itself is rotten to the core. Liberalism is bad. ([Time 0:31:36](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5c996e74-8e27-487c-a298-db5e0c593b82))
    - **Note:** Seeing the way liberal values are being carried out as wrong vs liberal values being wrong and we need new institutions and that’s what communism is.
- The Merging of Neo-Marxism and Postmodernism in Social Justice Fundamentalism
  Key takeaways:
  - Social justice fundamentalism merges neo-Marxist mentality with postmodernism.
  - Postmodernism rejects the concept of modernity, science, and objective truth as meta-narratives through which oppression flows.
  - Woke scholars often believe in rejecting the existence of objective truth and embracing lived experience as the only way to understand certain truths.

  Speaker 1
  But the thing about social justice fundamentalism that's different from a lot of other Marxist ideologies, they go a step further because most Marxists actually use would still say level one is good. They actually they believe in science and objective truth. They just think that liberalism is a misguided system of government. Social justice fundamentalism merges kind of the neo-Marxist mentality with postmodernism. So postmodernism is a set of philosophies that emerged in the 60s, 70s and 80s. A lot of them in Europe and France and came over to the US. And this is, this goes a step further and says actually even what we're calling modernity, science and objective truth, all of that is actually just a meta narrative. And it's a meta narrative through which oppression flows. They actually would say we need to reject that too. We need to reject this concept. So you'll often hear kind of in woke scholars and they'll say stuff like there is no such thing as an objective truth. They say stuff like my truth, right? Your truth. And that lived experience is the only way to understand certain truths. And it almost goes back to the concept of different denominations of truth from the past is that black Americans are women or LGBTQ people. They have a lens, they actually have access to different denominations of truth that other people can't see. Right? This is a very postmodern and it actually a very pre modern concept. So it's an explicit rejection of this idea of modernity. ([Time 0:35:25](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4e7e63a2-db8c-4fef-8ec6-23d3be088150))
    - **Note:** Reject peoples beliefs of objective truth for subjective truth. Post modernism there is no truth with tearing down the house leads to chaos.
- Changing societal attitudes towards interracial marriage and free speech
  Key takeaways:
  - In 1959, almost everyone believed interracial marriage was immoral. Today, 94% of people believe it's fine and 6% still consider it immoral.
  - If certain people were given the power to decide which ideas could be aired in 1959, interracial marriage and gay rights would have likely been deemed dangerous or inappropriate topics.
  - Free speech prevailed and allowed us to challenge our previous misconceptions about these topics.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  4% of people thought it was okay. It was the 96% of people weren't bad people, right? They weren't racist, bad people. It's that that's just what we all thought. That's what almost everyone thought and almost everyone you know would have thought interracial marriage is not moral. Today, the number is 94% think it's fine and 6% think it's immoral, right? So that is the entire country has changed its mind. But if you went back to 1959 and said, you know what, certain people we were going to let you decide no dangerous ideas will be aired anymore. You decide which ones almost everyone. Well, one of the dangerous ideas on their list would have been interracial marriage is good. So no one would have been able to speak that same with gay rights. Gay rights would have been a no-go in 1959. Almost everyone would have said, well, that we definitely don't want to be spoken. We don't want kids hearing about gay rights, right? That's sodomy, it's whatever. And today, I think we're pretty happy that free speech prevail because we were wrong. And so the kind of underlying assumption when people today think, you know, free speech allows dangerous ideas to flourish is this idea that, well, all the people in the past, they had bad ideas. But today, it's all clear. We figured it out. People in 50 years will not look back on us and say, wow, they were really morally wrong about a bunch of things or just their knowledge was off. But actually, they'll say that, nope, they had it. Right. Of course, that's not true. Right. So free speech, I almost refuse to still man the case against it because I just think that the only alternative is powerful people censoring everyone else.

    - **Note:** Free speech is important because we’re wrong about so much we just don’t know what
- The Importance of Dispassionate Thinking and Emotional Awareness in Crypto
  Key takeaways:
  - Ideas should be attacked, not people
  - Primitive mind thinking attacks people and cannot be convinced otherwise
  - Crypto bull markets can be highly emotional experiences
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And they're actually just trying to figure out what's true. And they attack ideas. They don't attack people and they don't get offended or angry when someone says they're wrong. And which are doing it the primitive mind way. And they attack people, you know, they will actually try to punish people for saying the wrong thing. And you know, a sign of someone thinking with their primitive mind is you know, there's nothing you could say or show them. No piece of evidence that would make them say, you know what, I guess I'm wrong about that. I need to rethink that. So it's important to just, it's nice once you have that in your head, you could start to notice this axis alongside all the what you think axes of the world.
  Speaker 2
  Anyone who's just been through the last crypto bull market knows that these things are very emotional experiences, especially when there's a lot of money to be made. There's a lot of wealth that's on the line. ([Time 1:07:08](https://share.snipd.com/snip/18500c60-760a-452c-802f-e8509977209f))
    - **Note:** Tribalness and being willing to change your mind and question your beliefs.
- The Dangers of Low Rung Thinking
  Key takeaways:
  - Low rung thinking blocks learning and leads to repeated mistakes.
  - Asking oneself if there is anything that would make them say they are wrong can help identify low rung thinking.
  - Getting irrationally angry when someone disagrees may indicate low rung thinking.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Well, I think partially is just being like even just having this ladder is a concept in your head, because no one wants to be on the low rungs, right? When you're on the low rungs, you're delusional. You are letting kind of primitive emotions make your decisions. You're completely blocked from learning new things. You will continue to make the same mistake over and over because of stubborn kind of insistence that you're right. So it's not good for the person who suffers most from low rung thinking is the low rung thinker. And so I think, you know, there are signs of course, when you're doing this, if you can ask yourself, is there anything that would make me say I'm wrong about this? If the answer is no, okay, I think I'm like caught up in kind of like a religious fervor here. I think I am caught up in like a tribal craze at this moment. And you can also say, you know, do I get kind of irrationally angry when someone disagrees with me on this? When I see something, you know, that tells me, you know, the people who disagree with me, do I hate to them? You know, these are all signs that you are doing that thing that all humans do, right? It does not doesn't mean you're a bad person. It doesn't mean you're a dumb person. Everyone does it, right? And it just means, oh, I've slipped down on the ladder. And just having that thought right there, boom, you're already up a few runs just having that thought. Because when you're really down in the ladder, you don't know you're doing it. You are totally lost in it. And so a little bit of self reflection can go a long way. And then of course, you know, what's the best way to help yourself here is surround yourself with other people that value high rung thinking, even if they don't use that term, they just happen to be there. So there again, as a group, you still will sometimes slip down, but you will find that like it can be like a support group. If you have people that tend to not identify with ideas, where the group itself likes to disagree, right? If the group is always agreeing on everything, I think you're you've fallen into a low rung echo chamber, which is again, collaborative low rung thinking. A high rung group, which I would call an idea lab is kind of the opposite of an echo chamber is just a place where people attack ideas, but not people. It's a place where disagreeing is cool. We're humility. We're saying I don't know makes you seem smart, not wishy washy or dumb, where people change their minds and where people disagree for sport. And argument doesn't mean you're in a fight. And it's yeah. And when you're in an echo chamber, you can see it where it's like, wow, everyone agrees. And we're having way too much fun agreeing and talking about how bad the other people are. ([Time 1:09:49](https://share.snipd.com/snip/97e6ca70-e0c7-4f97-b131-504daa2e364e))
    - **Note:** The ladder and high wrung and low rung thinking. Attack ideas disagree often not constant consensus.
- Unpacking the Mental Models in What's Our Problem Book
  Key takeaways:
  - The speaker recommends Tim's book called What's Our Problem
  - The book covers mental models for better thinking and avoiding echo chambers
  - Echo chambers may be powerful in the short run but are long term bearish
  - The speaker discusses algorithms and the possibility of rewarding high rung thinking
  - Max Techmark made a comment about web to algorithms being like tests
  Transcript:
  Speaker 3
  Guys, there's so much more here to unpack. And it's all included in Tim's book, which I totally recommend. It is called What's Our Problem. We'll include a link to it in the show notes, but the mental models here, we only got through half of the agenda.
  Speaker 2
  Yeah, it's just like we have so much more left in the book.
  Speaker 3
  So guys, this is all about how you can think better in the society and how you can make sure you are a high rung thinker, how you can avoid echo chambers, echo chambers. I got to say, they're powerful in the short run, but they are long term bearish. Okay, if you want to accomplish something over the long run. But Tim, I know we don't have too much time, but I really need to pick your brain on this before we leave. We're just talking about algorithms and kind of web to and how like you're hopeful that we can start to reward high rung thinking with our algorithms. I just heard Max Techmark make some comment. I think he was maybe quoting someone else that basically the web to algorithms were like our test show for AI, right? ([Time 1:17:29](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fe89be6f-cc03-4f21-883c-789f78eba970))
    - **Note:** Web2 Lagos we’re our test for AI and we failed those miserably.
