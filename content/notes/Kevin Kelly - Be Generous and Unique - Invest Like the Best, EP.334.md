### Highlights

- The Lifelong Project of Becoming Yourself
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  There's just a whole lot to unpack in this, and it does sum up a lot of what I'm trying to do. So the first thing is, I don't think anybody who has achieved this. I've met a lot of people who are absolutely in that direction and are absolutely approaching that. It's like an asymptote curve where you never actually get there. There's always some way to get a little bit closer, but from a distance, you might say, well, you've arrived. And for most of us, this is a very, very high bar, truly becoming yourself is an incredibly high bar, because we were opaque to ourselves. We were just built in a way that we don't have immediate access, even with language, to what it is that we do and how we do it and our own motivations. And it's kind of like we're deliberately kept out of it, so we don't mess it up too much. This is a lifelong project for most people, is coming to understand what it is that's authentic about you, what it is that you do better than other people, what it is that you're about, what your purpose in life is. This is a lifelong project. And the best we can do is to say that we are getting closer. ([Time 0:03:42](https://share.snipd.com/snip/eb8cd2f9-de5f-498d-873e-18621d142474))
    - **Note:** Meaning of life is to say on your deathbed you have become yourself. What are you trying to optimize for in your life and what’s your unique differentiation. Understand what you’re about and aim that way and tell other people as well so they know be clear on your brand with your authentic self. You shouldn’t look to other definitions for success in life but find your own. What causes others to fail is they conform to others version of success not their own which is failure. What you want may not be what others want but you can only become yourself with the help of others. You need others to help guide your faults. Prototype don’t plan your life plans are deterministic while life is non linear you can’t simulate life you need to have a high level plan then adjust as it plays out. You lose too much complexity in simulation. Start somewhere master something then iterate. Thinking is important but don’t let thinking replace doing.
- The Reward for Good Work is More Work
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  You want to, true area like this, will be ahead of language and having to create new terms, new words, new things.
  Speaker 2
  So you can't describe it well or easily.
  Speaker 1
  Right. And so that's another sign that it's worth paying attention to.
  Speaker 2
  I love those ideas. They're beautiful. The other cut at this that I love, maybe my second favorite thing in the book after that opening quote that we explored is this notion that the reward for good work is more work. When I read that, people are annoyed at me now for not shutting up about this idea. How did that manifest for you? Like, where did you come upon that idea? What does it mean to you? Like, how did it play out in your own life? Absolutely above that idea.
  Speaker 1
  So it's related to another piece of advice in the book, which is I actually talked with this with David Allen, the Get Things Done guy, which is that there's a kind of a mispreciation or misunderstanding about productivity, which is that a lot of people who are productivity focused will be trying to minimize the amount of time they spend on working on something. But actually, what you really want to be doing is you want to be finding things that you want to spend as much time as possible working on. That's this idea, like the reward for work is more work is you want to be doing something where the goal is to spend more time doing it. Yes, productivity is fine. But what you're trying to do is actually move your time so that you are trying to spend ([Time 0:21:03](https://share.snipd.com/snip/502abfac-7264-4c91-80e6-14efc854b5f9))
    - **Note:** The reward for work is more work. finding something you love so you want to keep doing it. Money is a weight and distorting and too much is more bad then good. Money isn’t the gating factor in much of success. A lack of resource enabled or even mandates creativity. Most of imagination is letting go of preconceived notion. Imagination requires you to be like a sculptor and remove things. Seeing things from different perspectives like innovation/lateral thinking with whithered technology works as well.
- "The Rule of Three" for Active Listening in Marriage according to Esther Peral
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  What about in a marriage specifically? So setting aside the parent-child relationship, well, obviously that's critical, but just purely at the level of spouses. In the same general vein, exercises, rituals, whatever, anything that you have done or would recommend people think about?
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, I'm not very good. I think you need to talk to Esther Peral, who is in this couples therapy. Actually, there was one thing in the book that I think came from Esther, which is the rule of three in conversation. And that's particularly valuable in the marriage, which is that when something that you love or intimate with is telling you something in a very intense way, you want to be listening. And then when they're done, wait until they're done, you say, is there more? And there's usually more. And then they go, Rick, second round, you listen all the way through. This is active listening, meaning that you are engaged. You are not just a recording machine. You're probing. You're encouraging. And then you wait until there's a third round of is ([Time 0:39:11](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b98cec29-9e38-4c1d-b24a-051fbe1ef483))
    - **Note:** Creating rituals for stability in relationships is important especially for families. When someone is talking wait until they’re done then ask them if there is more 3x. Before you say something ask if it’s true necessary and kind. Resume vs eulogy virtues. There is nothing more selfish then being kind. If you lose something put it where you first looked for it. If you wouldn’t do something tomorrow don’t agree to it if it were in a month. Go 7 levels deep in research.
- The Value of Articulating Actions and Understanding the Technium
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I don't know about other people, but I find that I actually don't know why I do things. And I don't know exactly how I would describe what I'm doing or whatever. And that this process required me to articulate things and it brought more understanding of what my path is and where I'm going. And so it didn't really change it as much as it illuminated it. And that illumination is valuable. And so I have a better idea about what it is I'm doing than before I started.
  Speaker 2
  I'd love to spend a minute or two just having the benefit of having you on the call to ask about your conception of technology. Before reading this book, like I said, I've been preparing this for a long time because I read all your other books about technology. Your notion of the technium has been very influential on me and how I think about how I spend my time and how I invest and everything else. How do you think about the history of technology and the stock of the technium, the stock of technology that exists in the world? And why that's such a natural extension of human beings?
  Speaker 1
  In brief, the main insight about the technium, which is my term or the systems of all the technologies in the world, is the understanding that they don't stand alone. The durable web that you can't make a hammer without a saw. The saw cuts the handle and the hammers needed to make the saw. And so they're all codependent. ([Time 0:45:59](https://share.snipd.com/snip/67fe93c3-e594-4a1b-8f6c-f05bf87a864b))
    - **Note:** Technology doesn’t stand alone but it’s a technium which is a complex adaptive system of technology. A hammer needs a saw and a saw needs a hammer. Ecosystem of codependent tech the bigger it gets the more bias and complexity is added. The tendencies of technology have the same through line and goals as the other existing complex systems like life and evolution. Deep similarity between complex systems. Technology in the end brings more possibilities to the universe. Most of the world is nothing but there is a small section trending towards invention improbable innovation. We’re trying to be more low probability because that leads to more creativity and reach deutche popper. Learning and evolution are analogous and AI just speeds this up more. We haven’t been able to unlock deduction or symbolic reasoning only pattern recognition so far so there is a lot more room in AI. Intelligence is sufficient but not absolute to get things done in the world.
- The Challenges of Being Pioneers in New Categories and the Benefits of Being Unique and Generous
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  But the advantage that we had at Wired was that we didn't have any other. We were so only at the time, there was nothing else like it. And it was hard because trying to sell advertising was impossible in the beginning. And there was no category. Wired didn't fit into any category. It was like an incredibly difficult sell. News stands when it carry out because there was no category. Word reputs this magazine. No, no, it's not computer magazine. It's technology lifestyle magazine. What's that? There's no category for there. So it's hard. It's really hard to be the only in that sense. But if you can, the rewards are very, very high. And I think that's where you want to aim. Your life, your family, your company, country.
  Speaker 2
  I think it's amazing that the advice in the book is somehow both counterintuitive and obvious. And just like to sum up what I take from this, the smartest strategy, even if you're trying to be selfish is to be generous and unique. And almost everyone does the opposite of those two things, which is totally bizarre. It's also a wonderful excuse to ask you the same question. Now I've asked, I guess, perching 500 times now I've asked every single guest I've ever talked to. What is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you?
  Speaker 1
  When I think of kindness, I think of a moment many, many, many, many years ago when I was traveling in ([Time 1:03:10](https://share.snipd.com/snip/31172877-6374-44d1-857c-081f543ac43b))
    - **Note:** Don’t aim to be the best aim to be the only. What is your 1/1 differentiation and give away everything else. The best writing is a magnification of the editor Apple is Steve Jobs with 10k lives. Simplify the message you’re trying ti deliver then exaggerate it. The best strategy even if you’re trying to be self is too be generous and unique.
