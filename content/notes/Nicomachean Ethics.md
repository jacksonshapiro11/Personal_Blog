### Highlights

- More virtuous to do what is noble rather than avoid vice. Liberal man gives readily rather than taking. Creates value helps others he does this with joy not pain. The liberal man wants to give in the right way to the right people giving in excess is as bad as not giving. Good giving happens balanced in the right way. A man obsessed with gain is bad virtue isn’t lending at high rates but doing what is right in the situation. The most valuable possession is worth most but the most valuable art is that which is great and beautiful. Spend what is becoming of you. A virtuous man wants what he deserves nothing more or less not too humble or too proud. Realistic and balanced. The proud man views the world justly and balanced. Praise or insults from unworthy men mean likewise little. Balanced lifestyle in all regards. Take the mean in a situation not too one sided on any argument that is true to his character. You can’t feel disgrace for involuntary actions.

    - **Note:** This is all about the golden mean. Embracing virtue avoiding vice. Creates value and spreads joy not pain. Gives in a balanced way to others spend what is becoming of you. Deserve what you want. Don’t get insulted by little men.
- Fearing the right things for the right motives is the mark of bravery and likewise with other virtues. Good life motto is balance virtue bravery isn’t being a coward but it’s not being rash either. A man who can’t swim should fear the water but an Olympic swimmer fearing the water is cowardice. Courage is facing what you know is painful without reserve. It’s not hard to feel safe when you’re outnumbering the opponent but itvis when you’re outnumbered. Self indulgent men see nothing as enough but temperate man see the right balance need to be struck and too much self indulgence is actually bad. Pleasure seeking and pain avoidance are both horrible things but pleasure seeking is worse and less understandable temperance is living a balanced life.

    - **Note:** This is the concept of the gold mean we need to balance all virtues, and this balance is different for different people. Certain people should fear things when other shouldn’t. Just be mindful of who we are.
- Men can act voluntarily or involuntarily. We have choice in our actions which is related to the right object but may not actually accomplish a just goal vs an opinion which can be just. We deliberate on means not ends. Everyone wants an investment that makes money but we argue about what that might be. Assume the end and then find the means. Virtue is in our means it’s in our power to be virtuous or vicious through our acts and means. No one is involuntarily happy but people are voluntarily wicked. No one is encouraged to do what is in our power or voluntary whatever men ought to know is theirs to know they can’t claim ignorance for not knowing the effects of alcohol you need agency over yourself. Acting constantly with a state of character in mind is a choice. If you act unjustly you are unjust. Virtues and vices are in part voluntary so we are responsible for our character somethings are out of our control like looks but not others like weight.

    - **Note:** We have agency over our lives and must take thoughtful action. We must act with virtue everyone debates means, but no one debates ends. We could be voluntarily wicked but not voluntarily happy we need to take agency to be happy. Invert problems. You can’t claim ignorance because you drank too much or did something else that you had a chance of knowing the effects. You are what you continuously do if you act unjust, you are unjust. Virtues and vices. Anti victim mindset.
- We acquire virtues by and live with nature. It is from the same causes and means every virtue is created and destroyed the good musician plays the same thing as the bad musician. The difference is practice and we thus must practice virtue every day in order to be virtuous. Our habits shape our behavior. Defect and excess destroy virtues. You need temperance and courage to be balanced with excess. The good man must do just acts and effectively balance pleasure and pain. We must do just acts to be just not just talk about them. Virtue is the act of the intermediate balancing good and bad. There is too little and too much courage but there is no intermediate in adultery. Some extremes are more alike than the intermediate. We should stay toward the intermediate but sometimes we must skew more toward one side or the other especially to counteract our natural inclinations

    - **Note:** Virtue comes only through a constant practice and work. The golden mean sometimes we need to skew to one side to counteract out natural tendencies ie overcommunicating. You need temperance and courage to balance with excess. Balance pleasure and pain like frankle. Gat action dont just pontificate. Sometimes extremes are more similar to each other at opposite ends. Some beliefs have no happy medium.
      Life is practice/ practice virtue, golden mean, get action virtues rooted in nature honed through balanced practice. extremes are like each other
- We should pursue good means to good ends. We should only accept precision to the extend that science allows it we’d expect a mathematician to be more accurate than a logician. A man is a good judge after he conducts are careful inquiry into a subject remaining ignorant and youthful to a subject produces no good ends just action and pride not learning. Ends can be in pleasure or virtue what is the essentially good end we are looking for in life. There are ends and final ends the end to architecture may be building a house or wealth. Proximate vs root ends. Final end is good in it of itself like happiness. There is no end to happiness it is an end in itself. Happiness is the ultimate virtue but happiness is different for different people. Happiness to a carpenter may be different than a musician. Human good is activity of soul in accordance with virtue. If more than one virtue than the most complete virtue in a complete life not just one good summer. Our main task must not be subordinated to minor questions start with first principles then abstract from there. We must investigate first principles because without a strong base we have nothing. Happiness comes from a life lived with virtue happiness is a result of a good lie structured doing what you were meant to do and living with virtue. The happy man makes the best of what he is given like a shoe maker working with the hides he has on hand. He is not easily changeable but it takes a lot to change him. We live rationally in accordance with the good virtue in our soul. Virtue is moral and intellectual

    - **Note:** Happiness is making the best with what we have. We shouldn’t pursue false precision only what the science allows we can be more exact in math than science. Understand the limits of our models.
      When you do something conduct a careful inquiry don’t remain ignorant.
      We have a main task of life which we must not subordinate to minor daily tasks don’t focus on the day to day so much you can’t live. We must investigate what makes us happy our first core principles and live that way true happiness is a life lived with deep virtue.
      There are proximate and root causes to actions you build a house to build it but the goal is the happiness that house and building it gives you not the actual house. Deeper metaphysical meaning of actions.
      We must act with our unique differentiation leverage our skills and follow our interests. The good shoe maker works with the hides he has on hand we must work with the raw materials life has given us.
      Live purposefully with a deep knowledge of your main task. Don't get lost along the way. Life is lives with virtue ultimate deep virtues. Live rationally for the ultimate end
