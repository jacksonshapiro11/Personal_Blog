  Speaker 1
  Ethereum is like Bitcoin, but with the addition of programmability, which really changes the game that Ethereum is playing. Ethereum's programmability evolves Ethereum beyond just being a scarce digital asset to being able to host an entirely online digital economy. This programmability enables Ethereum to be a platform for financial applications. Much like how the App Store and the Google Play Store are developer platforms for consumer apps, the Ethereum blockchain is a developer platform that enables consumer financial applications That offer services that are familiar to Wall Street. Exchanges, banking, marketplaces, borrowing and lending services, even asset creation and industry products. Ethereum an open platform for anyone to build whatever financial application that they can imagine. Since Ethereum is an internet -based protocol, it has internet -scaled distribution. The applications on Ethereum are accessible to anyone with an internet connection, making these applications on Ethereum some of the most widely used and fastest growing financial Service applications that have ever existed. Demand for these on -chain applications on Ethereum produce $2 -3 billion in yearly revenue for the protocol, which Ethereum turns into a stock buyback for its native currency ETH, Which materially impacts the available supply of ETH on secondary markets, making it very price sensitive to marginal demand. So, if you're bullish on the growth and adoption of crypto and blockchain technology at large, the Bitcoin ETF simply doesn't offer that exposure. You need the ETH ETF.
  Speaker 2
  Thank you. Thank you. Well done, David. That was great. A plus. Where do I buy my Ethereum ETF, huh? I almost want to sell my regular ETH and buy the ETF now. I buy just the ETF. Yeah, that was great. All right, so tell me, you went with platform. You went with kind of open internet protocol, but you didn't say the word protocol, but you said apps. You named a number of the actual apps, like you said, exchanges, which are big, and people are thinking about that. Also said a banking, which kind of links both TradFi and sort of crypto native type things. What narratives, it felt like you touched on a number of narratives. You definitely didn't touch on internet bond or ultrasound money or any of the internal crypto ones, but you did do some tokenization -esque stuff. You did do some app store. I said asset creation.
  Speaker 1
  I didn't say the word tokenization. That's probably a miss on my part. I could have added tokenization in there somewhere specifically. I just said even asset creation and indices.
  Speaker 2
  Yeah. So what were you thinking? What was that pitch about? What were you trying to do? Okay.
  Speaker 1
  So I wanted to break it down into three parts. And first was apps and developer platform, which was meant to hopefully lead into being an internet economy. And so this was the thing that we didn't really talk about as a narrative in the first seven, but I think it's definitely worth, worth like trying to trigger the imaginations of. If we're trying to be ambitious with this pitch, the thing that we should strive for is thinking of Ethereum as hosting an internet -based economy. We know that there's commerce on the internet, but we also know it's not internet -native. Visa, MasterCard, Zelle, these aren't internet -native. Bitcoin is internet -native. Can we get people to think about internet -native GDP, an internet -native economy? That's what I was trying to get with internet -scale distribution of its financial apps.
  Speaker 2
  That's your way to ... The internet economy is your way to spoon feed them a future idea of an internet bond. Once you have an internet economy with its own GDP and it's self -sustaining taxes and economics, then you can start to pill them on internet bond. Then they get ready for that later.
  Speaker 1
  Totally. Yes. Yeah. And so first you have to get them comfortable with commerce on Ethereum, tokens moving around Ethereum, BlackRock tokenizing Buildle, and that's moving around Ethereum. Then you can wake them up to like, well, doing all of that costs fees that goes into revenue for the protocol, which is issues and ETH buyback. That's why we call it gas. And then you can just talk about all the other things. But it's really true. You load up the idea of this sci -fi economy that's native on the internet, and then you can back into some of the other more complicated things. That was my thought process. Getting the idea of the internet economy in Ethereum is that platform, that was what my goal was.
  Speaker 2
  Open Dev platform, imply that, and then also the internet economy, seeding them with that. You're talking about some use cases that they're familiar with and apps that they're familiar with and seeding all of that. That was great. Nice job, man. We sold some Ethereum ETF already. I know. Can we sell some more?
  Speaker 1
  Can you sell some more? Yeah.
  Speaker 2
  Well, all right. Let's hear yours, sir. All right. I'll give it a try here. Bitcoin is one asset. It's just Bitcoin. Ethereum is all possible assets, which is bigger, gold or all the assets in the world? Bitcoin was designed to secure one asset, just Bitcoin. Ethereum is a general purpose platform designed to secure everything else, stablecoins, loans, equities, bonds, derivatives, everything in finance. The word for this is tokenization. People like Larry Fink are saying, every, bond, and asset will be tokenized on a global ledger. And even he's thinking too small. Tokenization isn't just the assets of the past, it's the assets of the future. AI compute, personal data, social status, and celebrity. Everything will be tokenized. Ethereum is a global computing to tokenize and program any asset. Ethereum adds property rights to the internet. Now, tokenization can and will happen on other platforms, but Ethereum is positioned as the strongest contender to ride the tokenization wave. There's 100 million people that own ETH, 100,000 developers that actively contribute to the code. Already, Ethereum settles more than the Visa network, and it's just getting started. So now let's talk about ETH. The cryptocurrency of Ethereum is called ETH and has investable economics including an algorithmic buyback and dividend program that drives billions per year in earnings to ETH Holders. This number grows as the network expands. You can build a DCF model on ETH as you would with any stock, a stock maybe like Nvidia. And because ETH is extremely secure and decentralized like Bitcoin, more and more people are seeing ETH as a complement to Bitcoin as a store of value. While Bitcoin has greater certainty of supply, Ethereum pays a dividend and is deflationary, with the upside of an entire token economy. Bitcoin is exposure to digital gold. Ethereum is exposure to everything else. I own both, but if I could only pick one, I'd pick the super set. ([TimeÂ 0:29:05](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3753481e-0747-430b-82ef-e898e0b656a0))
