  Is that a requirement? Is it a catalyst? Or is it just a simple coincidence of fate?
  Speaker 1
  Well, it's not a requirement. Some people with happy childhood do quite well. But it certainly is true that a lot of really driven people are driven because they're harnessing the demons of their childhood. Even Barack Obama's sentence in his memoirs, which is I think every successful man is either trying to live up to the expectations of his father or live down the sense of his father. And for Elon, it's especially true because he had both a violent and difficult childhood and a very psychologically problematic father. He's got those demons dancing around in his head. And by harnessing them, it's part of the reason that he does riskier, more adventurous, wilder things and maybe I would ever do.
  Speaker 2
  You've written that Elon talked about his father and that at times it felt like mental torture, the interaction with him during his childhood. Can you describe some of the things you've learned? ([Time 0:10:48](https://share.snipd.com/snip/343f8dc2-efad-4733-8658-ed33d458a051))
    - **Note:** Elon had a difficult childhood and feuded with his dad that drive him to be great story if the father embedded in the son. He learned how to fight back from a young age now he and his dad don’t talk. Abuse dad. Elon can be mean and ruthless emotional swings but it’s hard being in the arena issacson said he would hate to do that it wouldn’t work for him. He knew his demons and skills and harnessed it. Know your super power and leverage that. Often these people are misfits and escape by going within and Elon doesn’t care about people but he needs to accomplish these big world changing goals it’s what drives him. Reality distortion field these people see impossible things like bending light or going to space and then start to think how they could do it they don’t accept common wisdom. He is a visual and first principles thinker understands base paradigms well so he can transcend them. Visually can see how things exist in the world. We have too many referees and admins which are important to have in some capacity and not enough people willing to walk blind through a Forrest trying to find something that might not be there. How do you balance being hard enough to achieve greatness and being nice. Is there even a trade off or is that impossible. There’s a people who would rather work until two and people who need work life balance know what you are don’t fool yourself.

    - **Note:** The most important thing you build isn’t a product but a team. Find the right talent and promote them give them a ton of rope and throw them in the deep end. Excellence trustworthy and drive. He is a serial tasker he doesn’t multitask. He will give what’s in front of him 100% focus and switch between his 7 companies throughout the day but he’s never distracted. Urgency and deep focus. Great man vs arc of history theory which is true. Isaacson sees himself as more of a story teller than a preacher. There’s a lot of genius but you need to creativity and grit to actually do something and not stay a wasted genius. People want to talk if you’re willing to just listen. Don’t ask leading questions people won’t to talk and feel heard. Respect silences even if it’s been a couple minutes. Give people credit for their ideas. Be self aware examine your life and am active participant within it. Pursue thick desires. Make sure you become a part of a community and something bigger than you need support for growth.
