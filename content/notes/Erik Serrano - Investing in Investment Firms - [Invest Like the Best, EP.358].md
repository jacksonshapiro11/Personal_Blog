  But for me, it's really important to get to know the person because you're really underwriting this person's decision making 10 years into the future. Like the markets will change a lot more than the person will change. And yet we focus a lot on the market and the strategy, but less on the person. And so I have this really fun and privileged access to getting to know the person and the characteristics that show up repeatedly about what makes a good GP, what makes a good investment From founders that they have attributes that create two things. One is resilience and one is very in perception. So if you double click into each of those and turn, resilience is never giving up. It's just getting up when you're knocked down, when you're feeling like you don't want to get out of bed in the morning and being an entrepreneur has that. Everything goes wrong all the time. And the bad news and difficulties actually flow upwards. You know, people think it's great to be the boss and to be a founder, but actually all the hard problems go up to you. So a high percentage of your day is just dealing with problems and hard things. And so that's less fun. And so resilience needs to come from a place where you love what you do so much that all this discouraging news and obstacles in the way and things going wrong and blowing up all the time Are not going to discourage you from remaining focused on your investment strategy.

  And often that's a real issue. LPs do and need to be very careful about assessing what is the patience, downside, appetite, particularly an open ended or sort of public markets investment firms. What are the tolerances there of other investors? Because other investors will, it's not only the investment strategy risk, but other investors behavior will become a risk for you as an investor. So there's other things that we're helping on pre-investment and post-investment. It's more about being a support function for how do we do this new thing? We built a lot of business with right now, so we understand on the lifecycle what is happening for five, six years down the line. We call it future proofing because you don't know what the demands are going to be in the future. So you structure in a way that you future proof it so that you know that your product is lifecycle insulated from the demands future on. But that's not smart or common sense. No matter what, amazing.
