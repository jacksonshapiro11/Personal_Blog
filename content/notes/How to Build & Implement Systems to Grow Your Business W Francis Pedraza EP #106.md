### Highlights

- Control Through Capital Efficiency
  Summary:
  In the venture capital landscape, companies often face fragility due to dependency on external funding, which can diminish founder control as investors gain board seats.
  The sovereignty approach advocates for raising minimal capital to achieve profitability and escape velocity, which varies from burning cash to generating surplus revenue. A sustainable model focuses on long-term capital allocation, facilitating growth through retained earnings rather than relying on additional funding rounds.
  Effective capital allocation involves managing resources across various strategic avenues, such as reinvesting in the business, starting new ventures, or pursuing acquisitions.
  This approach results in different exit strategies, emphasizing value creation through buybacks, dividends, or secondary transactions rather than traditional IPOs and mergers.

  And you know that if you don't raise the next round, you might actually go bust, because it's a loss -making company. So it's very fragile. You really need to kind of get very lucky. You're dependent on capital markets to agree with you. And you pretty quickly lose control of your board because these people writing big checks are taking board seats. And so usually by the series A or B, you no longer have real control of your company. That's the venture game. The sovereignty game is raise as little capital as possible to get to profitability at scale. We call that escape velocity. Escape velocity has different levels. So level negative one, you're losing money, you're burning money. Zero is break even. One is you're making money, but not enough money to really optimally reinvest in the company. Level two is you're making enough money to optimally reinvest in the company, and it's compounding and growing. Level three is you're generating capital, but not enough to allocate meaningfully. And level four is you actually are now generating enough capital to allocate. You're a capital allocator and you're compounding. And the time horizon is very long in the sovereignty game. You're shooting for 20 plus years. And so because you've done it capital efficiently, in our case, with $6 million in six years, we got to an $11 million revenue run rate generating a million dollars of profit. And after that, we were able to just use that profit to keep growing the business. And we're now at 25% EBITDA margins. So we're shooting for at least a 60 million EBITDA exit run rate for the year, if not higher. That means that we're, and next year if we hit our targets, we'll generate over 100 million of EBITDA. We're making a lot of profit per month. That allows us to fuel innovation in the business, to reinvest in the business, to start new companies, to invest in companies, and someday it allows to buy companies. And that's what capital allocators do. There's eight buckets in capital allocation. You can either keep the cash on balance sheet as insurance for a rainy day. You can pay off any debt that you've raised. You can reinvest in your business. You can start new businesses. You can invest in businesses. You can buy businesses. You can do buybacks or dividends. And those are the eight buckets. And so the sovereignty game ends up with a very different exit mechanism. So there's five ways equity turns into money. Equity turns into money through an IPO, through an M &A, through a dividend, through a buyback, or through a secondary. The first two are associated with the venture game, IPO and M &A. Sell the company or IPO the company. The other three are associated with the sovereignty game, either buyback stock, the company's buying back stock from shareholders. They see what SpaceX is doing, right? ([Time 0:13:48](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7ee04522-2851-4eb6-aa86-f96366d8fe48))

- Embrace Ownership for True Accountability
  Summary:
  Fostering transparency within a business creates internal accountability and promotes a culture of ownership among team members.
  By treating each other as partners rather than employees, organizations can effectively address tough strategic questions such as long-term planning and operational challenges. This ownership culture contrasts with common practices in venture-backed businesses, where shareholders may prioritize capital scaling over employee engagement, viewing personnel as commodities rather than valuable contributors to success.
  Such dynamics can hinder the collaborative environment necessary for innovation and problem-solving.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  But it forced us to be really transparent. And actually, it created a kind of internal accountability where it's like, I had to answer tough questions. What's our 12 -month plan? What's our long -term plan? How are we going to fix these problems in the business model? And it created that sort of internal culture. And we call it an owner operator or an ownership culture. We call each other partners not not not employees. I love that. I want to work in pretty much any any services business certainly. But then you know why aren't most venture back businesses like this. And I think the assumption is well you know it the software is doing most of the work the people are kind of commodities, what really matters is having the capital to scale it. But actually, I think most of the time it's because the board doesn't want to share the pie. And this is where, you know me, I'm a capitalist. I sound a little bit like I'm not right now.

    - **Note:** Create incentive allotment by allowing employees to own stock. He knew how much of his company would stay if they had to go into ramen mode. It was 100% of the company early on but got lower with time. Capital scarcity creates efficiency. When you don’t have money it can be a great gift. Empower employees to solve problems. Create open minded state of creation. Reward people who take risk.
- Empower Through Outsourcing
  Summary:
  A transformative paradigm in entrepreneurship is emerging, centered on the outsourcing of nearly all business functions, potentially leading to 50-90% of work being outsourced by the end of the century.
  This model encourages the idea of a company being effectively managed by a small core team that generates unique intellectual property (IP), while vendors integrate seamlessly into the operational fabric of the business. This shift redefines what it means to be part of a team, with vendors becoming indistinguishable from full-time employees in their commitment and effectiveness.
  The insights suggest that early revenue generation is critical for sustained growth, and the focus should be on creating a profitable business foundation before pursuing expansive visions or moonshots.
  Adversities and failures in business journeys serve as pivotal learning points that contribute to long-term success, shaping resilience and growth.
  Embracing a beginner's mindset and cultivating a culture of innovation can lead to agile and dynamic problem-solving capabilities, fostering a future where rapid innovation and value creation thrive.

  I introduced him to Mark Gray, and Mark hired him to basically build our external revenue. By the end of the year, I think we're going to do $3 million run rate from our hiring as a service business from external clients. So Invisible is no longer the only client of Mark and his team. They have revenue and it's already profitable. And so I'm pushing them to scale that business because next year, by the end of the year, they could be at 10 million plus revenue. And they should be able to grow at 100% plus growth rates for many years until they're over 100 mil run rate. And so the demo I want to give at Abundance360, and I don't know if we'll be ready by next year, but if not, it'll be the year after. I want to go on stage and take Sam Altman's thing that he talks about, which I've been talking about for a decade too, is the one -person unicorn. Could you have one person or a very, very small team build a billion -dollar business without having to hire a huge finance team, a huge sales team, a huge operations team, a huge marketing Team, a huge people team? I would love to be able to build a business in an hour on stage. And we can source the idea from the audience by the domain and then basically create, delegate all the operations to invisible. And we'll have hiring as a service run by zero. And we have basically a consulting business called Ascendancy that's our McKinsey Bay and BCG competitor. So that'll run all the strategy in the advisor program and shareholder relations. We're building a marketing and design agency called RAD. So RAD will be our marketing team and our design team. And we have a few more that we're incubating. Eventually, we'll have sales as a service and finance as a service. Unlimited financial services will be the name of... We just hired the CEO for that. And so, that'll be our KPMG, PwC, Deloitte, and EY competitor. And so ,'ll basically have all the functions of your business outsourced and you won't need to hire anyone other than the core team generating the core IP that are truly asymmetric, Nonlinear, high leverage founders. And I think this will create a new era in entrepreneurship because it will change the idea of what it means to be on a team. Right now, the assumption is if you're only on a team if you are a full -time W2 employee. But what if we hold this as our standard of excellence as a vendor is when our clients forget that we're not on their team. When we're so integrated in their company and their processes, when we're so aware of their strategy and their goals and their OKRs, when we're able to add that kind of nonlinear value That they're like, yeah, invisible's on the team. Like, you know, that's, I think, how Grace feels at OpenAI. Like, she's on the team. So that's the goal is like, what if the majority of your team members are actually vendors and you don't even care? It's just osmotic. Right now, only 10% of work is outsourced by the end of the century I think it could be 50 to 90 percent.

  It's the speed the speed of innovation the speed of creation the speed of problem solving the agility If you were gonna go back in time to The Francis I met 15 years ago You're just getting Started on Everest and give yourself the most you know distilled advice you could do. What would that be? Oh.
  Speaker 1
  You're like, find me some time to think, have you asked yourself this question? Like, what would you give young Peter? Yeah. Like, would you, would you create a consequence?
  Speaker 2
  Let me answer that question. So, um, I think, uh, uh, first of all, young Peter went after medicine to make his parents happy versus what I wanted to do, right, early on, which was space. I want to jokingly say, you know, buy Apple and Amazon and Google early on when it's, I think it was really focused on the core business and building something that is profitable and generating Value and create something that's real versus building pie in the sky. My early ventures in space were such, you know, insert $100 million here and work on something for a long time and eventually build it versus start generating real business and revenue On day one and build upon a profitable ongoing business. It's one of the biggest challenges in the space business, the amount of capital required to get to a point where you're actually able to achieve orbital velocity, so to speak. That was a very, very different. How do you balance that moonshot desire at the same time that you want to build a real business early, in that juxtapositioning. For me, I finally got clarity about you need to get to revenue early, start a team that's working together and generating capital and generating profits, and then get a clear roadmap From there to your moonshot. But don't start at the full moonshot level. For me, that was an important insight. How about you? What was it? What failed your lessons? What lessons would you bring back?
  Speaker 1
  So I mentor and invest in... We started an investing program and we'll get to that in a second. Visionary Ventures is the name of our investment arm. And as we're starting to invest in other entrepreneurs and I'm starting to mentor younger entrepreneurs, I'm finding myself in this strange position of giving advice. But I still think of myself as a white belt and as a beginner. I hope I never lose that. You want to be in a beginner state of mind all the time to really perceive the world and learn the lessons that are all around us all the time.
