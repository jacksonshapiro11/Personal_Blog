  A lot of the time people ask about, what would you do if you were in your twenties and pieces of advice? Very rarely here people get asked about what you would do if you were in your thirties. So what advice would you give to people that are in their thirties or entering their thirties about how to operate in life?
  Speaker 1
  I think it's really situational. I don't think there's a user's manual. I think there's some best practices and I don't think it's that much different than in your twenties. The first is very primal. I think every person in their twenties and thirties should lift heavy weights and run long distances in their brain and in the gym. Push yourself really hard. When you're in your twenties and thirties, you don't even realize, how old are you? 30 full. Okay, so like you look like a beast and in 20 years, you're just going to look back on how strong you were and just marvel at it and you're going to wish as strong as you were that you even push yourself harder. I rode crew. It was such a valuable part of my life. I did at the age of 19 and I remember in the midst of a race, it's a 2000 meter race and I remember not being able to feel my legs starting to black out and having to concentrate on not blacking out from exhaustion. And the oxygen or the air going down my esophagus was on fire.
  Speaker 2
  It tastes like blood and metal in your throat. Yeah.
  Speaker 1
  And that was at 800 meters and you go 2000 and that ability, just when you think, just when you think you can't take anymore, that means you're about a third of the way to your limits as a human, as a species. Learning that as a young man or woman is a blessing because what it means is you have the confidence that when things are hard, physically, emotionally, mentally, you realize, oh my God, I could take so much more and still be fine. And when I worked, my first job was a Morton Stanley and investment bank and I was under educated relative to my peer group. Not because I didn't go to a great school. I went to UCLA, but I spent the majority of my five years there making bongs out of household items and watching Planet of the Apes. So I wasn't as skilled as my peer group. So I decided every Tuesday morning I was going to come into work and I wasn't going to leave till Wednesday night. And I'm like, I can do that. I'm physically really strong. I'm mentally really strong. And it sent a signal to the rest of the organization that I came to play. Develop that kind of grid and strength emotionally, physically and intellectually, in your 20s and 30s. You're capable of it. You're just going to look back on that air and be like, just marvel it out of fucking control strong. You are both mentally and physically to get to a city, if you can. And that sounds very practical or wrote, but you'd rather be good in a big city than great in a small city. Before you collect dogs and kids, you know, being in a city is like playing tennis with Roger Federer and Nadal. When you play with people much better than you, your game gets much better. You're playing against the best when you're in a city. Find, create as many opportunities to find a mate. Now, what do I mean by that? Get out as often as possible, accept invitations, force yourself to go out, force yourself to meet strangers, develop the skills, start whenever you're waiting in line at Starbucks, talk to the person in front of you, talk to the person behind you, develop the skills to begin opening and establishing relationships. And it's uncomfortable. And it means getting used to rejection. And by the way, the only thing I can guarantee you in life is rejection. And the only thing I can guarantee a lot of, if you want to be successful is a shit ton of rejection. Being an entrepreneur just means you're willing to take out a big spoon and eat shit all the time. Talking people into working for you, talking clients into, to, to, to, engaging you, talking investors into investing and having 90 plus percent of them saying no. And the same is true with successful mating. The most important decision you'll make in your 20s and 30s is where you live, where you work, what industry you go into. It's who you decide to partner with, specifically who you decide to ultimately have kids with. And I have close friends who are monstrously successful by every external metric. And they don't have great lives because they don't have real partners in their spouses. And I have other friends who struggle economically and it's hard. But everything's a little easier for them because they have a real partner. And the way you punch above your weight class and find a great mate, you know, emotionally and electrically from a value standpoint, sexually, is you give yourself as many opportunities as possible.

    - **Note:** Push yourself in your 20-30s understanding you have great limits in your 20s and 30s understanding how much you can do that will empower you and foster your important relationships. Surround yourself with smart high quality people. Get out often ask people to hang out and deal with the rejection that comes with that get out there be willing to fail failure is part of growth and develop deep relationships
