Russell created independence wealth and success outside of the mainstream rules he changed the vibes lived in the world he created. Believe in your product enough to make people do business with you on your terms it’s about product quality not money or nice offices it comes down to the great product and the hustle to move it.

  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Almost the whole page it's amazing the idea was at the heart of rock aware so this is a company that they're going to start they want to be selling so jz sold multiple companies for hundreds Of millions dollars rock aware he sold for two hundred million i forgot how much he sold his liquor company for he's got a few liquor companies um he what he just sold title to jack dorsey Fit square for like 400 million so he just does this over and over again the idea was at the heart of rock aware i mean that's how you wind up being able to live in a hundred million dollar House right the idea was at the heart of rock aware the clothing company we founded in the late 90s i was wearing a lot of clothes from this company called iceberg after a while i'd look Out into the audience at my at my concert and see hundreds of people rocking iceberg the executives at iceberg looked at us like we were speaking a foreign language so they wanted to do A partnership deal they wanted to get paid for their influence of sales right they they go meet executives like nah get out here they looked at us like we were speaking foreign language They offered us free clothes but we wanted millions we walked out of their office realizing that we had to do it ourselves and so what he realized is like forget endorsing other people's Products i'm not doing that i'm making my own if you'll buy a clothes uh t-shirt you see me in this the t-shirt should be owned by me if you go to the club and order a drink like crystal or whatever Else because i rap about it then i should just rap about like i should own everything it's like almost like a verde former black photo integration and so he talks about this like forget Timberland forget kravas ca for forget ([Time 0:58:21](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1c038ae2-25df-4025-9bd1-e3271ef017c9))
    - **Note:** Instead of rapping about stuff and getting rewarded with deals he made and sold his own products then rapped about it. Told the story of a product and sold it so people can own part of the dream. He was competing with himself making it positive sum not writing dis tracks. Analyze the greats and take what works throw out what doesn’t. Don’t think of things literally but in abstraction then put your twist on it. Stick to who you are don’t follow the crowd when things weren’t working Steve Jobs didn’t go to build cheap he focused on premium always insanely great products kings get their heads cut off many people can’t successfully navigate success and can’t maintain it for decades so they fail. The greats all have longevity. The only way to be successful long term is to be yourself you can’t be successful long term without being yourself. Falling isn’t inevitable you can have it all you need to just keep going.
