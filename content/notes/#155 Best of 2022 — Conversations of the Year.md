### Highlights

- The Drama Triangle and the Role of Victimhood
  Key takeaways:
  - The drama triangle is a tool that can be used to help understand and manage relationships.
  - The drama triangle is based on the theory that we all have learned to do relationships most in one of three roles: victim, villain, or partner.
  - The pure victim has a sense of disempowerment and often blames themselves.
  - The villain blames someone else for their problems and has a line to it.

  Can you talk to me a little bit about the drama triangle, how you came across it, what it is and how it limits us.
  Speaker 7
  Okay. I just want you to know, I like a huge fan of the drama triangle. It's the tool I use every single day with myself and with my clients. So I learned this from Gay and Kathleen Hendricks. And it was originally created by a guy named Steven Cartman, a psychologist. And basically the theory is that we all have learned to do relationship most in this role of victimhood and that there are three unique flavors of victimhood. And so the first one is the pure victim and, you know, Shane, it's so hard and the hours and my emails and oh my gosh and the kids and COVID and now the masks and oh my gosh, you know, there's just all this. I'm at the effect of. And so victim has this sense of disempowerment. It's got this. It's taking less than 100% responsibility. It often has a little bit of a line to it. So then there's another role in the drama triangle and that's the villain. And the villain's job is to blame. Whose fault is it? So a lot of us have an inner critic that blames ourselves. So gosh, I should have more health. I should be a more effective partner or parent. I should be more successful or I shouldn't be, you know, blah, blah, blah. Or you, Shane, it's because of you that we're not having a good time and I was fine until you showed up. So you should or shouldn't be a certain way or them. I mean, we all know who they are who are screwed up for the rest of us. And so this villain is constantly looking for who's to blame. And then finally is the role of the hero. And the hero's job is to seek temporary relief. And that really is the key word is temporary. So I'm at the end of the day. I'm so burned out. Where's the Netflix? Where's my Pinot Noir? Where's even going for a run or something that gives me a little relief? And it works day after day. It works. But I never go address the core issue of like, wait a minute, what's going on that I'm living my life such that I come home at the end of the day. So burned out. You know, how am I, how is that happening? Can I address that? So I don't have to keep temporarily fixing it over and over again. We see this in friendships and in organizations where people listen to each other's gossip. That's a great way actually the hero. Let me give you some temporary relief by letting you vent. So I'm going to hero you by listening. I'm going to call it being a good friend. But we don't really solve your issue. We just make, you know, you hang up and you go, oh, I feel better. That was great. Thanks a lot. But now you've got to go back and we got to do it all over again. That's a way we can hero each other. Or we can hero them, let's put a philanthropy together and throw a bunch of money at a population and not really ask them to take their 100% responsibility so that we'll take more. And then next year they come back and they go, you know, we got all the same issues. Can you toss some more money at us? So heroing is the most challenging I think in the drama triangle because the culture can really applaud heroes. And so our identities go, well, hey, look, you know, people think I'm good for doing these things. It takes a lot of awareness because in order to hero, you need victims. And then that means you are requiring people to be disempowered so you can hero. And that's not such a, you know, that's how we're just going to create more battles amongst us.
  Speaker 3
  Why is it called the drama triangle?
  Speaker 7
  My sense is because in those three roles, what you get is drama. And you get recycling patterns where people are reactive. And so that's a definition for drama is repeating patterns of reactivity. ([Time 0:38:00](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e60c980b-8eec-4453-bc6d-cb4fc022e402))
    - **Note:** Drama triangle hero villain and victim. One is you feel powerless to the issues another is you look for temporary relief the hero the last is you blame someone but in none of these do you change the system and cause improvement all it creates it’s drama. Just repeating patterns of reactivity.
