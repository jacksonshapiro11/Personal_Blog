- Diverse Use Cases of AI in the Future Economy
  Summary:
  The integration of AI in various industries and consumer products will revolutionize processes ranging from creating meta AI general assistant products to enhancing interaction with other agents.
  This shift will enable businesses and creators to optimize engagement with their communities by leveraging AI technology. Furthermore, AI applications are expected to advance areas such as science and healthcare, indicating a widespread influence across different sectors of the economy.

  What is the use case that if you're doing tens of billions of dollars worth of inference or even eventually hundreds of billions of dollars worth of inference using intelligence and Industrial scale? What is the use case? Is it simulations? Is it the EIs? I'll be in the metaverse? What will be using the data centers for?
  Speaker 1
  I mean, our bet is that it's going to, this is basically going to change all of the products, right? So I think that there's going to be a kind of meta AI general assistant product. I think that that will shift from something that feels more like a chatbot where it's like you just ask a question that kind of formulates an answer to things where you're increasingly Giving it more complicated tasks and that goes away and does them. So I think that's going to take a lot of inference. It's going to take a lot of compute in other ways too. Then I think that there's a big part of what we're going to do that is like interacting with other agents for other people, so whether it's businesses or creators. I guess a big part of my theory on this is that there's not just going to be like one singular AI that you interact with because I think every business is going to want an AI that represents Their interests. They're not going to want to primarily interact with you through an AI that is going to sell their competitors customers. So sorry, they're competitors' products.
  Speaker 2
  So yeah, so I think creators is going to be a big one.
  Speaker 1
  I mean, there are about 200 million creators on our platforms. They all basically have the pattern where they want to engage their community, but they're limited by hours in the day and their community generally wants to engage them, but they don't Know they're limited by hours in the day. So if you could create something where an AI could basically, that creator can basically own the AI and train it in the way that they want and can engage their community, I think that that's Going to be super powerful too. So I think that there's going to be a ton of engagement across all these things. But these are just the consumer use cases. I mean, I think when you think about stuff like, I mean, I run our foundation, a Chan Zuckerberg initiative with my wife and we're doing a bunch of stuff on science. And there's obviously a lot of AI work that I think is going to advance science and health care and all these things too. So I think that it's like there's a this is I think an end up affecting basically every area of the products and the economy.

- Innovative Ideas from Historical Examples
  Summary:
  Lessons can be learned from historical examples like Caesar Augustus, who introduced novel concepts such as peace and economic change.
  The idea of open-sourcing technology can also be groundbreaking, even though some struggle to understand its value. The narrative of young leaders like Augustus highlights the potential for innovative thinking at a younger age, fostering creativity and adaptability.
  Keeping a dynamic approach in business, akin to retaining artistic traits from childhood, allows for the incorporation of new ideas without hindering existing commitments.

  Speaker 2
  What important lessons did you learn from it? Not just interesting things you found, but like there aren't that many tokens who consume by the time you're 19, a bunch of them were about the classics. Clearly that was important in some way.
  Speaker 1
  I don't know. That's a good question. I mean, one of the things that I thought was really fascinating is so when Augustus was first, so he became emperor. And he was trying to establish peace. And there was no real conception of peace at the time. Like the people's understanding of peace was it is the temporary time between when you're an am usable, inevitably attack you again. So you get like a short rest. And he had this view, which is like, look, we want to change the economy from instead of being so mercenary and kind of militaristic to actually this positive something. It's like a very novel idea at the time. I don't know. I think that there's something that's just really fundamental about that. It's like in terms of the the bounds on like what people can conceive at the time of like what are rational ways to work. And I'm going back to like, I'm this applies to both the metaverse and the AI stuff, but like a lot of investors and just different people just can't wrap their head around why we would Open source this. And it's like, I don't understand. It's like open source that much just be like the temporary time between which you're making things proprietary. Right. And it's but but I actually think it's like this very profound thing in tech that has actually it creates a lot of winners. Right. And it's and I don't want to strain the analogy too much. But but I do think that there's there's a lot of times I think ways where you can that are just like models for building things that people can't even like they just like often can't wrap Their head around how that would be a valuable thing for people to go do or like a reasonable state of the world that it's I mean it's I think there's more reasonable things than people Think.
  Speaker 2
  That's super fascinating. Can I give you my answer? What I was thinking? Sure. You might have gotten from it. This is probably totally off but just how young some of these people are who have very important roles in the Empire. Like Caesar Augustus like by the time he's 19, he's actually incredibly one of the most prominent people in Roman politics. And he's like leading battles and forming the second tribe member.
  Speaker 1
  I wonder if you were like the 19 year old is like I can actually do this because like I think that's I think that's an interesting example both from a lot of history and American history. Yeah. I mean it's I mean one of my favorite quotes is it's this Picasso quote that all children are artists and the challenges how do you remain an artist when you grow up. And it's like basically I think because when you're younger, I think it's just easier to have kind of wild ideas and you're not you know you have no there are all these analogies to the Innovators dilemma that exist in your life as well as your company or whatever you've built right. So you know you're kind of earlier on your trajectory. It's easier to pivot and take in new ideas without it disrupting other commitments that you've made to different things. And so I don't know I think that's an interesting part of running a company is like how do you how do you kind of stay dynamic.

    - **Note:** Open source software and innovator’s dilemma in life. He open sources things which is hard to comprehend why but ultimately he’s behind and open source is like capitalism for code creating a free market for ideas.
