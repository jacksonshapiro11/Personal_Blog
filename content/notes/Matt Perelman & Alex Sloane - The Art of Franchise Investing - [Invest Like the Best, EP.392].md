### Highlights

- Invest Smartly: Focus on Quality and Market Potential
  Summary:
  Investing in multi-unit businesses requires a strategic approach that emphasizes quality, market potential, and fragmentation.
  Successful investments should focus on categories that exhibit high average unit volume sales and robust margins, aiming for sub-three-year paybacks to mitigate risks. Prioritize businesses with leading net promoter scores and strong consumer intent to ensure customer loyalty.
  Thematic investments are crucial; target industries must be fragmented and exhibit organic growth potential to appeal to future buyers.
  Effective consolidation should enhance value, and experience plays a significant role in decision-making.
  Each investment should be approached with a clear exit strategy in mind, facilitating growth and diversification across markets to maximize returns for investors.

  Some of you're the franchisor, like you said, sometimes you're a collection of franchises. Talk through the taxonomy of these things. Burger King, obviously, everyone's heard of. Taco Bells, everyone's heard of. But some of these other things you've bought, I had never heard of until looking through your deck. There's food, there's pet care, there's automotive services. How do you think and chunk the world up? Okay, this is in this category. This is in that category. What are the major categories? And I want to start there, but I really want to get into what are the different features, I'm sure there's trade-offs and all these different things, of the kinds of businesses that they Are for those that like this category for investment. Yeah.
  Speaker 2
  To your point, we've invested across a number of different multi-unit categories. You mentioned food and beverage. Auto services is our second biggest one with car wash and collision repair. Health and wellness, particularly gyms and fitness is a category we've played in a bunch. And then pet services you mentioned as well. Look, obviously the end market or the end consumer of a Burger King business versus one of our more successful deals was a funeral home roll-up, for example. Those are obviously very different end markets. The ways that we go about driving value in those businesses in terms of professionalizing them and thinking about building versus buying the next location, that's identical. And we overlay our quality bar onto these various multi-unit businesses, which we can do because they're simple businesses. And so when we think about what quality is to us, there's a couple heuristics we use before we double click and dig in. But everything we've invested in, every multi-unit business we've invested in over the last few years has been the number one highest average unit volume sales per box in its category. Every concept has at least 20% scrollable margins. This is true of the last five or six years, which is top decile for multi-unit. Everything we invest in has sub three-year paybacks on new builds, which is important for us because it provides both downside protection in terms of capital deployment at high returns, But also meaningful equity value, growth potential. And on the consumer side, they all have the number one net promoter score in their category. The category could be Las Vegas car washes, or our wow business has won best car wash in Vegas the last five years in a row. And they have to have the number one consumer intent return in their category or micro category. And all multi-unit businesses, different verticals, but wildly similar in terms of how you can think about investing in them, how you can think about underwriting, building versus
  Speaker 1
  Buying the next unit, and how you can think about quality as it relates to the competitive set. The majority of our investments is thematic. And in order to qualify for an industry, the industries have to be highly fragmented by number of units, not percentage. That's very important. Two, it has to be organically growing for not just our hold period, but for the next buyer's hold period. There has to be real industrial logic to the consolidation. So it can't just be more is more, it has to be more is better. It has to have been done successfully before by other private equity or strategics. We very much believe, as I've said, experience matters. Experience boards of directors is a huge part of our GSP playbook. And finally, YOS, one of our mentors and very successful investor said, whenever he looks at a private investment, he always says, why am I so lucky to have this opportunity? Am I the 50, the schmuck who's seen this deal? And every one of our investment memos, the third page is always the YOS page. Our franchisee deals have led to company operated models. It takes us on average three years from when we first start looking at a theme to when we get a deal done. We have a whole process for how we source deals and every single transaction we look at, we have to have an edge. There has to be some reason why we're a strategic buyer. Why do we have a right to own this? What's one or more examples of that? Is there a common why us answer? Taking a step back, when you just think about multi-unit and consumer services, franchising more broadly, we live in the greatest country in the world. People take it for granted. People take for granted how massive the U.S. Economy is, common rule of law, financing. And we estimate for the size companies we target, again, we don't really invest on the coast, it's over a trillion dollar TAM. It's a massive market. And in some sense, we're building a firm to serve as real partner capital to baby boomers and small business owners. There's 10 trillion of business value that is expected to transition over the next two decades from baby boomers. There's six trillion, whatever the number is, of private equity going after that market. One of our mentors and LPs calls us a build-to firm for the Leonard Greens, Odd Axes, Sentinels of the world. And we love that framing. We're building a firm. We want to be the partners of choice to these founders, business owners, entrepreneurs throughout the country and bridge that bridge to Wall Street and position their businesses To maximize value.
  Speaker 2
  And just to provide some color there. So we've done 27 different deals or 27 different businesses. We've been the first institutional capital into 25 of them. So the vast majority of the time, we're partnering with a founder or with a family or with an entrepreneurial management team, and we're buying anywhere from 50 to 90% of the business. And then we are helping them not only turbocharge the growth of that business, perhaps the family over the last 30 years built up 50 unit business. And we're saying over the next five years, we're going to build it to 200 units. It's obviously a different trajectory that requires meaningful investment in terms of G&A, but we're also professionalizing the business and diversifying the sources of those Cash flow streams across markets and geography, to Alex's point, to sell it to a private equity firm, typically one or two notches above us on the size food chain of private equity.
  Speaker 1
  The first seven or eight years of doing this felt like we were in the wilderness of the wrong side of what LPs were looking for in institutional firms. We cared a lot about purchase price. We talked about that. We use very moderate amounts of leverage, tons of liquidity, and we sell things. We sell companies. All of our funds have been top 5% in each of the fund vintages in terms of DPI. And DPI is returning capital. That's a big part of our model. And the first thing we do whenever we invest in a business at the first board meeting is what we call writing the SIM exercise. So we actually write the- The sale. We write the sale memo, the sale document that we want the investment banks to take out to private equity firms and strategics five years later. And every single decision that gets made over the next five years, or in our case, three years, refers back to that document. And we are constantly thinking about the exit and the sale. And our sourcing process is very clear with our prospectiv... ([Time 0:44:35](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3562cdef-b49e-4ac3-bfa2-a532c460544c))

- Understanding the Value of Liquidity Across Cycles
  Summary:
  Appreciating the foundational work of pioneers like Michael Milken is essential for contextualizing today’s private equity landscape, especially for younger professionals who may lack awareness of past nuances.
  A critical approach to capital structure emphasizes the importance of liquidity during downturns over maximizing leverage during upswings, advocating for low leverage to avoid detrimental decision-making influenced by recency bias. Cyclicality plays a significant role in evaluating the cash flows and valuations of businesses, necessitating a long-term perspective that transcends short-term performance metrics.
  Proactively seizing opportunities during crises can lead to substantial returns on investment, with ample prepared capital serving as a critical advantage for effective deal-making in uncertain environments.

  Why do you read Predator's Ball every January?
  Speaker 2
  I think that people our age don't have a full enough appreciation for what Michael Milken both built and set into effect in terms of his creation, in terms of high yield securities, spawned The ability for private equity to exist at the speed, size and scale that it is today. And we always get disappointed when we interview younger people and we ask about that time period and they look at us like blankly. And I think a lot of the thoughtfulness of that era, and obviously there were excesses too, but a lot of the thoughtfulness is lost amongst people in their 30s and 40s today. And I think it's important to reread that and appreciate it. And since Byron, you had people in that book who were our age, who built some of the most incredible, successful companies on earth when they were even less experienced than we were at The time with far less of a roadmap.
  Speaker 3
  We stand on the shoulders of those giants and benefit from that. They didn't have that. You mentioned how pioneering they were. What is your philosophy of cap structure? Because so much of what Milken did was, I guess, create the opportunity to have a philosophy of cap structure in the first place. You just had to go all the way to the 30,000 foot view on capital structure. How would you sum it up?
  Speaker 2
  I think I would sum it up in terms of liquidity in downside scenarios is always worth more to you over a longer period of time than max leverage is in an upside scenario. And what does that mean for us? That means entering with low leverage. That means never maxing out firstly in debt capacity. On the downside case, firstly in debt is by far the easiest thing to raise, particularly if you have baskets and caps and availability for it. And when Microsoft Excel maximum leverage works wonders in real life, it can lead to poor decision-making and zeros, both of which we actively try to avoid.
  Speaker 3
  You've said cycles so many times, maybe it's just an opportunity to ask what that means to you. Is that just variance in demand for lots of different reasons? If you had to think about what is a cycle, why do you care so much about cycles? How would you describe it?
  Speaker 2
  Yeah, I think a couple of thoughts on cyclicality. One is private equity, at least in the U.S., has a tendency towards recency bias, both in terms of what they think the underlying cash flows of a business is. The distribution of outcomes tends to skew towards what's focused a lot on the last 12 months and less so on three years ago in terms of underlying earnings, as well as what is the right Multiple for this business. It's the last 12 deals have traded at X, so it's probably close to X. I think both those things ignore that, at least in our world, where everything we touch touches the US consumer, there's cyclical elements to both those things, both in terms of the Underlying cash flow and what the appropriate market multiple for these businesses is. And so we like to diligence not only the earning streams over cycles, but also the valuation across cycles. The other reason why we're so focused on cyclicality and probably because our portfolio was so in the eye of the storm of COVID is never waste a good crisis. Some of our best deals were done in April of 2020 in the depths of the COVID crisis and God bless undrawn debt financing and committed equity capital. But we have the luxury of being able to go on offense at those times. And that's where, at least in our experience, you can really generate the excess return per unit of risk you're taking. And we certainly wouldn't be able to do that in 2015 as much as we can in 2024 because we didn't have a fund back then. We didn't have committed capital. We probably weren't able to get the size of undrawn committed debt facilities as well as obviously equity as we can today. But today with 2.3 billion of AUM, tons of undrawn capital, both in the fund and the portfolio level through DLOX development lines of credit and that sort of thing, shame on us if we can't

  Take advantage of a crisis. ([Time 1:32:05](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4d30f780-ec5e-41dd-b205-08165b53c668))
