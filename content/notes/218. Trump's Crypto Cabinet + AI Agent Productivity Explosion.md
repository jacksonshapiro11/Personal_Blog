### Highlights

- Divide and Conquer for Enhanced Accuracy
  Summary:
  Utilizing multiple specialized agents significantly enhances accuracy in processing tasks.
  By dividing responsibilities among several agents, the risks of high hallucination rates encountered when feeding AI large data sets are mitigated. This division allows each agent to focus on specific aspects of a task, akin to how the human brain manages various threads during critical thinking.
  Moreover, AI agents can efficiently handle processes that typically require human input, resulting in more consistent and reliable outputs.
  This approach not only addresses human variability and motivation disruptors but also unlocks the potential for a more cost-effective system.
  As businesses consider optimizing their operations, they can take inspiration from the idea of assigning dedicated agents for every micro-task, thereby transforming tasks previously viewed as uniquely human capabilities into automated workflows. The tools and frameworks to execute these multi-agent systems are rapidly evolving, suggesting a future where AI agents can fulfill complex roles traditionally held by people, significantly increasing productivity and ensuring reliability in responses. With advancements like vision capabilities allowing AI to interact more intuitively with data, the potential for agents approaches a level of intelligence comparable to humans, heralding the advent of more sophisticated applications in various domains.

  Speaker 1
  Because I think having multiple agents allows you to specialize specific parts of the process to the point where the accuracy is high. And also we noticed when we gave the AI a lot of data at one time, the hallucination rate was very high, right?
  Speaker 3
  It would reference parts of the knowledge base. It's really smart what you're trying to do. But you're trying to provide patchwork on top of the SaaS. That's why you're doing that. Exactly. But if you build this, you don't have to do that. Right, so we scratched all those SaaS softwares. What you're describing is either a rag solution or it's just custom prompts for each aspect of each of those jobs. And you could resolve it that way to say, like, when this topic comes up, these are the parameters, this is the prompt. But because you're utilizing SaaS like SynthFlow, you're like, okay, let's create a bunch of mini-agents. I ask because I think that's brilliant. Like, you're patchworking it to make it work.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah. So let me get an example where, um, it, it didn't really work. So let's say a customer says, Hey, it doesn't fit. Um, I only wanted to access this knowledge of potential rebuttals only in that scenario. Uh, and I don't like crawl the entire spectrum of knowledge and don't even have the access to the internet in this scenario like just reference that'll make it worse this specific knowledge Only in this specific question and being able to separate that into different agents was like accuracy level like jump up times 10 um and then you know in regards to your comment on these Like sas software is like i think they're all going to probably grow exponentially they're all going to like crush it you know like it'd be great to invest in in all of them but you can invest In mine oh yeah but like one thing that like we found is that a lot of these are trying to tie you into a year long contract yeah and one of the first things they'll make in your pitch is like Is that what they're doing this technology is growing exponentially and so then these two things don't really uh resolve so you're saying this technology is is like increasing exponentially But you want me to lock into a year-long contract and i told uh brendan the the team member who's like embarking on this like project i was like i think like the one thing we probably shouldn't Do no matter which way you go is like sign up to a year-long contract with a with a technology that could be obsolete in in four months but you found that's common like a lot of them have that
  Speaker 3
  They are all pushing it all of them so surprising yeah it is it is kind of like because like for example 11 labs you know it's like a month-to month subscription that starts at like 30 but
  Speaker 1
  We we hit up these like customer support specific sas softwares which i think will crush it you know they're all doing well they're all doing incredibly well yeah um okay so so anyway Uh we we found a solution that we like right we we have this like open source tools that we can use and build upon it. And instead of turning it in from one common knowledge base that like kind of hallucinates and kind of has like accuracy, like 80% of the time to like dividing it up into multiple agents. And then I was like, holy shit, you can do anything. So I think that the best way for people listening to like, try to think of this is like think of a critical thinking task that you do. Right. And most likely in that critical thinking task, you have maybe like six or seven asynchronous threads going on in your brain. Right. It's essentially like this mini algorithm that happens in your brain to determine what the answer is. And some of it's gut feeling, but some of it's like these thought patterns. If as a business owner or someone who owns a process or accountability for a unit you could be like aware enough to to pull those threads apart of what goes into your critical thinking And then assign multiple agents to do specific parts at each process then it becomes very, very doable. Even look at chat GPT, what is it, the O1 model? It's thought of as the critical thinking model. All it's doing is using chat GPT-4 in a sequential way. Instead of just giving the answer, it's like, well, let's plan the answer out. What should be the way we solve this answer? Okay, here's our hypothesis. Chunks it. Yeah, it chunks it. Should we check this answer? Is it sound correct? Maybe we should humanize the result that we spit out. And so it might do 30 of those in order to spit out your complicated question answer. And this is where, when applying it to business processes, I was like, holy shit. Like I can take some of the most things that I thought were like critical thinking tasks and turn them into into an agentic system, which is basically like, you know, 20 agents, you know, Managing your own inbox. And I immediately saw a future which was like, holy shit. Instead of throwing up the job posting, rethink the way you do it and look at every type of position I have in my company and be like, can I do this? And so another example, we spend a lot of money on ads. We create a lot of ads. And we recently put up a post for a creative strategist role and that creative strategist role is to think of like new angles new ideas for ads to create and ideally in a great world that Have like 100 new ideas every month for like every product we have human is limited human is limited right like and all they really need to do is like understand the product really well Maybe go to amazon reviews for similar products look at the five-star reviews figure out what people really love about it look at the one-star reviews figure out what people hate about It figure out the issues that people have with this problem they're trying to solve educate them on frequently asked questions and crawl the web and then spit out like a hundred ideas And then take those hundred ideas and go to the copywriter and be like hey I need you to write a script for this video ad. Go to the content creator and say, hey, we have a script. We have a product. We have an idea for an ad. I'm going to ship you a product. And I would like you to, like, create some content that matches the script so that we can edit a video. Then collect that video and send it to a video editor with a brief and say, hey, here's the idea for the video ad. Here's the script. Here's the video-specific files that you need. Here's some B-roll that you could use for this video. Now, here's some screen by screen instruction and then edit the video for me. And when you break it down, you're like, shit, there is an AI agent for every micro step of that process. And now there are ...

    - **Note:** Ai agents chunk critical thinking. Break down tasks and grow.
- Define Clearly to Discover Patterns
  Summary:
  Successful AI implementation in businesses is contingent on clear communication of expectations and parameters.
  Companies seeking to leverage AI need to distinctly outline what constitutes acceptable and unacceptable outcomes, as AI lacks the ability to infer context from unstructured data without explicit guidance. Current limitations in AI reasoning capabilities necessitate detailing patterns and examples to maximize effectiveness in tasks like critical thinking and forecasting.
  As businesses explore AI solutions, particularly for customized applications, there's a significant opportunity for consultants to bridge the gap between AI technology and practical implementation.
  The potential for one individual to build a billion-dollar AI-driven business illustrates the transformative power of AI, provided there is a focused direction and a commitment to developing robust business models.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So maybe I'll talk about like some of the limitations I've come across. So we did a call today with this company called Custom AI Studio. This guy, Devin Kearns, he's a founder. He has great YouTube videos, by the way. I highly suggest. If you're just curious or you're a business owner and you're like, where do I start?
  Speaker 3
  He's like a consultant or an agency?
  Speaker 1
  So he built a custom AI studio. And I don't think they really knew what their business model was going to be to start.
  Speaker 3
  They just said, we're going to build custom AI implementations for companies to start and that's what they still do yeah i have this theory that like so many companies need so much help That the consultants and agencies will actually be a layer of this um stack that no one is thinking about everyone's talking like infrastructure and applications but no one's thinking
  Speaker 1
  About just consulting implementation of all of it and so you know as he's learning what people what companies use he's productizing some of the solutions he's building for his clients Like they're paying him to essentially build some of these solutions and he's like i could probably offer this one as a sass or productize this version that you know multiple clients Have now started to to ask for so anyway i i started like throwing out random ideas of like, okay, you know, you know, let me throw out some ideas and see if you think this is possible. And it seems like the limitations are in non-explicit reasoning and forecasting. So for example, if you have a process or a critical thinking task, you kind of have to still explicitly tell here's a good example, here's a bad example, here's the bounds, the lower and The upper bound. But you can't tell it, like, here's a set of unstructured data, and like, I don't know, maybe tell me if something looks odd to you. You have to tell it what looks odd so that it can find the pattern. You have to tell it, this is a good pattern, this is a bad pattern. You can't just hope that it will find things as if because it has no context right so that's that's the uh limitation i also talked about like forecasting demand and he was like forecasting Maybe when gpt5 5 comes out maybe but like really it doesn't have strong reasoning capabilities you still have to like explicitly tell it what's good what's bad what's look out for what To do when but for companies who have a little minimum of data like this should completely change the way you do some of these these processes and so um we can talk a little bit about more That what what that looks like we can also talk about like maybe what publicly traded companies are at play.
  Speaker 4
  I think I got a lot of questions based on what you've already brought up. So a couple things are like, what do you see being disrupted? If you can just chunk out everything and really compartmentalize every component of your business? Like, does everybody get disrupted? Is that the way this is going? Like everybody's gone? It's funny.
  Speaker 1
  So I asked, you know, like in one of Devin's YouTube videos, he talks about, okay, we don't know what we'll end up being, right? We're just custom developing AI solutions, but we don't know what our end business model will be. Maybe we'll try three of them and it'll collapse to one. But all we know is our North Star is to do kind of what Sam Altman forecasted, which is that there will be a billion dollar company started by one person. And that one person can essentially build these AI agents to do all of the tasks necessary to grow that company to a billion dollar valuation. And so I do think that is like true in like 2027 like that's that's that's gonna be possible okay follow-up question and i think like i like using like tangible examples as we talk about
  Speaker 4
  On a podcast so like people can like follow along with like what you're describing and instead of using your business um because you got a lot going on i think like using something that We can all have a shared experience on is running this podcast, maybe. So there's some critical thinking that we do, like creating titles for every episode or thumbnails or something. ([Time 1:27:33](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8ed30e2d-6df7-4c1f-a2e9-d809d35fe6ad))
