### Highlights

- Relentlessly resourceful recently someone had used 70k of government money only to fail to fly. The Wright brothers spent roughly 1000 which was all profits from their bike shop from 1900-1903 to build a glider including materials and travel.
  They had been building prototypes since they were kids in school. The brothers were relentlessly resourceful. This was their super power.
  The brothers were brothers and partners in every single way. Same job same house even same bank account. Worked incredibly hard every day. Hard work is a conviction. They toiled everything day but Sunday and we’re unapologetically themselves. They had a unity of purpose and unyielding determination they were on a mission.

    - **Note:** These guys were beasts they spent 70x less to be successful plowed all the money they made into their dreams with a high trust and clear purpose. Missionaries who were unyielding. Deep commitment. Better capital allocators and didn’t waste.
- Everyone should think for themselves. Think investigate and conclude for itself to be true to who you are. Free thinking and intellectual curiosity. 
  Commitment to learning as a kid their dad preached maximums and education they had no running water but they had a book collection that was more than uncommon. Their dad was focused on them learning he didn’t mandate school but the family was full of religious readers. Blessed with a great father. Encouragement to do what they wanted. 
  Always industrious starting businesses in their teens. And then made a bicycle shop which was the hot new technology of the day. Riding the wave of technology/ running downhill. They were successful but Wilbur doubted that he was uniquely suited to making bicycles or even being an entrepreneur. Play in fields you have an advantage. He eventually ironically becomes an entrepreneur and sells planes.
- They take to learning everything about flight asking the Smithsonian institute for all their materials on flight. They model their plan after Otto who died in 1899 in flight and bird flight. They make a pact to do this together and promise never to fly together in case one of them dies. They want to carry on the mission and keep going. When Orville almost dies of yellow fever Wilbur reads him the Smithsonian archives on flight. Reading evangelist and they became evangelists. They then reached out to the writers and experts to get background on the best conditions for flight. They made calls to local weather beaurus and national weather service to find a place with steady winds and sand. Eventually settling on kitty hawk. Doing the work and asking for help. Most people don’t pick up the phone and ask.

    - **Note:** They were so knowledge seeking they called everyone asking for help reached out to Smithsonian for materials. Pick up the phone and ask. Deep understand of craft and incredibly committed took steps to avoid risk to continue the mission if one died they could still go forward. Understood everything possible did it for dirt cheap on the weekends even the weather was planned for.
- He’s reading Jay bell peregrew on flight which opened his eyes to the world of flight and possibilities of the world. Made him think in ways he never had. This book made him write the famous letter to the Smithsonian institute.
  The Wright brothers had no money and little formal education but solved a problem that had puzzled humans for 1000s of years. Many like Edison and Langley had the funding but the weight brothers with only $1000 were able to do what no one could. Relentlessly resourceful.
  Wanted to keep at the problem long enough. So wanted to learn gradually instead of taking massive chances in their first few flights. Incremental compounding and staying in the game. This was a crazy but it was the best time of their life. They first built a glider and then started working with engines. Incremental progress.

    - **Note:** A book inspired these guys to try flight. They had no money they were just passionate and spent time constantly learning. Other groups were much better capitalized but they just loved it and committed more. They flew these themselves so they started small and compounded their learning instead of risking their life and dying like many did.
- They worked and had their whole heart and soul in their job. Some nights they would be awoken by heavy winds and sand would fly in their eyes they weren’t mad because this is why they chose kitty hawk. Choosing this journey is very hard but you need to respect why you’re doing and understand how hard it will be.
  They needed to go back home because they needed to work at their bicycle shop which is how they funded they’re flying experiments but eventually they hired someone else to take care of the day-to-day there so they could focus more on flying. Worked 12-14 hours a day did plane stuff at night. Follow your energy and hire someone to do your day job.

    - **Note:** They were working relentlessly to follow their dreams. Sleeping in cold windy beaches working at night. Choosing the uphill climb is hard but they were following their deep passion and they were intensely committed this led to their success
- Endure disaster their second trip to Kitty Hawk was met with tons of rain and storms as well as a swarm of mosquitoes that would come every decade and chewed them up. Additionally their flights were not going well the calculations provided by the experts that they had trusted were very wrong and the lead Orville declare that men will not fly for another thousand years this was in 1901. Instead of getting down the brothers got going and worked on different solutions. The next day they realized they would basically have to do it themselves. You have to do things other people arent doing

    - **Note:** Never give up and grow through hardship. They failed many times, but they were willing to rework their solution and not listen to experts this led them to be successful. Unique problem-solving and failure as a necessary part of learning
- His hero chanutte asked him to speak in Chicago and engineering Summit and he believes that he doesn’t have the chops to talk something like this. Big imposters syndrome. In the speech he said you need to learn by flying not by thinking and he risked his life flying these planes. You can spend a lot of time thinking about riding a horse and watching it but you don’t learn that last bit from any other way than getting on and getting bucked off. You need to be kicked off and fail to learn.
    - **Tags:** #failure-(as-a-necessary-part-of-learning), #learn-by-doing, #grow-through-hardship, #imposter-syndrome, #trial-by-fire
    - **Note:** You need to learn by doing he had imposter syndrome. True learning comes from trial and error grow through failure.
- The entire world said they couldn’t fly but they had blinders on and focus. They weren’t focused on if but on how. They’re completely obsessed with flying but capable of thinking for themselves on new solutions. Realized that everything people thought was wrong and literally built a wind tunnel and created the basis for much aeronautical flight like lift ect. Do thing people aren’t doing. They came out of nowhere with nothing to fly literally when it was deemed impossible. Practice in private and do the work Michael Jordan. People who studied this flew for 5 hours in 5 years they were afraid of failure and death. These guys worked until midnight after working 12-14 hours.
  Test iterate work long hours concentrate. Turned down outside money they were missionaries.
  Give your brain time for diffusive learning.
  Choose conflict over agreement it always yields a better result. Wilbur would take nothing lying down he would fight all ideas in order to improve them.
  They had people helping with their work but once they left their focus accelerated drastically.

    - **Note:** They were not focused on the if they were doers just focused on the how. Nothing is impossible and they increases their learning rate and thought differently about the problem which spured their success you can’t do what others do.
      Deep focus long hours of concentration counter position independent thinking. We’re default aggressive took nothing lying down. Believed in diffusive learning.
- Poured gasoline on Sparks after three trips and gliding for 600 feet they finally decided to work on a motor. Jeff bezos scaling businesses inside of Amazon. When you see traction let the throttle down. They could fully control the plane then decided to scale it. Many ideas practicing in quiet.
  Actions express priority they didn’t comment on the work of others they just went about their business relentlessly. Langley who had worked at the Smithsonian and help them failed miserably and the Wright brothers did not give him flack but the Preston he died a few years later a failure that shows the dangerous game you play when you’re on the edge of creation you can fall flat on your face. You can’t have asset and even if you do all this you can still fail miserably this is not something to be taken lightly.

    - **Note:** The wright brothers were laser focused on their goal and didn’t feel the need to say any negative or otherwise about the competition
      They started small then scaled incrementally optimizing from a glider to an engine. This was a life and death game they were risking everything that wasn’t to be taken lightly.
      They were this plucky self funded partnership that did things the Smithsonian couldn’t even fund to do from expert scientists and these guys made bikes doing this in their downtime. People make model planes they made real ones for fun. Deep commitment
- They were always thinking about the next thing to do they didn’t waste much time on the past if you go to bed with a win you wake up with a loss. They worked the day after they solved flight.
  They continue to fail but every setback was met with positivity.
  People sometimes don’t even care what they were doing and the biggest hurdle overcome is not opposition by the difference.
  The first major press they got is it a beekeeping journal from Amos route. The mainstream press didn’t care
  The best evidence come from seeking more knowledge not more power. The wrights were so well read and rounded.

    - **Note:** Go to sleep on when you wake up with a loss they were working the day after they discovered flight. They met failure with positivity and faced staunch. Indifference, with almost 0 press about what they were doing. They first got published, and a beekeeping journal. They craved knowledge not power.
- Wilbur went to Paris because the French were ahead of the rest of the world on flying machines and Little did he know that he would be dead from typhoid fever in five years. You only get one life. He demoed the product in Europe. The power of demos. He flew for 2 minutes in France in a stadium of thousands and the world was forever changed.
  Believe in people their father believed aggressively in them and supported them.
  A Man who works for the immediate present and its immediate rewards is a fool.

    - **Note:** Long and short term misalignment. Life is short and you only get one so you need to live it to the best of your abilities. You want to be where things are happening surrounding yourself with the right people. He did this when he went to Paris. Highest network density for flying.
      Importance of believing in others.
