### Highlights

- Episode AI notes
  1. The four turnings in a long human lifetime are the high, awakening, fall, and winter, each representing a different phase characterized by strong institutions, individualism, weak institutions, and reconstructed institutions respectively.
  2. Robert Putnam observed a generational shift in American behavior towards more individual activities, but this trend is expected to eventually revert back towards greater community and peer orientation.
  3. Conflict is essential for creating extreme teamwork and collectivity, teaching individuals to work towards the common good and develop effective organizations for societal progress.
  4. The fourth turning, as a complex system, requires periods of radical transformation for rejuvenation and to tip the playing field towards the future, similar to how forests need fires and rivers need floods for regeneration in nature.

    - **Note:** The world is cyclical and the 4th turning happens every 4 generations. It’s basically hard times create strong men strong me create good time which create weak men which create bad times which create strong men. These are generational shifts and turning the 4th turning is when the society breaks and creates conflict which creates the most hardship and growth. Good for a system like a forest fire but also bad to live through. Conflict essential for growth 4th turning is radical transformation
- The Four Turnings of a Long Human Lifetime
  Summary:
  The four turnings in a long human lifetime are the high, representing a time of strong institutions and modest individualism; the awakening, characterized by a shift to individualism and a rejection of obligations; the fall, marked by weak institutions and strong individualism; and the winter, where institutions are reconstructed and institutional power is strengthened.

  So the way you see this whole thing is a long cycle of about a long human lifetime divided up into 20 to 25 year segments, right? Each one a generation long, each one corresponding to a new generation coming of age, a new generation coming into childhood. And the way you look at it as the first turning is what we call the high. This is a period like the late 40s, 1950s, early 60s, presidencies of Truman and Eisenhower and John Kennedy, a period when institutions are strong individualism is weak. The country feels like it's more than the sum of its parts. We're personally modest about ourselves as individuals, but we feel we're part of a great organization that can really function well and actually change the world. That's followed by that's the spring season. The summer season would be the second turning. That's the awakening where we throw off all these obligations. We transform ourselves into much more individualistic society, spearheaded as usual by the rising generation. That would be Boomers in this case. We call that the profit archetype, by the way. And then the third turning is the fall season. And this would be most recently the late 1980s, 1990s, early OOs, right? And that's when Xers are coming of age. Boomers are moving into midlife. Institutions are weak. Individualism is strong. And I think we all have that experience of going into bookstores and every upbeat book you see is about me, myself, and I. And I can do anything. I can conquer the world. And every downbeat book is about what we collectively share. It's like the end of family, the end of politics, the end of community. You ever notice that? That really is the period we've been living through. I always think the 1990s, the light motif was really Francis Fukuyama, the end of history, right? Markets and individualism around the world would triumph. The governments would fade away. And we would just contract with each other. And then finally, the fourth turning, which is the winter season, where we reconstruct institutions and institutional power in a very different sort of the opposite of the awakening, Right? So the awakening, we think institutions are too powerful, particularly the rising generation in a fourth turning, we think institutions are too weak, particularly the rising generation. I think absolutely true today with millennials. They think institutions are too weak. They need to be strengthened. ([Time 0:09:55](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d913454b-7b98-41bc-a968-c3ff5954dc14))

- Generational Shift from Group to Individual Activities
  Summary:
  Robert Putnam, a renowned sociologist, observed a generational shift in American behavior from doing activities in groups to doing them alone.
  This shift was noted to be generationally driven, with older generations accustomed to group activities and younger generations increasingly engaging in individual activities from a young age. The trend is a cycle, expected to eventually revert back towards greater community and peer orientation according to Putnam's research in his book Bowling Alone.

  I would say that the social scientists who at a very basic level is very much in sync with what we talk about is Robert Putnam, probably the best known sociologist in America who wrote The famous book called The Bowling Alone, right? Why do Americans do things alone that we used to do in groups? You know, we used to go bowling with the Elks Club, or we used to go with the Rotary Club. And today we all go bowling alone. And he confirms with all of his data analysis, it was largely generationally driven. It wasn't something just along. Everyone started changing their behavior at every age. He said that people born from the early, you know, about 1900 up to about 1940, what we'd call the GI in silent generation were accustomed even in their youth to doing things in groups. And then starting with boomers and extending through Xers, increasingly accustomed to doing things as individuals, and doing it at every age, meaning, you know, they did it when they Were, you know, even at age 10, they did it much more than the older people. And what's really changed in American societies, the older people never changed. They just aged out. And all these younger people who were raised from early age to do things as individuals have simply replaced them at every age brag. So it's genuinely a generational replacement trend. And he says, this is not a one time, this is not a unidirectional trend. This is a cycle. This is a very long term cycle. He expects it to be replaced with a new cycle toward greater peer orientation and greater community in time. So he has been looking at that and in his most recent edition of Bowling Alone, you can see some of his notes on this trend.

    - **Note:** More individualistic culture. Bowling alone.
- Embrace Transformation and Conflict for Collective Growth
  Summary:
  The process of conflict is essential for creating extreme teamwork and collectivity.
  Conflict teaches individuals to put aside personal interests for the common good, develop effective organizations, and work towards the advancement of the community. William James's speech 'The Moral Equivalent of War' explores the paradox of needing conflict for societal progress while simultaneously not desiring it to recur.
  Just like in personal experiences, individuals often acknowledge the growth and strength gained from past conflicts but are reluctant to go through them again.
  The fourth turning, as a complex system, requires periods of radical transformation for rejuvenation and to tip the playing field towards the future.
  Similarly, like forests need fires and rivers need floods for regeneration, modern societies need periods of critical change for institutions to evolve, ensure national survival, and establish a new sense of social equality for future generations.

  So, so this whole process is fascinating to me, particularly the process of conflict. I think it's chapter eight. I talk a lot about the psychology and sociology of conflict. And the irony is, of course, is that where do we actually gather this new generational experience of extreme teamwork, of extreme collectivity of being bonded, right, to your peers? We get it. I hate to say it, but you get it in conflict. And so, that's why we go through this process again and again. I have a wonderful thing, and by the way, I just might mention here, because it's a famous speech by William James, who knew a lot about psychology and knew a lot about the psychology of Conflict. And almost everyone knows the title of the speech. He delivered it as Stanford in 1906, and it's called the Moral Equivalent of War. And he starts out the speech by saying, we all understand how war is almost essential for the extreme degree of social organization, which makes every state work on earth today, right? I mean, it's how people learn to put aside their own personal interests for the sake of the common will. We learn to deal with adversity. We learn to develop effective organizations and lose sight of our own individual, you know, monetary interest to whatever. We do things for the good of the community. Anyway, he's rhapsodic about all these things. And then he says, but could we do this without war? Now, he's not talking about is war necessary in terms of is it worth the cost or is it morally? He's talking about it as a social experience without war. How do we how do we become a single community? Right. And he says, maybe we could do without war. He doesn't sound terribly convincing. I think if you read this, I'm not sure he's convinced himself. But at one point in this speech, he has something very interesting. This is 1906. And he said, if I were to ask all of you in the audience, well, and he said there's a paradox, he said, if I were to ask all of you in the audience, what it would have been better if the United States had not been in the Civil War, if the Civil War, it never would have happened. He said, I'm sure almost almost all of you would say, no, it would not have been better. It's good. This is a little war happened. It's kind of astonishing, you know, listening to this. And he said, because no one in the audience could imagine the sense of progress America has today, right? Industrialization, the unity of our nation. I mean, he goes down through all the things that came out of the Civil War, right? And he said, I think we hardly imagine, right? And then he says, but if I asked you, would you like something like this happening again in the near future? I think almost all of you would say, no, you know what I mean? But he said, that's a paradox, isn't it? We always think it's good that we go through these events. A lot like Americans say, well, the world where two was the good war, you know, and we learned to build all these big things together, right? We came together as a nation. But if you want to do it again, no, almost all of a sudden, no, I don't want to do it again. But I think it's something very similar to people in their personal lives. I mean, if I were to ask you, if I were to ask you, Mike, well, imagine, and we whip all that experiences like that, you know, our family fell apart, had a divorce, our business field, you Know, whatever it is, right? Would you have rather that had never happened? And most people in reflection will say, no, actually, no, you know, it actually came out of stronger person. I explored places and I discovered powers about myself that I never would have known had I not been through that, right? But of course, if you ask people, do you want to happen again next year? I think almost always say, well, no, actually not. But so it remains a paradox at the individual level, no less than at the collective level, right? And I think that says something very important about the fourth turning as a, as a complex system. There are a lot of complex systems which need these eras of radical and even painful transformation. You know, this is familiar to anyone who works in the environmental movement, right? Forest need fires. I mean, a lot of sequoias won't germinate, you know, unless the seeds reach a certain temperature, right? So literally, forests need fires to regenerate, rivers need floods. I mean, you can go down a lot of examples in the natural world. And I think that it is a characteristic of modern societies with these big leviathons that we call governments or states which govern them, that need these periods of rapid transformation And criticality, right, with the urgent threat of national survival for these institutions to rejuvenate themselves and tip the playing field once again to the end and to the future, As opposed to what it is now is all tipped to the old and end of the past. And also to to ensure a new sense of equality, a new sense of social equality, which the rising generation can then enjoy once again.

    - **Note:** We have going through conflict but often they provide us with our greatest grow experiences we’d never want to relive but understand it shaped us and are glad it happened
