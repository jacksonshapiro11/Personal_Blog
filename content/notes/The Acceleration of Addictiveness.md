- Summary: The document discusses the acceleration of addiction, where increasing numbers of things we like will be transformed into things we like too much. The process of technological progress that creates things we like can also concentrate something we don't want to like and transform it into something addictive, such as opium into heroin. The world is becoming more addictive, and as it does, the two senses of living a normal life will be driven ever further apart. Customary antibodies to addictive things take time to develop, and unless we can mass produce social customs, we'll have to figure out for ourselves what to avoid and how.

### Highlights

- As far as I know there's no word for something we like too much. The closest is the colloquial sense of "addictive." That usage has become increasingly common during my lifetime. And it's clear why: there are an increasing number of things we need it for. At the extreme end of the spectrum are crack and meth. Food has been transformed by a combination of factory farming and innovations in food processing into something with way more immediate bang for the buck, and you can see the results in any town in America. Checkers and solitaire have been replaced by World of Warcraft and FarmVille. TV has become much more engaging, and even so it [can't compete](http://paulgraham.com/convergence.html) with Facebook.
  The world is more addictive than it was 40 years ago. And unless the forms of technological progress that produced these things are subject to different laws than technological progress in general, the world will get more addictive in the next 40 years than it did in the last 40.

    - **Note:** The world is becoming more addictive but the idea of normal and the overton window is shifting so to avoid addiction you need to do things weird and abnormal.
