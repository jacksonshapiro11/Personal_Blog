- Summary: Fundraising can be difficult for inexperienced founders because investor behavior is often opaque and their motivations are unclear. Investors want to invest in startups as early as possible, but this makes them nervous because it is unclear how the startup will do. Startups should only raise money when they want it, and investors should not be contacted until the startup is in fundraising mode. It is important to have multiple fundraising plans and to prioritize investors based on expected value.

### Highlights

- The ultimate source of the forces acting on you are the forces acting on investors. Investors are pinched between two kinds of fear: fear of investing in startups that fizzle, and fear of missing out on startups that take off. The cause of all this fear is the very thing that makes startups such attractive investments: the successful ones grow very fast. But that fast growth means investors can't wait around. If you wait till a startup is obviously a success, it's too late. To get the really high returns, you have to invest in startups when it's still unclear how they'll do. But that in turn makes investors nervous they're about to invest in a flop. As indeed they often are. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnqpyx6g2cxg8wffndmqbg4e))
