### Highlights

- Repeatable principles and methods of thinking in leadership
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  So I understand there's no repeatable framework that you can just apply. But I would imagine there's sort of repeatable principles and methods of thinking that you use. What are the ones that you find the most helpful?
  Speaker 1
  Well, I look very hard at what's working, what's not working. And in other words, you know, some things are not working at all. Some things seem to be working reasonably well. And then there's sort of the stuff that you're sort of humming and hawing on. So obviously you prioritize the, I mean, I've sort of separated with people very, very quickly because I think the function, the functions that they were responsible for were barely breathing. At that point, you know, I don't hesitate. You know, I move on quickly, immediately. You know, I go after cultural issues, you know, people that are just, you know, egregious violators of just things that we all generally find normal and acceptable. You know, we very quickly separate on behavior. You know, performance is something that we will give more time behavior. We won't. And that's because behavior is a choice, not a skill set. You know, I mean, you come in as a new leader. Everybody's watching. Not just what you're doing, or what you're not doing.

    - **Note:** Comes in and immediately prioritizes behavior. Behavior is a choice not a skill set. Gives time for performance. When a culture isn’t working he gives people a time to reset regroup but ultimately you need to move on when it’s past a point. Importance of attitude and a chip on your shoulder. Not proud of the status quo always want to improve and reinvent b
- The Importance of Alignment in a Sales Organization
  Key takeaways:
  - A good sales organization is one in which there is full alignment and everyone in the company works effectively for sales.
  - Sales needs to feel the support and dedication from the rest of the organization.
  - The sales team experiences the reality of the marketplace in a more immediate and profound way than the rest of the organization.

  Speaker 2
  Well, most organizations are sales organizations. And I guess I'm wondering, we all sort of recognize a bad sales organization because that business will go out of business. But what's the difference between a good sales organization and a great sales organization?
  Speaker 1
  You get much better sales organization when you have full alignment in the entire company so that everybody works, you know, for sales effectively. We will always say that we're all working for sales here because they're the tip of the spear and the rest of us are really the wood behind the arrow hat. You know, sort of the way I characterize the relationships between sales and the rest of the company. And sales needs to feel that wood behind the arrow hat that like everybody is, you know, is killing themselves to help me succeed. And it's not so much that it's all about selling stuff and transactions and deals and all of that. It's just that sales experiences the reality of the marketplace. The first and the most profound and the most profound way, right? The rest of the organization sits much farther away from the cold ([Time 0:28:00](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5577995d-b79a-46f2-a501-9e1e9d483a62))
    - **Note:** Proper incentive alignment in sales orgs. Sales is top of funnel and leads from the front. Sales is a consistent business you need to perform and set yourself up for the long term while winning today. Sales is the front line top of funnel they experience the market first. Great products sell itself but but bad products are unsellable. Need people who need to fight and campaign not the ones who sold as a product that sold itself. Sales is an active thing you need to feel beat up and be in the wars to make progress. Constantly remaining flexible and adjusting to changes like ai. Humans view the world as linear but it’s driven by change and people aren’t flexible enough to adapt to these changes. Don’t assume linearity think non linear about the world. Amping up our relationship with data to make us more productive.
- How to Handle and Learn from Mistakes
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  So, the things we talked about earlier, I want to come back to you just before we end the interview is you talked about, we all make mistakes. How do you handle a mistake at the moment you, how do you recognize that you've been a mistake and then what do you do when you've made a mistake?
  Speaker 1
  You personally, I use mistakes as it's a cultural moment in a teaching moment, because it's actually good for me to go, oh, I really screwed this up because it's sort of, you can do really well in the world by being a fast course or whatever. What is devastating in organizations is when people defend bad decisions, okay. But if you can fail fast, that was Scott McNeely used to say that fail fast. If you can fail fast and correct, you can do really well. So mistakes can become a real cultural moment like, hey, you know, I really screwed this up. Let's unpack this and understand what were we thinking? You know, what were the assumptions that were wrong, right. ([Time 0:47:48](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7e322ccd-3a7f-4a27-a2fa-d544609745f1))
    - **Note:** You can have a lot of success by failing fast and course correcting using your mistakes as a way to learn. When you get stuck in a dogmatic view and stay the course that leads to failure. Fail fast and constantly confront mistakes until you’ve fully course corrected. Worst people good enough to keep but not great the mids. Correcting mistakes once you realize ok to keep making them if you do them quickly. In the interview process ask co workers and contemporaries to build the picture of who they are then the interview is the sniff test. Leadership needs to set urgency and high standards set the bar for quality in an org you can’t take mediocre that leads to death.
