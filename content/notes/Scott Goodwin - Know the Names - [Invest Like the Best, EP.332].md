### Highlights

- Analyzing Credit Cycles: The Importance of Sector Specialization and Dollar Price
  Summary:
  The Miss Sippy Line, which is a worst basin, and the offshore credits had gone from, say, par to 50. The distress funds are all looking at the 70 50. Let's buy the Permian stuff at 70 and short this at 50. And that trade ended up making maybe 30 points on the long and 50 on the short. But you had multiple bites at the apple and fits and starts in that credit cycle. Really, do you go like COVID from A to Z in one month?

  The parsley is the crown rocks, the diamondbacks had gone from par to 70 cents on the dollar. The Miss Sippy Line, which is a worst basin, the sand ridges, and the offshore credits had gone from, say, par to 50. The distress funds are all looking at the 70 50. They're euristically saying, I have to buy the lowest dollar price. That's what I've been trained to do. And they're generalists generally. They don't have sector specialists, though that's changing because of some of the mistakes made in the teens. But they're drawn to that low dollar price. We're sitting there saying, wow, this stuff in the Permian's covered at par, even if oil is at 30 or 40 bucks. Whereas the Miss Sippy Line stuff, we didn't like anyways. Let's buy the Permian stuff at 70 and short this at 50. And that trade ended up making maybe 30 points on the long and 50 on the short. I wish we'd held it that whole time. In extremis, that's what it would have made. But you had multiple bites at the apple and fits and starts in that credit cycle. And usually do. Really, do you go like COVID from A to Z in one month? Credit cycles are in the one we're about to talk about the post COVID cycle that we're about to enter. Now is it's a slow moving cycle, much more like the 0, 2, 3, 0, 4, 5, what I went through at the beginning of my career, which was a buildup of excess in certain sectors driven by some economic shifts and changes in the interest rate environment that led to a cycle. The things in 2011 and 12 systemic, GFC systemic, energy, not systemic, but commodity price. ([Time 0:12:52](https://share.snipd.com/snip/be77972a-fbb9-40e2-9a67-10789dc8076c))
    - **Note:** Credit cycles could be macro in nature or market specific like oil. They could play out in months or years. At the beginning g if the cycle correlation is strong but then dispersion sets in so there is a good opportunity to differentiate quality at this time.
- Diameter's Approach to Providing Liquidity in Inflection Points
  Summary:
  Anchor: We wanted to put it almost on steroids of how can we be a provider to liquidity into inflection points in markets, credits, and sectors. It's that full cycle investing within a sector being very sector specialized in the research side and then product specialized in the trading side. They think allows you to make fast decisions because if you're not tourist to say investment grade or you're a tourist to high yield...you're not necessarily going to get the call from the bank when there's an opportunity.

  I think that's something that my partner, Jonathan, and I really put together when we were building diameter was we want to develop a process and we had built this at Anchorage. We wanted to put it almost on steroids of how can we be a provider to liquidity into inflection points in markets, credits, and sectors. Because the banks aren't sitting there providing liquidity anymore. They're intermittently in the middle. When there's a big seller or something, when there's an inflection point in the credit, a downgrade in upgrade, an M&A event, a bankruptcy, any sort of event that causes a lot of trading, we don't want to be just starting our research then. And if you're just a distressed person that's reactionarily looking at what's in distressed, you're going to be starting that. But if you're looking at the market every day, you're doing new issue, you're shorting. You have a COO business that looks at new issue and knows all the loans, you're forced to think proactive and thematically. So we want our analysts to say our telecom analysts is focused on level three right now in the distress space to also be thinking about whatever's happening with AT&T and Verizon and T-Mobile that might impact the distressed telecom names. It's that full cycle investing within a sector being very sector specialized in the research side and then product specialized in the trading side. They think allows you to make fast decisions because if you're not product specialized in trading and you're a tourist to say investment grade or you're a tourist to high yield or you're a tourist to distress, you're not necessarily going to get the call from the bank when there's that opportunity.

    - **Note:** Diameter follows companies abs narratives so when the right time emerges they’re not starting g at 0 but 100 which gives them their edge. Need to make an example in minute and you can’t do that without all the info.
- The Role of Networking and Imagination in Credit Investing
  Summary:
  Having a strong network is critical. It's critical to understanding the narrative of a situation. And then speed is just we give you something you have a short amount of time. We'll go through it. The networking cases are especially in credit where there are restructuring advisors and there are capital markets bankers, all these different people around the nexus of credit.

  We'll go through it. The networking cases, we're going to give you something you don't know. You can talk to anybody you want. You've got a week. How well can you figure this thing out? It's not in the sector you know probably. So how well can you figure it? How well can you not only do your deep work but talk to the network to figure out the narrative. And then speed is just we give you something you have a short amount of time. That's obvious. Because I think that those are especially in credit where there are restructuring advisors and there are capital markets bankers, there's all these different people around the nexus of credit. Having a strong network is critical. It's critical to understanding the narrative of a situation.
  Speaker 2
  We talked earlier about equity versus credit. And the idea of imagination is really important in equity investing like imagining what the TAM might be, what might become, what a team could accomplish. What role of any does imagination play in credit investing? ([Time 0:42:40](https://share.snipd.com/snip/28693fae-7183-4129-91ce-9c03cd6677cf))
    - **Note:** Depth networking and speed test. How good was their best existing work. How well could they solve something new in a week by learning from their network to understand the narratives and speed how quick could they do something on the wire. Credit is about understanding the narratives and book values rather than tam in eq
