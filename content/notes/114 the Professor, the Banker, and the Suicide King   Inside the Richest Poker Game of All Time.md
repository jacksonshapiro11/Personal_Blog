  And then if you ever have any books or people you want me to study, please keep these recommendations coming because a lot of them are outside of my view. I don't even know these people exist. So you're being very helpful. Okay, let's jump right into the book. Now here's the thing. This is a little different. The focus, what I'm going to talk to you about is mainly on the characteristics of Andy Beald. I think it can make him unique. Characteristics, we might want to copy in our lives. He's had extreme success in many different fields. I think people like that are definitely worthy of study. And I'm also going to talk about the similarities of poker players. And really what they're very similar to entrepreneurs or investors, athletes, anybody that's trying to engage in something that's difficult and trying to succeed in a complex adaptive System.

He counter positioned the strategy he found a different edge in order to win by plating with massive stacks to scare the opposition. Andy beil had so much money he had to play high stakes or it wasn’t worth it to him. He built an empire in private bad boys move in silence he didn’t like courting public attention. There’s professionals lining up to play him but he played so high stakes the professionals froze up and this amateur started winning big. He only plays heads up. This is how he found his edge.

  Speaker 1
  Okay, so a few weeks after he lost all the money, he decides, I'm going to go back and I'm going to change my strategy. And this is why one of the main things to understand about Andy is, he understood the power of trial and error and that you derive knowledge through experience. There's a lot of knowledge that people can tell you, but some you just, you're going to discover by accident or experience. So he's like, okay, well maybe I made a miscalculation. Maybe I was, I'm playing heads up because I would limit my, their ability to cheat, but maybe I'm, I'm not good enough to play them one on one. So he goes back, he's like, okay, I'm going to, I'm going to try to play in a group and see if this changes anything. But there's one sentence that I think is extremely important that, that Andy understood instinctively. And that's the benefits of exposing yourself and competing against the very best in the world at what you want to do. ([Time 0:26:16](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4876122b-8e58-4990-a787-4ca08c9da867))

He tested if heads up was the issue by isolating that as a variable and testing it. You won’t get the life you want unless you take big risks and bet on yourself no one is coming to save you. Your attention is your most valuable resource and development don’t waste it on useless low ev bets against what your real goal is don’t get side tracked. Ignore distractions that don’t serve you goal they’re death. You’re either all in or lying to yourself. Be all in than all out. He wants to find and exploit his edge that to him was playong positive ev poker that he realized the pros weren’t playing.

  Key takeaways:
  - Andy Beale is a gifted entrepreneur
  - Andy Beale doubts his abilities
  - Andy Beale is faced with competition
  - Andy Beale realizes he needs a better idea
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Now he's 24, he's been working in business since a young young man. And then, you know, these are side little things, selling TV, stuff like that. He was used to being too young to do things he did, but he was stepping up to an entirely bigger league. Alone with his thoughts, he was getting nervous. Now I remember why. I left a note. Andy Stomach lurched. This is his inner monologue. He starts to turn real dark on him. He had no business being here. This was a man's game. And he was just some kid from Lansing, Michigan. Ready to come off thinking he knew what things were worth. I'm washed up Beale told himself, I have no chance. An argument raged in his head. So Andy Beale is one of the most gifted entrepreneurs of the last 50 years. And he's not immune from this phenomenon. There's no reason to think we won't be. So part of this comes because this guy sits down next to him and they're both bidding on this part of the complex in Gulfport. And Andy, you know, the guy's like, hey, what do you think this is going to go for? And Andy's like, oh, it's going to go for $500,000 the most. Remember his bid's $350. And the guy's like, no, you're wrong because I bid more than that. And so that's when Andy's like, oh my god, I'm stupid. This guy's two decades older. I mean, he's much smarter. So he's like, OK, well, I could sit here and do nothing and lose my bid or I can come up with a better idea. ([Time 0:37:14](https://share.snipd.com/snip/18738000-81dc-4837-848b-e0bab8d84dcc))
    - **Note:** Andy was a great entrepreneur but had extreme doubts in his life and career. He realizes he could give up or grow up and double down. He’s losing a bid for one complex he doubts if he should be in the game he realizes he can’t win that and bids on another one in Waco Texas that he’d never seen and did it randomly but ends up winning and gets into the big leagues. This bid was pretty risky and stupid. He was always very curious on what things work and would but tvs for scrap from the Salvation Army fox then and sell them for big profits. He was more focused on life than school. He had a lot of random businesses in Michigan but sells all those to go all in on Waco. Ends up 5xing the investment he’s always learning and getting into new business going deep in real estate goes to a seminar and realizes how good of a business that is. He makes good money doing this he was always a bargain hunter necer overpaying.
- Andy Beale's SNL Charter
  Key takeaways:
  - The book discusses a phenomenon called 'making a seam' in the context of SNL charters.
  - Andy Beal benefited from obtaining an SNL charter just before the bubble burst.
  - Andy's timing was advantageous as there was a delay in issuing new charters after the bubble popped.
  - The failing SNLs created a demand for bargain hunting, which Andy capitalized on.
  - Andy built his fortune by purchasing loan portfolios from closed banks and SNLs.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  The book makes a seam. And I've heard about, I've seen this phenomenon and read a little bit about it, but I know like I'm out of my domain here. But the book makes a seam and probably accurate that almost anybody could get an SNL charter before the bubble pops. So Andy is one of these people. He gets his SNL charter right after it pops. And this is an important, I'm bringing this up because it's an important accidental benefit of his life. He says, so his friend had, there was like a bunch of people, they call him high flying Texas SNLs. They would offer 100% financing and weren't picking about what bars did with the money. So we've seen that play out over and over again in history. And so he sees his friends making money, lending out money like this. He's like, why can't I do this? After a friend chartered a savings and loan, Andy decided to do the same in 1984. His timing was excellent. They will look at the opposite at first because the thing is about to pop. And then when it popped, there was a several year delay in getting new charters for this. But he was already grandfathered in. So he says the delay, however, worked to Andy Beale's advantage. The avalanche of failing SNLs created demand for the kind of bargain hunting Beale and his thrift were prepared to undertake. It just called him a bottom feeder, remember? The purchase of loan portfolios from clothes, banks, and SNLs, that's what he's after. This is where he's going to build his entire fortune. He made a little bit of money, a couple million dollars because it's fantastic money for any normal person. ([Time 0:44:42](https://share.snipd.com/snip/185e336f-523d-4e7e-ac3d-e25e3f80cd46))
    - **Note:** He got an snl charter before it blew up which allowed him into the bidding for the loans of the failed snls when they all blew up for cents on the dollar. Had he not had his charter he couldn’t have bought these got in at the right moment. Then was bargain hunting he had made money buying cheap government HUD developments then applied this expertise to snl. He grew to from 3mm to 1bn. He moved in silence. He always flew coach and thought for himself he didn’t need the status he was happy being who he was. He was willing to bet big with long odds and didn’t do anything casually. You don’t know what will be successful before you do it that’s why it’s innovation so you need to take risks. If you knew what would happen it wouldn’t be a risk.
- Andy Bill's Search for a Mathematical Edge in Poker
  Key takeaways:
  - Andy risks financial assets in order to solve problems
  - Andy consistently seeks to improve and find edges in poker
  - Andy developed his own poker program to analyze hand probabilities
  - Andy focused on mathematical edges rather than reading opponents
  - Studying poker for almost a year yielded insights
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  In both, what I realized is my inconsistency of my thoughts was, in both cases, Andy is risking assets, financial assets, on whether he could solve the problem or not. So I just realized I had to check myself. I'm like, oh, you're not even interpreting this correctly. If you sat down and thought about it a little bit more, you'd probably arrive at a different understanding. All right. So this is how Andy Bill finds an edge in poker. He goes to Vegas for a weekend or whatever, gets his ass kicked. And so he goes back, because I need to learn more. So I need to find another edge. Because he'll constantly make improvements, and he'll work for a little bit, and then he'll take a couple steps back. And he'll do this over and over again, which I think is a good way to approach any problem. Right? So it says he wrote his own poker program in basic. It was very simple. It dealt out combinations of 52 cards in the deck and ran large numbers of trials to determine the likelihood of different hands prevailing. In addition, he could set up situations and run them a million times to see the likelihood of different results. If you dealt out a million hands of poker heads up, you found out some interesting things. He knew why he's doing this, because he knew he would never have the pros faculty for reading opponents, but he would put himself against any of them for knowing the percentages. So he's looking for a mathematical edge, something that they might not be doing. And this is the result of studying poker for almost a year. ([Time 0:54:43](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c56f2789-5161-47ea-83ec-944dc00e6532))
    - **Note:** His edge was positive ev poker he realized the pros weren’t playing. He started to mow down orod with this new strategies. Played the biggest game ever and won. He realized he was getting figured out so he pivoted his strategy and invested a system that allowed him to place bets an arbitrary time after making his decision spaced by 8 seconds so it took out any random tell. He realized that he would improve then fall down its part of life but you need to get back up. He realized he had an issue with his consentration slipping so he brought a friend with him to help because he couldn’t see the drop in concentration himself. Bring in others to help mitigate your biases and blind spots. Analyze your weaknesses and find was your mitigate them. Expose yourself to outliers the best of the best so you learn faster. Self belief is vital in poker. Future of work is smaller teams using tech leverage to attack bigger markets.
- The Lack of Politics in Poker and Andy's Approach
  Key takeaways:
  - Poker offers a lack of politics, unlike company environments.
  - In poker, competitors rely on their own skills and minds.
  - Research and improvement are important in poker.
  - Andy gained knowledge from his competitors while revealing none of his own.
  - Maintaining control is crucial in poker.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  They talk about some poker players labored on this. The thing I really like about poker is the lack of politics. I mean, who really likes company politics? No one, right? You can just sit down at the table and you're competing mind against mind. There's no pretense about it. There's no office. There's no backstabbing. Now, Andy's back for another trip. He's done more research every time I go home, usually for a few weeks, but most times for a few months and really try to improve on what he's doing. I think I know it might even be longer than the section I'm going to read to. It says, Andy gave out no information but collected and learned from his competitors. He's essentially engaging in asymmetric information warfare here but collected and learned from his competitors. He was aggressive but under control, this time, I should say, because he was lacked control last time. ([Time 1:04:45](https://share.snipd.com/snip/94e9f223-f112-4c0c-a8f6-abb5a5c1ee9e))
    - **Note:** He would fail go back to the drawing board learn and come back. He gave out little new info but learned from his competition asymmetric information warefare. He was aggressive but under controlled and was hard to read and outplayed them. Keeping control was vital. He was playing too long. Difference between knowing and doing and he lost focus and knew this but still could not mitigate this issue he wanted to keep playing at the time he needed to stop. He was learning the game but not learning how to manage himself. He was doing dumb things he knew was dumb. Perfection isn’t the goal you need to keep iterating and improving being aware. Impossible to compete against the best and not get better but he basically tries and repeats the same mistakes. When you know what you should do and don’t do it it makes you sick. See the path but goes the wrong way. We came make changes without being disgusted with ourselves. Use the feedback of your inner monologue to overcome what you know you shouldn’t be doing. Inner monologue pushing you to be better you must listen and improve or your a fool. This inner monologue and diverging from what you should be doing is an important note.
