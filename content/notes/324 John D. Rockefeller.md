  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I destroy competitors. I launched another series of offensives that made it difficult for him to parry. I sent someone to place a large amount of orders to the storage tank producers. This is what they're actually moving the oil in. I sent someone to place a large amount of orders to the storage tank producers, asking them to ensure production and delivery on time so that they have no capacity to take other customers, Including Benson. At the same time, I drastically reduced the price of pipeline transportation, and I attracted a large amount of oil refiners who relied on Benson to transport crude oil and converted Them from his customers to our customers. I then quickly acquired several refineries in New York to prevent them from becoming a customer of Benson's. An excellent commander will try his best to destroy the bunker that is strong enough to destroy the city. Every round of my attack hit places where Mr. Benson had no fuel, and I became the winner. In less than a year, Mr. Benson surrendered. He was well aware that if he continued to fight against me, he will only lose even more. John, every crucial competition is a battle that determines fate. Retreat means surrender. Retreat will turn you into a slave. The war is inevitable. Let it come. In this world, competition will not stop for a moment, and we have no time to rest. All we can do is bring a steel-like determination to face all kinds of challenges and competitions. To win the competition, it is more important that you stay alert. At this point in time, you need to know that kindness and tenderness may hurt you. You need to have strength. Crutches cannot replace strong and powerful feet. We must stand on our own feet and rely on ourselves. You should work hard to hone, strengthen, and develop your feet and let them exert their power. I think Mr. Benson, who is now in heaven, will agree with me. Love your father. Okay, so that excerpt was from letter number five. The book I'm going to talk to you about today is the 38 letters from John D. ([Time 0:07:57](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4ee8b996-2166-4596-990b-33fa621f848f))
    - **Note:** This is just a play by play of how John D never gave up when crushing competition retreat means surrender and he never did. Competition never stops being steel like determination tenderness doesn’t help. Stand on the feet and exert your power. John was a conqueror. Status of parents determine the quality of the children life. Relentless self belief. Belief becomes before ability. Destiny is determined by actions not origins. When Alexander the Great killed an opponent he would integrate them into his organization. Alex would take over then give you a place within his org if you were good John D would take over competition and give them agency within his org after. Achieve success as a result of their past struggles what’d his son to avoid the perils of growing to rich. Glory and success of a family isn’t guaranteed to be passed down. Shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in 3 generations. Being rich takes away hunger. Hunger is vital. Need to cultivate personal struggle. Truly happy people enjoy their creation.

  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  He used harvesting machines to liberate American farmers. So he made their life better. And he also rose to the ranks to become one of the richest people in the United States. This business genius, who was once just an ordinary farm hand, once had an esoteric saying, which went, luck is the remnant of design. Luck is the remnant of design that is Cyrus McCormick on luck is going to sound a lot like Napoleon. If you have listened to episode 302, the mind of Napoleon, Napoleon shares his view on luck a lot. So he says, in other words, we create our own luck and no action can eliminate it. So that is Rockefeller's interpretation of McCormick's quote, luck is the remnant of design. Rockefeller says in other words, we create our own luck and no action can eliminate it. This is very important for what he's about to explain to his son. He is about to describe to his son what is known in history as the Cleveland massacre, where I think at 25 years old, how Rockefeller became the largest oil refiner in the United States At 25. And he's going to lay out his his plan. And this is where right away, the note I left myself on the next page, which we're not there yet, it says this paragraph is incredible. He knew what he was a conqueror. It is one thing to read in between the lines of a biography and by somebody else. It is completely different for him to explain exactly who he is to his son in writing. This is what makes this book so powerful. Okay, so in this world of ours, it is difficult to find people who are good at planning luck, like Mr McCormick. And it is difficult to find people who do not believe in yet understand luck in the eyes of ordinary people. Luck is always innate. As long as they find someone, they find that someone has attained success, they will casually say with contempt, that man's luck is so good. It is luck that helped him. This is where Rockefeller channels Napoleon, such a person that says this stuff, right? Rockefeller clearly disagrees with that. Such a person can never have a peek into the truth that makes one successful. Everyone is a designer and architect of his own destiny. That's what I believe in myself. Everyone is a designer and architect of his own destiny. Of course, there's luck, meaning chaos. There's randomness in life, of course. But what I would really think about when he says that race is luck is a remnant of design, we create our luck, no action can eliminate it. Everyone is a designer and architect of his own destiny. I want to go back to Napoleon from the mind of Napoleon, episode 302. I know that book is very hard to get. I just found somebody found it on a website and I think it was a Canadian version of Amazon. They got it for like 26 bucks. That's a steal. I think in America, the last time I looked, there's like 800 bucks. I've seen it for sale for $1,000. If you can, get a copy of it because it's 300 pages of Napoleon speaking directly to you. And so this is what my interpretation of Napoleon is if you do everything, you will win. And so this is what he says, all great events hang by a single thread. The clever man takes advantage of everything, neglects nothing that may give him some added opportunity, the less clever man by neglecting one thing, sometimes misses everything. That is the end of Napoleon back to Rockefeller. If you want to make a difference, you cannot wait for luck to patronize. My credo is I do not live by God given luck, but I do so by planning luck. I believe that a good plan will successfully affect luck. My plan to turn competition into cooperation in the oil industry justified this. This is in time. You could think about what he was just telling you us, me and you, and his son, it was a preface to the Cleveland massacre. So it's like, well, that's fine. ([Time 0:26:39](https://share.snipd.com/snip/389975b6-01c3-4ca9-9ff5-75b8342fdc9b))
    - **Note:** Rockefeller is a conqueror over everything. Luck isn’t immate everyone is a designer or architect of their own destiny. All events hang by a thread if you do everything you will win. Luck favors the prepared mind. Plan luck don’t live by luck. He sees the Cleveland massacre of conquering and bringing the world under his command. Visionary business men are always great at finding opportunity in disaster this is how John describes founding the joint stock company to raise money for the Cleveland massacre. Acquires companies when they are weak and attacks when he smells blood. He doesn’t go after the smallest but the biggest competitor and then the others fall in line and submit to him. He acquired the largest oil refiner in Cleveland first even overpaying then was able to get the next 22 more easily. Create unstoppable momentum then conquered oil in different cities.

  Speaker 1
  That's where he got it. Other people believe, right? One of my favorite quotes came from, I forgot who said it, but it was in Peter Thiel's book zero to one. Weak men believe in luck. Strong men believe in cause and effect. It's clear what Rockefeller believes in. So let's go back to this. He says he's the only master of the oil refining industry in the United States. If I were only to lament on my bad luck at the time and follow the crowd, I might have been conquered, but I planned my luck. Anything can happen in this world. Those who blindly follow the crowd and rules, I view them with disdain. They think that it is worth being complacent. John, for our good luck to continue, we must carefully plan our luck and planning luck requires a good plan. There's two basic prerequisites. The first condition is to know your goals, such as what you want to do or even the kind of person that you want to become. The second condition is knowing what resources you have, such as status, money, interpersonal relationships and even abilities. The order of these two basic prerequisites is interchangeable. You may have an idea or a goal before you start looking for goals that can be achieved from the resources that you have, or you can also mix them together to form the third and fourth methods, Such as having a certain goal and a certain resource. After adjusting the goal accordingly, you have a foundation. You can conceive the design structure and the rest is up to you to fill it in with your means and time while waiting for luck to come. So this is something that is fascinating. He uses the word, get all your resources, get understanding what you want to do, and you wait for, and you're waiting for luck to come. The way you and I have described this in the past is the importance of making sure that your business survives. In other words, you have to stay in the game long enough to get lucky. You need to remember, my son, that designing luck is designing life. So while you wait for luck, you need to know how to guide your luck. Give it a try. Love, your father. So I want to move on to his views or his advice on what you choose to do for a living and the massive advantage you have if you actually enjoy what you do. I never treated work as hard labor without fun. Instead, I found infinite happiness from work. Work is a privilege. Work is the foundation of all businesses, the source of prosperity, and the shaper of genius. That's a great line. When I first entered the business world, I often heard that a person who wants to climb to the peak needs to make a lot of sacrifices. However, as the years passed, I began to understand that many people who were climbing to the peak were not paying the price. They work hard because they really like work. This entire paragraph reminds me of Sam Zell and the way he described it. I remember when I got to talk to him, he was 81 years old, a few months, a handful of months before he passed away, unfortunately. And this idea is like, you know, people keep saying that I'm going to, when am I going to retire? He's like, retired from what? He was always working and never working. And so I think that's what Rockefeller is describing here. They work hard because they really like work. People who climb up in Andy industry are fully committed to what they are doing. They sincerely love the work that they do. If you sincerely love the work that you do, John, you will naturally succeed. And so another thing about Rockefeller, it's fascinating, he's like, I don't even think he celebrated his birthday. But what he would celebrate for the rest of his life instead was, they call it like job day or work day. I can't remember the term that he gives it, but essentially he would celebrate every year's rest of life the day that he got his first job. So that's how much he liked work. He talks about this. I will never forget my first job, although I had to go to work every day when the morning had just begun that never let me lose interest in the job, instead, it fascinated and delighted Me. Even all the red tape in the office did not make me lose my passion for the job. As a result, the employer, my employer, kept raising my salary. I am an ambitionist. Since I was a child, I have wanted to be a wealthy man. This company that I worked at was a good place for me to exercise my ability and give myself a try in business. It taught me to respect numbers and facts. He was the bookkeeper, remember. It has also allowed me to see the power of the transportation industry. All of these have played a great role in my future business. And so one thing he talks about over and over again is the importance and the impact of your self belief and just having an optimistic positive mindset. We don't see things as they are. We see things as we are. And he talks about, he tells stories and parables throughout these letters. And one of them is this group of stonemasons. There's three of them who are doing the exact same job, sculpting stone statues. But if you would ask them individually one at a time, like what are you doing? And the first one says, I'm just chiseling stone. The second one says, I am making a statue. And then the third person is really the way Rockefeller felt about his work. The third person says, I am making a work of art. This kind of person always takes pride in and enjoys his work and often cites this job is very meaningful. Heaven and hell are created by ourselves. If you give meaning to your work, you will feel happy regardless of its size and you will feel fulfilled. John, if you view work as a pleasure, life is heaven. If you view work as a duty, life is hell. ([Time 0:36:01](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1bab4c23-fe6a-4119-b202-9bb52b1ac26b))
    - **Note:** Weak men believe in luck strong men believe in cause and effect. Plan your luck know your goals and resources and then wait for luck to come. Stay in the game long enough to get lucky. Designing luck and life is vital you need clever design to stay alive and give your self a larger surface area for luck. He didn’t mind hard work and worked really hard and didn’t mind it. He loved what he was doing and this leads to his natural success. Need to do what you love. His younger jobs shaped his career you cannot connect the dots looking forward also default optimism. Heaven and hell are created by ourselves if we view work as a pleasure life is heaven and if you view it as a duty life is hell.
- The Importance of Taking Action
  Key takeaways:
  - Reflect on work attitude to make everyone happy.
  - Opportunity comes from action.
  - Positive action is important.
  - Planning is the first step, but action solves everything.
  - Always more audacity, always more audacity.
  - Fear is normal, but act anyways.
  - Others are not interested in your affairs, so push yourself.
  - Smart people make things happen.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Reflect on your work attitude. It will make everyone happy. And so at the beginning of every letter, there's like a headline or some quotes from the letter. It gives you an idea of what that letter is about. So this one is about the importance of doing it now. And that something that Rockefeller says that opportunity comes from opportunity. And so he says to conquer, you need to do and to do again, ever to do again. And so he says, I have always believed that opportunity comes from another opportunity. If you look at the ordinary people, you will find that they are all living passively. They're always say much more than they do and even do nothing. Almost all of them are good at finding excuses. They will find various excuses to procrastinate. Positive action is another positive attribute of mine. I never like to talk in vain because I know that there is no result without action. And there is nothing in the world that is obtained just from thinking. We cannot fall into the trap of continuous deliberation and planning. No matter how detailed the plan is, we still cannot accurately predict the final outcome. This does not mean that I deny that planning is very important. It is the first step to achieving favorable results. But action solves everything. That's going to be another maximum that I think I won't forget. Action solves everything. Without action, nothing will happen. I love these three word maximums that I run across in these books a few weeks ago. I found one in the early life of Winston Churchill that I love. And then I want to make sure I repeat over and over again. It's from episode 319, which is about like the first 26 years of Winston Churchill's life. And he would tell himself constantly, always more audacity, always more audacity. And then we have Rockefeller telling his young son, action solves everything. He continues, people who lack action have a bad habit. And he explained some of the reasons for this. You know, so a lot of people are just a fear. They have a fear of the unknown or a fear of change. And so his whole point is like, you have to get used to that fear that fear is normal and you have to act anyways. Everyone is worried and scared when deciding on a huge event. But the action group of people will use the determination to ignite the sparks in their soul, come up with various ways to fulfill their wishes and gain the courage to overcome all kinds Of difficulties. Many people who lack action naively think that others will care about their affairs. In actual fact, other than yourself, others will not be very interested in your affairs. People are only interested in their own things. So at this time, we'd better push it. That's another great line. We'd better push it. Only by relying on oneself can a person then not let himself down. Smart people make things happen. Smart people make things happen. ([Time 0:41:10](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ac2e3a60-17c0-49c1-bffa-5cdaac22d691))
    - **Note:** Action solves everything you need some level of planning but you really need action. No one cares about you you need to make the world happen. Smart people look past the fear and make things happen. Not all actions produce great results but we must not fear failure. Fundamental algorithm is just repeat what works. Life is an opportunity at a time they must wait for perfection nothing is ever perfect you can’t be passive you must act on the situation even I’d probablistic. If you wait for others then you’re losing. Everyone has a time when they doubt themselves and fail and that’s ok you just need to keep pushing. Failure is an opportunity to learn mistakes happen. The initial ideas is just a set a moves you need to make things happen. Do it now opportunity comes from opportunity. Bad habits are easy to develop tough to sever good habits are tough to develop easy to sever. Don’t be distracted opt for action.
- How to Develop Good Habits
  Key takeaways:
  - Good habits are difficult to develop, but easy to maintain
  - Get rid of the habit of being distracted
  - Cultivating the habit of action does not require special wisdom or special skills
  - Life is a great battle to win, so act, act again, and act forever
  - There is no better Christmas present than this letter
  - You don't have to read the book straight through, it is organized in different themes
  - The importance of borrowing money early in one's career
  - Overcoming the fear of losing and strengthening the will to win is crucial
  - Unbearable feeling of responsibility has been ruling the speaker since the beginning of their entrepreneurship
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Good habits are difficult to develop, but they are easy to maintain. Have the habit of doing it now. Get rid of the habit of being distracted. We need this advice more than ever in the world to you and I live and get rid of the habit of being distracted. Be determined to be a person of initiative. Cultivating the habit of action does not require special wisdom or special skills. You only need to work hard to let good habits bloom in your life. Son, son, life is a great battle to win. You need to act, act again and act forever. Merry Christmas. I think there's no better Christmas present than this letter to you at this time. Love your father. Okay, so moving ahead. So if you buy this book, you don't have to read it straight through. Like I said earlier, there's like no narrative structure here. I mean, now we're going into just different themes, which is fascinating. So now he's going to have an entire letter about the importance of borrowing money early in his career. And he starts by pointing out something that he notices in his young son that you know, you want to win, but you're too afraid to lose. And so your fear of losing is stronger than your will to win and it can't be that way. So he's going to talk about this. He makes the point that it's very common. But this kind of unbearable feeling seemed to have been ruling me since the beginning of my entrepreneurship. ([Time 0:49:02](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9f0bf029-b4ea-4b71-8a4e-294642c3d1dc))
    - **Note:** Fear of losing must be second to your will to win. When he was scared he kept doubling down and taking on more debt. Problems are just opportunities for creative problem solving. Focus on upside vs downside. Don’t worry about losing. Honest and rewards to it were a tool and strategy. Honesty and good relationship are vital. No one leads a smooth life everyone leads side by side with failure. Opportunity is a scarce thing you need to learn from failure. Failure is a tombstone or stepping stone. Unless you give up you can always be successful never quit. His strong self confidence spured him on to greatness and at the core of greatness belief proceeds achievement. Believe you can achieve things then get other to believe replace the thought of failure with ideas of success.

  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Lincoln's life is a great testimony of turning setbacks into victory. Frankly speaking, I have no intention to compare myself with President Lincoln, but I do have some of his spirit. I hate it when my business fails and I lose money, but what really concerns me is that I'm afraid that in future business, I will be too cautious and become a coward. Lincoln had steel-like perseverance. He had a saying which was well said. He said, you cannot sharpen your razor on velvet. So the next letter I want to talk to you about is all about the importance of self-belief, the level of confidence determines the level of achievement. Why are there so many losers? I think it's because there are not many people who truly believe that they can do something and as a result, not many people really do. The power of faith can help us move a mountain. Some people really believe that they will succeed one day. They carry out various tasks with the mentality of I'm going to the top. I was one of these people. When I was a poor boy, I was confident that would become the richest person in the world. Strong self-confidence inspired me to come up with various plans, methods, means, and techniques, and one step at a time to climb to the top of the oil kingdom. I never believed that failure is the mother of success. I believe that faith is the father of success. Victory is a habit. What I want is sustained victory. Believing that there will be great results is the driving force behind all great careers. Believing that there will be great results is the driving force behind all great careers. I believe that sentence to be true. I have talked to many people who have failed in their business. When these losers were speaking, they would often unwittingly say, to be honest, I didn't think it would work. Or I felt uneasy before I started. Or they'd say something like, in fact, it's not too surprising that this has failed. Disbelief is a negative force. The level of confidence determines the level of achievement. Mediocre people live their life day by day believing that they can't do anything. If they cannot raise their self-confidence, they will shrink in their self-judgments and become increasingly insignificant. What they think of themselves will also make others think of them in the same manner. So then these kinds of people will become insignificant in the eyes of everyone else. Remember, he's saying we're the origination of their self-judgment, right? The fact that they doubt themselves so much starts internally, and then eventually the external world starts to agree with what's inside. He's saying, take the other thing. They believe that you can achieve things, believe that you're a great person, and then believe that truthfully. Don't lie to yourself, right? And then do the steps necessary to make that true. And then the outside world will share your belief. I always say it's like, Churchill, this is, Churchill's just on my mind, but other people, like Churchill had this fear self-belief. And then all he did, he went around getting others to believe, to share that belief, too. And so then Rockefeller goes back and giving his advice on to his son about how to do this. I replace the thought of failure with the belief of success. I replace the thought of failure with the belief of success. When I face a difficult situation, I think I will win instead of I might lose. When I compete with people, I think I am as as good as them. Not I can't compete with them. When opportunities arise, I think I can do it instead of I can't do it. I remind myself regularly, you are better than you think. Never, never sell yourself cheaply. So he's talking about not only what he did from self, but he's telling his son, never, never sell yourself cheaply. Those who can reach the pinnacle in business, mission, writing, acting, and other pursuits of achievement are all because they can steadily and persistently pursue a plan of self Development and growth. ([Time 0:58:43](https://share.snipd.com/snip/df838b66-850c-4a93-a0dc-45b7355875d4))
    - **Note:** Relentless self belief over everything. And perseverance. You’re better than you think never sell yourself cheaply. You can deceive the enemy but don’t deceive yourself. Guarding yourself is vital you need to pretext yourself from the enemies. Be ready for war always. He’s super competitive and he lives for standing owner his dead comments who are noble. Know your idea environment or shape your world. His attacks are always multipronged. He wanted to conquer people.
- Arrogance and its Downfall: Rockefeller's Encounter with Scott and Potts
  Key takeaways:
  - Arrogance usually leads to a downfall.
  - Excuses is a mental illness, and people with this serious illness are all losers without exception.
  - The more successful a person is, the less excuses he will find.
  - Only a loser finds a good excuse.
  - Typical excuses that people make are incorrect.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So even after my victory was assured, he still wanted to continue fighting with me. But he's not in charge. Mr. Scott decisively lowered his arrogance and sent someone to tell me that he hoped to make peace. Potts was not in control. Potts wanted to prove himself to be great, but he failed. He failed completely. A few years later, Potts became an active and diligent director in one of my companies. Arrogance usually leads to a downfall. Scott and Potts and his ilk thought they were of noble origin and were always arrogant. Therefore, my heart was fluttering when I successfully tamed these arrogant donkeys. So then he has an entire letter where I really feel, and then note up myself, is Rockefeller describes the loser in its natural habitat. So he says, Dear John, Captain Schofield lost again. He lost and got a little furious and threw his golf club into the sky in a range. As a result, he had to buy a new one. Frankly speaking, I prefer the character of the captain. The goal of life is to win. The captain also has a commendable advantage. After losing, he never makes excuses. In my opinion, excuses is a mental illness, and people with this serious illness are all losers without exception. The more successful a person is, the less excuses he will find. The loser will explain why he could not achieve it, why he did not do it, why he could not do it, why he is not the right person. The first action that the loser takes is to find various reasons for his failure. I despise those who are good at making excuses. Only a loser finds a good excuse. This type of person will never want to admit that they are a person who loves making excuses. And so he gives some examples of typical excuses that people make and what he feels is incorrect those excuses. ([Time 1:14:07](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9d524e49-2949-4416-9a8c-16675147b4bc))

  I became my own master, my own employer, and I no longer had to worry about the short-sighted mediocre people blocking my way. You only need to remember one sentence, plan boldly and implement carefully. And then I just want to pull out the ending paragraph of another letter because he just talks about over and over again, the importance of the relationship you have with yourself, the View of yourself, the confidence you have in yourself. My son, your relationship with yourself is the beginning of all relationships. When you believe in yourself and are in harmony with yourself, you are your most faithful partner. Only in this way will you stay indifferent. So what he's talking about is indifferent to the opinions of the external world. I really need to hammer this point home because he's got entire letters, multiple, like multiple letters where the entire letter is about the importance of self-belief. This is one of the letters and really I can give you the main punchline in two sentences. A person's self-esteem is the core of his personality. What kind of person you think you are, you will make you become that person. And then when you read through the letters and you also see this in the autobiographies of Rockefeller, I would say that Rockefeller's internal company, Gospels, that of cooperation. And I think I can, we can just, he explains this in really less than two paragraphs. He says, this is one of the reasons why standard oil is so powerful that it awes its opponents. Sincere cooperation is regarded as the most important factor in our lives, meaning inside the company. Do not forget, he's telling us on why you might want to copy the strategy. Do not forget that everyone is selfish. Everyone is loyal to themselves by nature and that I is the religion in everyone's heart. When we replaces me, the power it gives off will be incalculable. I want to read that and I, you know how it ends. I want to read that paragraph again. Do not forget that everyone is selfish. Everyone is loyal to themselves by nature and I is the religion in everyone's heart. When we replaces me, the power it gives off will be incalculable. Another theme of one letter, which is fascinating, is the importance of patience and really having a high tolerance of pain. He has this great quote where he says, only when you can endure what people cannot, can you then do what people cannot do. And so he's talking about the importance of this practice of patience and self control goes back to that partner that he absolutely hated. Mr. ([Time 1:26:46](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8b345ef9-fcc4-471f-af9b-92d8f6fe01f8))
    - **Note:** Saw oil as the future and wanted to ride the wave to technology through oil. He was working with a guy who was second rate and worked to replace him don’t work with second rate people. He worked behind the scenes to get this done bad boys move in silence. When he sold his company and lined up his financing he was worried but this was the moment that freed him from second rays people plan boldly implementing carefully. Relationship with yourself is vital inner scorecard neglect the outside world. Be in harmony with yourself. Self esteem is core of their personality you become what you think you are. Everyone is selfish by nature and that’s ok. You must endure what others can’t do you can do what they can’t. You need to respect yourself and maintain high self control ruthless to completion but employees and family loved him. But he was a conqueror. He wanted to beat his enemies. Endure what otherscan’t bear to do what they cannot do.

  And so then he has a letter about a visit from Mr. Andrew Carnegie. I guess that earlier, you know, all the Robert Verrens are in this book. There's like, you know, they may have even be doing some deals together or know each other. Where he says, Rockefeller definitely feels he's superior to all of them though, but he is talking about telling us on what he liked that Andrew Carnegie told him. And so he says, Mr. Andrew Carnegie is a tireless Iron Man. And he's always what he's describing like, what he likes about him. So he says this and I appreciate this guy who often competes with me because he's diligent and ambitious. He's like a he's a tireless Iron Man. He's always regarding moving forward as his first, second, and third most important thing. And so one of the things that Andrew said, he really said, he really enjoyed, he says the end is just the beginning as a quote that Andrew, like a mantra that Andrew would repeat, the end Is just the beginning. Success is a process of continuous reproduction, just like a prolific cow. When it gives birth to a calf, it immediately becomes pregnant with another back and forth endlessly. The end is the last stop of a journey and the beginning of a new dream. So this whole point, that's what he means by the end of is just beginning. A lot of people, you and I have talked about this in the past, like if you go sleep on a wind, you wake up with a loss. A lot of people get a little success or they get to a certain place and they kind of like let their foot off the gas. And Carnegie and Rockefeller were like, well, success is a process of process of continuous reproduction, like a prolific cow. Give birth to something, then immediately get pregnant and give birth to another thing back and forth endlessly. The end is the last stop of a journey in the beginning of a new dream. That's just really great language. And the ends this letter, where he's talking about Carnegie, and to more, more advice to his son, look at those who fail. And you will find that most people fail not because they make mistakes, but because they are not fully committed. ([Time 1:31:46](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f15dafbf-9d0d-4194-8b6d-fa6cf3043692))
    - **Note:** On carnige a man he respected the end is just the beginning success is the process of continuous reproduct like a prolific cow. He’s always moving forward. People fail because they aren’t fully committed not because they make mistakes. Hes friends with positive people who never give in not people who tear you down. Don’t love your level of thinking to others. Create an open environment in your company and cultivate a culture of good listening. When you’re in a conversation wait before you respond and respond thoughtfully. Do what you like to do the most and let others do what they like the most match peoples enthusiasm with their jobs and interest. Devote yourself to your favorite activity. Respect is an effective tool. Everyone goes through life with an invisible sign on your neck that says make me feel important. Everyone wants to be value and respected by others. He leaves personal notes of thanks on peoples desks to motivate them because he knows those will be felt longer than money. Adopt a positive attitude towards everything anything can change or be changed
