  Speaker 3
  Like, which is like, if you imagine imagine speaking language, you know, he already mentioned an anxiety curve. I've got one of those frameworks as well. So yeah, yeah. Hey, it's anxiety and a curve. It's perfect for you, Brian. It's like imagine an X, Y axis where you have low risk bets and high risk bets, and then you have low reward bets and high reward bets.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah. Right. And like, the issue is that, obviously, nobody wants to do anything in the high risk lower reward category. Most startups do a very good job of avoiding that. The low risk lower reward category is basically the default for founders. That is where the natural organization, especially with end where the gravity is in New York 100 percent. That is the thing you were fighting against. And like one of the practices I do with the team, teams I work with every once in a while is just if you're trying to hit the reset button, I've gotten much simpler in the way that I try to have A conversation about product and what you're doing. You just say, Hey, I'm going to put these four buckets up on a whiteboard somewhere. Take the things you want to do next year. I'm not, I have no value judgment. You know this product so much better than me. You know, your company so much better. I mean, you know, your customer so much better than me. Just take the 20 things you're going to build next and put them in these four categories. And that's not, we're not going to do expected outcomes here. I'm not telling you how much DAU revenue it's going to drive. We're not building some, just tell me whether you think it's a high risk high reward bet or whether it's a low reward low risk bet. And like almost all of the time, 95% of the bets end up in the bottom left category. And it's a great way to reset a conversation and say, listen, when things are going worse, you take more upper right bets, not all, but if it's going worse, then you need to up your risk Threshold. And it's a great way of communicating. Usually founders get it faster, frankly, than the rest of the board members, then you need another framework to talk to the rest of the board to make them, okay, because you also have A bunch of other contingency people managers.
